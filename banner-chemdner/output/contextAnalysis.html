PMID23223431Line147 The paternal uncle ( patient number 7107 ; P4 , II , 3 ) , although not tested , has a presentation evocating a <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation with recurrent warts associated with mild neutropenia and monocytopenia . <br>
PMID22898539Line238 Moreover , knockdown of <font color="blue">Asxl1</font> using shRNA in vivo in a mouse model of haematopoietic NrasG12D overexpression resulted in accelerated disease latency and increased disease burden in vivo , with concomitant loss of <font color="blue">Asxl1</font> ( REF . 86 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line109 Using a mammalian suppressor mutation approach , the functional importance of the <font color="blue">GATA1</font> / <font color="blue">FOG1</font> interaction was established , showing that physical association of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> with <font color="blue">FOG1</font> is required for erythroid differentiation . <br>
PMID21605981Line154 Moreover , it has been reported in a zebrafish model that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is regulated by the microRNA ( miRNA ) miR - 451 . <br>
PMID22898539Line113 Somatic deletions and inactivating mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> were identified in MPN and MDS based on mapping of loss - of - heterozygosity and microdeletions within a minimal region of chromosome 4q24 ( REFS 25 , 26 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line289 As indicated above , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression is critical throughout various stages of hematopoiesis , and its levels partly determine the fate along different myeloid cell lineages ; for this reason , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression is tightly regulated . <br>
PMID22210327Line35 At present , only limited information is available about the distribution of <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations across the main cytogenetic / molecular AML categories . <br>
PMID24986690Line52 OS was estimated using the Kaplan - Meier product limit method , and survival curves of different subgroups ( <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant , <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant , <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant , and triple - negative patients ) were compared by the log - rank test . <br>
PMID22323480Line11 We identified additional somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes , including <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> , and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line90 Notably , the regulatory elements responsible for <font color="blue">GATA2</font> gene expression also harbor GATA motifs . <br>
PMID23978506Line215 These tended to be low positive when tested in laboratories using quantitative assays , so it is likely that these specimens had <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F levels that were below the limit of detection for most laboratories . <br>
PMID23978506Line200 Each laboratory was asked to provide three DNA specimens : one known to be <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F positive , one weakly positive , and one from a patient suspected to have a MPN but that was found to be <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F negative . <br>
PMID21605981Line306 Recently , Simon et al reported that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> acts as a regulator of the angiopoietin - 2 ( ANG2 ) transcription , a gene crucial for angiogenesis . <br>
PMID23223431Line220 We propose limiting the use of hematopoietic growth factors and implementing intensive treatment such as allograft in patients with neutropenia and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations as soon as an unrelated donor has been identified . <br>
PMID21714648Line89 Mutations in six genes - <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , and <font color="blue">ETV6</font> - were significant predictors of poor overall survival , after adjustment for IPSS risk group , and were found in 74 of 255 samples ( 29 . 0 % ) with normal cytogenetic features . <br>
PMID25006131Line107 Further , we performed cox multivariable analysis of myeloid malignancy subtypes and identified that presence of the <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation predicted poor survival independent of age , sex , and IPSS scores in high - and low - risk MDS patients ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = 1 . 5 [ 0 . 9 , 2 . 6 ] ; P = . 11 ) and in patients with MDS who survived beyond 12 months ( HR = 2 . 1 [ 1 . 1 , 3 . 8 ] ; P = . 017 ; Figure 3 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line126 Recent studies have shown that the placement of 5 - hmC leads to active demethylation through the <font color="blue">activation - induced cytidine deaminase</font> ( <font color="blue">AID</font> ) - APOBEC DNA repair pathway ( FIG . 1 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line30 In the current work , we studied a large population of patients with PMF followed at 4 different centers and analyzed the impact of driver mutations of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , or <font color="blue">MPL</font> on clinical course , risk of leukemic transformation , and OS . <br>
PMID25006131Line34 The mutational status for cohesin complex genes ( <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , <font color="blue">STAG1</font> , <font color="blue">RAD21</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">PDS5B</font> , <font color="blue">WAPAL</font> , <font color="blue">MAU2</font> , <font color="blue">REC8</font> , <font color="blue">NIPBL</font> , <font color="blue">SMC5</font> , and <font color="blue">ESCO2</font> ) were analyzed in bone marrow and blood specimens of 1060 patients with MDS ( n = 386 ) , MPNs ( n = 55 ) , MDS / MPNs ( n = 169 ) , and sAML ( n = 149 ) that evolved from these conditions and pAML ( n = 301 ) , including 200 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) AML cohort ( see supplemental Table 1 , available at the Blood Web site ) . <br>
PMID20601954Line60 In contrast , in various malignancies , overexpression of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> has been reported , suggesting that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> might also act as an oncogene . <br>
PMID22898539Line140 By contrast , the use of Illumina Infinium 27k methylation arrays to examine samples from patients with MDS and other chronic myeloid malignancies with <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations suggested that there was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5 - hmC levels versus healthy controls . <br>
PMID22323480Line94 We found that among the initially screened cohort of patients with myeloid malignancies , mutations were highly recurrent in <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , whereas mutations of other spliceosomal genes were each detected in 1 of 120 cases , indicating a frequency of < 1 % . <br>
PMID25465125Line86 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( additional sex combs - like 1 gene ) is the key regulator in histone modification via its interaction with PRC2 ( polycomb complex 2 ) , which methylates the 27th lysine residue of histone H3 ( H3K27 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line151 Further work in mice and humans is needed for the identification and functional validation of collaborating genetic events that cooperate with <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations in myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID25465125Line84 Mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , and <font color="blue">UTX</font> have been identified in MDS and appear to alter histone biology , resulting in dysregulation of gene expression in MDS . <br>
PMID24986690Line86 The 10 - year cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation was 19 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 13 . 9 - 25 . 6 ) in <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant , 9 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 4 . 3 - 16 . 8 ) in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant , 16 . 9 % ( 95 % CI , 4 . 1 - 37 . 1 ) in <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant , and 34 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 16 . 8 - 52 . 8 ) in triple - negative subjects ( Figure 3 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line223 Comparison among the 12 laboratories performing quantitative <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F assays was complicated by the various ways in which the laboratories reported their results . <br>
PMID21605981Line100 The molecular basis of the ' GATA factor switching ' resides in a gene expression regulatory network utilizing the cis - acting GATA motifs in the <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> genes . <br>
PMID22898539Line139 Use of both the HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation - mediated PCR assay ( HELP assay ) and LC - MS to detect global levels of DNA methylation in AML patient samples with <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations revealed hypermethylation as well as lower global 5 - hmC levels . <br>
PMID25465125Line217 Others have demonstrated that patients with <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> - mutated RARS had abnormal splicing of <font color="blue">ABCB7</font> in mitochondria , further strengthening the hypothesis of mitochondrial dysregulation . <br>
PMID22323480Line154 When the survival benefit of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations was examined in patients with MDS with increased RS , the presence of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations was associated with better OS and LFS in univariate analysis ; however , significance was completely accounted for by the World Health Organization categorization for morphologic risk , and no additional prognostic value from the presence or absence of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations was observed when RARS and RCMD - RS were analyzed separately . <br>
PMID23531518Line122 In our study , 87 ( 49 % ) patients had an <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutation , with 47 ( 28 % ) of these being c . 1934dupG ; p . Gly646TrpfsX12 . <br>
PMID23978506Line77 Other indications for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation analysis include splanchnic vein thrombosis and the provisional entity refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis ( <font color="blue">RARS</font> - T ) . <br>
PMID21714648Line119 Both translocations and mutations of <font color="blue">ETV6</font> have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia , and translocations have been described in rare cases of myelodysplastic syndromes , but <font color="blue">ETV6</font> mutations have not previously been reported in myelodysplastic syndromes . <br>
PMID21605981Line294 Therefore , whether <font color="blue">GATA2</font> influences prognosis in patients with AML has not been determined . <br>
PMID23619563Line70 Also in the Mayo cohort , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations were more likely to occur in the presence of normal karyotype ( 37 % versus 19 % ; P = 0 . 003 ) and were not different between favorable and unfavorable cytogenetic categories . <br>
PMID22898539Line178 In both reports , the authors revealed that the oncogenicity of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutants in neural and haematopoietic cells may depend on the increased activity of the EGLN family , which are alpha - ketoglutarate - dependent prolyl hydroxylases that normally mark the oxygen - labile subunit of the transcription factor hypoxia - inducible factor ( HIF ) for proteasomal degradation . <br>
PMID25465125Line149 Mutations of <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> ( at 18q12 . 3 ) are found in 2 . 2 % to 4 . 3 % of MDS patients and 6 . 2 % to 15 % of CMML patients . <br>
PMID25465125Line164 Dickinson ' s group observed the signs of disease progression in patients with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation as elevated <font color="blue">FLT3L</font> , loss of bone marrow progenitors , depletion of transitional B cells , naive T cells , and NK cells , as well as clonal myelopoiesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line261 Notably , genome - wide <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> occupancy of GATA motifs has been also investigated by ChIP - sequencing analysis . <br>
PMID23978506Line73 <font color="blue">MPL</font> and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations are not mutually exclusive , and rare cases of concurrent <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation have been reported . <br>
PMID21605981Line286 8 . 2 . OVEREXPRESSION OF <font color="blue">GATA2</font> IN ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA . <br>
PMID25465125Line89 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations are generally frameshift , resulting in truncation and loss - of - function , with subsequent loss of PRC2 - mediated histone lysine 27 methylation . <br>
PMID22898539Line154 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> functions in the cytoplasm and in peroxisomes , whereas <font color="blue">IDH2</font> functions in the mitochondria . <br>
PMID22878824Line122 This prognostic significance was observed when <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations were separately analyzed , although patient numbers were small for each subgroup and statistical significance was reached only for the relapse - free survival analysis . <br>
PMID22878824Line164 In patients with the favorable - risk <font color="blue">CBF</font> AML [ eg , t ( 8 ; 21 ) or inv ( 16 ) ] , the presence of a mutation in c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> significantly increased the risk of relapse . <br>
PMID21339759Line62 Figure 1 . ( a ) Frequencies and distribution of mutations . Frequencies are given for molecular mutations in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> . Each patient is represented by a colored box . The patient cohort is further annotated according to karyotype and diagnostic category . Kaplan - Meier survival estimates of 81 CMML cases . ( b ) Data are shown for overall survival of CMML patients including <font color="blue">EZH2</font> - mutated patients ( n = 9 ) and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> wild - type patients ( n = 72 ; alive at 3 years : 33 . 3 versus 69 . 9 % ) . ( c ) Data are shown for overall survival of CMML patients including <font color="blue">EZH2</font> - mutated patients ( n = 9 ) , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> / <font color="blue">TET2</font> wild - type patients ( n = 40 ) and <font color="blue">TET2</font> - mutated patients with <font color="blue">EZH2</font> wild - type ( n = 32 ; alive at 3 years : 33 . 9 versus 49 . 7 versus 89 . 8 % ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line127 Similar results were obtained when considering <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - mutated CN - AML patients or when looking at the different prognostic groups in the European LeukemiaNet classification ( data not shown ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line54 <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> ( DNA ( cytosine - 5 ) - methyltransferase 3 alpha gene ; located at 2p23 ) encodes a DNA methyltransferase that catalyzes the incorporation of methyl groups to the cytosine residue of CpG dinucleotides , effectively controlling epigenetically manipulated gene expression . <br>
PMID21339759Line12 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> encodes the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 , a highly conserved histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase that influences stem cell renewal by epigenetic modification . <br>
PMID23619563Line13 In the European cohort , leukemia - free survival was negatively affected by <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations and in the Mayo cohort by <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22210327Line45 Do <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations have any clinical impact in AML ? <br>
PMID22035746Line7 JAK2V617F is the best characterized mutation in <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative neoplasms , with an estimated prevalence of more than 95 % in PV , 50 % in ET , and 50 % in PMF . <br>
PMID22898539Line80 Mutation of R882 occurred in nearly 60 % of the <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - mutant samples ( 37 of 62 mutations ) and has been shown to decrease catalytic activity and DNA binding affinity . <br>
PMID21714648Line125 Most patients with <font color="blue">EZH2</font> or <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations had low or intermediate - 1 risk according to the IPSS ( 86 % and 73 % , respectively ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line353 In the HOVON trial , the benefit in OS outcomes for the dose - escalated daunorubicin group was observed only in patients aged 65 years and younger or in those with <font color="blue">CBF</font> translocations . <br>
PMID21605981Line182 As previously mentioned , the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> knock - out mouse has profound defects in definitive hematopoiesis : <font color="blue">Gata2</font> - deficient embryos are anemic , have moderately reduced numbers of primitive erythroid cells and HPCs , and die at day 10 - 11 of gestation , demonstrating that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is essential in the earliest stages of hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID25465125Line78 Multivariable analysis , using <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , transfusion dependence , and risk parameter variables from the revised International Prognostic Scoring System ( R - IPSS ) , showed that presence of mutant <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , but not <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , was the single variable associated with inferior leukemia - free survival . <br>
PMID23896413Line64 The normal role of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> in promoting neutrophil production is biologically consistent with our observation of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> activating mutations in hematologic malignancies characterized by high levels of neutrophils . <br>
PMID22210327Line7 Mutations associated with CN - AML include those affecting <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , <font color="blue">FLT3</font> , <font color="blue">MLL</font> , <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> and other genes . <br>
PMID23978506Line26 Rare mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , and <font color="blue">CBL</font> have been described , although the precise roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of ET and PMF are unknown . <br>
PMID23619563Line61 As of their prognostic relevance in the European cohort ( see below ) , mutation analyses in the Mayo cohort were focused on <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ; the corresponding mutational frequencies were 31 % ( 85 out of 279 studied cases ) , 15 % ( 52 of 358 ) , 6 % ( 15 of 270 ) , 3 % ( 10 of 374 ) and 2 % ( 7 of 374 ) . <br>
PMID19282830Line110 C - terminal mutations of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> were detected in nine patients with CMML ; they would have been overlooked had the mutation analysis not included exons 7b and 8 of the <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> gene . <br>
PMID21714648Line137 <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations were not exclusive of abnormalities in other epigenetic regulators such as the chromatin - modifying genes <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> . <br>
PMID25006131Line116 Findings were similar for each individual mutation , with clonal expansion in 7 of 8 patients with <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutations ( P = . 05 ) , 2 of 4 <font color="blue">SMC3</font> mutant patients , as well as in the single patient with a <font color="blue">RAD21</font> mutation . <br>
PMID24335498Line148 We compared the allelic burden of mutations in the cohesin complex with the allelic burden of <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations , as the level of the allelic burden can indicate clonal hierarchy of different mutations . <br>
PMID23896413Line13 Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia ( aCML ) is an uncommon myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative ( MDS / MPN ) neoplasm , with a relative incidence estimated at 1 to 2 cases for every 100 patients with <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - positive chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line144 Indeed , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations were associated with worse survival in CMML and low - risk MDS , respectively . <br>
PMID21605981Line223 On the other hand , <font color="blue">GATA1</font> activates known erythroid and megakaryocyte specific genes and functions as a repressor of genes that mark the immature state of erythroid precursor cells , including <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and <font color="blue">KIT</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line249 Dawson et al showed that <font color="blue">JAK2</font> localizes to the nucleus and phosphorylates Y41 of histone H3 . <br>
PMID22898539Line13 Mutations and translocations involving <font color="blue">mixed - lineage leukaemia</font> ( <font color="blue">MLL</font> ) as well as mutations in Polycomb repressive complex ( PRC ) components and interacting proteins affect histone modifications and can promote myeloid transformation . <br>
PMID22878824Line124 Mutations in <font color="blue">IDH2</font> have been reported in 8 % to 12 % of patients with AML , with a frequency of 19 % reported among those with normal karyotype . <br>
PMID21714648Line71 No buccal sample was available for the sole patient with a mutation in <font color="blue">FLNB</font> ( R566Q ) , so this mutation could not be assumed to be somatic . <br>
PMID25006131Line103 Patients with <font color="blue">STAG2</font> / <font color="blue">RAD21</font> mutations were more likely to respond to treatment with HMAs compared with WT cases ( 79 % vs 47 % ; P = . 04 ) and were comparable in age and IPSS scores with the nonresponders . <br>
PMID25465125Line155 Recent studies have also demonstrated the independent prognostic value of <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> in CMML by disclosing the close associations between the mutation and higher white blood cell counts ( P = 0 . 03 ) , frequent extramedullary disease ( P = 0 . 03 ) , dismal OS ( hazard ratio = 2 . 23 , 95 % CI : 1 . 07 - 4 . 26 ) ( P = 0 . 028 ) , and AML - free survival ( hazard ratio = 2 . 05 , 95 % CI : 1 . 01 - 4 . 65 ) ( P = 0 . 049 ) . <br>
PMID21339759Line45 With respect to <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations , Sanger sequencing indicated a burden of ~ 50 % . <br>
PMID23054646Line70 In this assay , mutant transduced stem cells showed lower repopulating capacity compared to mock - or wild - type <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> - transduced cells , as determined by the chimerism in peripheral blood 6 weeks after transplantation , indicating that both <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutants could disturb normal hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID25006131Line90 <font color="blue">STAG2</font> was associated with higher - risk disease ( P = . 0023 ) , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> defects were most frequently identified in sAML ( 3 . 5 % and 4 % , respectively ; supplemental Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line191 <font color="blue">Notch1</font> and <font color="blue">Gata2</font> are coexpressed in endothelial cells lining the floor of the aorta at E10 . 5 , and <font color="blue">NOTCH1</font> binds the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> promoter and acts as an upstream regulator of <font color="blue">Gata2</font> expression during the onset of definitive hematopoiesis in the mouse embryo . <br>
PMID21605981Line216 <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> are essential for the development of the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages . <br>
PMID22323480Line27 Most <font color="blue">TSG</font> mutations are not canonical , though , making systematic clinical diagnostics more difficult . <br>
PMID21339759Line33 Of note , thus far , we sequenced 463 cases of various myeloid malignancies and detected the corresponding putative <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutation 1900 _ 1922del ( Glu635ArgfsX16 ) in 21 patients overall ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line78 <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID21605981Line239 Therefore , in vivo experiments indicate that the hematopoietic GATA factors are functionally redundant with regard to erythropoiesis , while the <font color="blue">GATA1</font> protein exerts a unique function in megakaryopoiesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line148 They hypothesized that the <font color="blue">FOG1</font> antagonist activity in this process could be to some extend caused by a ' GATA switch ' at the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus . <br>
PMID22323480Line108 In low - risk MDS , mutations of any 1 of these 3 genes were found in 39 % of patients , and further analysis found that mutations in <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> were highly associated with RARS . <br>
PMID23978506Line219 All of these were found to have low <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F allele burden when tested by quantitative assays . <br>
PMID24335498Line62 The somatic or germline status of mutations in genes of the cohesin complex was established by evaluating remission samples or T cells ( CD3 + <font color="blue">CD11b</font> - <font color="blue">CD14</font> - CD3 + ) purified from diagnostic samples by flow <br>
PMID22878824Line102 The median OS among patients with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD in the absence of a wild - type <font color="blue">FLT3</font> was only 7 months compared with 46 months among both the patient subgroups with wild - type <font color="blue">FLT3</font> with or without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD . <br>
PMID25465125Line111 In CMML , recent data suggest that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> is a negative prognostic factor , with shorter OS , particularly in the CMML II subtype . <br>
PMID24986690Line147 As illustrated in Figures 4 - 5 , the prognosis of a triple - negative patient is markedly worse than that of a <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patient : in these cases , therapeutic decisions may span from a watchful waiting strategy to allogeneic stem cell transplantation . <br>
PMID23978506Line80 After secondary causes of polycythemia have been ruled out , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> analysis ( first for exon 14 V617F , and then , if findings are negative , for exon 12 ) is indicated to support the diagnosis of PV . <br>
PMID19282830Line124 Thirteen patients ( nos . 10 - 13 and 17 - 25 ) carrying N - terminal mutants resulting in frameshift and / or truncation of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> proteins in the middle of the RHD are expected to lose the ability of the RHD to bind to DNA sequences and lack transcriptional activities . <br>

PMID20601954Line48 The cohort harboring <font color="blue">EZH2</font> aberrations was too small to detect a clear association with a specific French - American - British , International Prognostic Scoring System or World Health Organization classification of MDS ( Table 1 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line108 Although <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations are sufficient to induce an MDS / MPN murine phenotype , a concomitant <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutation accelerates this phenotype and leads to progressive disease . <br>

PMID25465125Line255 It has been postulated that <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutations and resultant resultant depletion of cohesin may increase <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> expression , forming the basis of leukemogenesis in these patients . <br>

PMID21605981Line251 As summarized in this review , only a few direct <font color="blue">GATA2</font> target genes have been described , the most prominent of these being <font color="blue">GATA2</font> itself . <br>

PMID21605981Line125 Unlike the <font color="blue">FOG1</font> / <font color="blue">GATA1</font> binding , these molecular interactions are still not fully understood . <br>
PMID22210327Line38 Because a relatively small number of CN - AML cases has been analyzed for <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations and cases of s - AML have not been investigated for <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mutations , it is not yet clear whether or not mutations of these two homologous genes may occur in the same clinical - genetic AML backgrounds . <br>
PMID21714648Line136 Furthermore , analysis of the mutant - allele burden in samples with mutations of <font color="blue">TET2</font> and other genes showed that <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations are not always present at the greatest frequency , which would be expected if they were exclusively involved in early pathogenic events ( Fig . 7 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line98 Our results are also different from McGlynn study and Padua study of RAS , <font color="blue">FMS</font> , and p53 , in which the loss of <font color="blue">FMS</font> gene , mutation of RAS , <font color="blue">FMS</font> , and p53 were common in AML and myelodysplasias . <br>
PMID22210327Line36 Mutations of <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mainly clustered with CN - AML , were virtually mutually exclusive with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> and <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD mutations and showed an association with <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID21714648Line14 Mutations in <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">TP53</font> , and <font color="blue">NRAS</font> were most strongly associated with severe thrombocytopenia ( P < 0 . 001 for all comparisons ) and an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts ( P < 0 . 006 for all comparisons ) . <br>

PMID19282830Line135 Collaboration of other genetic or epigenetic alterations in the great majority of patients with CMML and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations , especially at AML transformation , requires further investigation . <br>
PMID21605981Line105 During erythroid differentiation , expression of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> is upregulated and <font color="blue">GATA1</font> replaces <font color="blue">GATA2</font> at the same motifs , resulting in the inhibition of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> transcription . <br>
PMID21605981Line235 One complicating issue is that the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> protein is much less stable than <font color="blue">GATA1</font> , raising questions about the relevance of mRNA levels . <br>
PMID25006131Line98 When stratifying by normal / abnormal karyotype , no particular genetic lesion was enriched based on karyotype , although 5 out of 9 patients ( 55 % ) with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations and abnormal karyotype had trisomy 8 . <br>
PMID21605981Line56 Thus , transcription of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mRNAs is initiated from two first exons : the distal first exon of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> ( IS exon ) is specific of hematopoietic and neuronal cells , whereas the proximal first exon ( IG exon ) is utilized in all tissues that express <font color="blue">GATA2</font> ( Fig . 1 ) . <br>

PMID21605981Line89 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> transcription is regulated by several transcription factors such as <font color="blue">ETS1</font> , <font color="blue">BMP4</font> , <font color="blue">NOTCH1</font> , <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> and <font color="blue">EVI1</font> , and by the cytokines <font color="blue">IL - 1</font> and <font color="blue">TNFalpha</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line28 <font color="blue">GATA1</font> is present in the more differentiated cells of the erythroid , megakaryocytic , eosinophilic and mast lineages , and is an essential transcription factor for the maturation of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells . <br>
PMID21605981Line305 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is expressed in adult endothelial cells , where it plays key roles in the transcriptional regulation of endothelial - specific genes containing GATA - binding sites in their promoter regions : <font color="blue">eNOS</font> , <font color="blue">von Willebrand factor</font> , <font color="blue">KDR</font> and PECAM . <br>
PMID21714648Line31 The interaction between the <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutations and the genes more recently reported to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes have not been studied in a large enough number of patients to establish their independent prognostic significance . <br>
PMID22878824Line143 Another recent study also showed that in younger patients ( age < 60 years ) with NK - AML , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutation was associated with significantly decreased DFS ( 3 - year rate , 20 % vs . 49 % ; P = . 007 ) and a trend toward decreased OS . <br>
PMID22323480Line168 This splicing abnormality of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> is also observed in cases with <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations but not in <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutants . <br>
PMID23223431Line114 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations are identified in chronic neutropenia . <br>
PMID22898539Line108 Careful analysis of the methylome in HSCs revealed that deletion of <font color="blue">Dnmt3a</font> resulted in both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of different loci ; notably , they observed hypomethylation and increased expression of a core set of genes that are crucial for regulating HSC self - renewal and promoting malignancy . <br>
PMID22210327Line22 In AML , the <font color="blue">BCOR</font> gene is targeted by both translocations and mutations . <br>
PMID21605981Line254 Furthermore , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> directly upregulates <font color="blue">BMP4</font> expression , binding to the regulatory elements present at the <font color="blue">BMP4</font> promoter . <br>
PMID22323480Line131 At both the 3 ' and 5 ' splice sites of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> intron 6 , unspliced reads were more frequent than spliced reads ( Figure 3B ) . <br>

PMID25465125Line92 A recent in vitro study showed that loss of <font color="blue">BAP1</font> , a tumor suppressor gene , is linked to myeloid neoplasm by loss of interacting with the polycomb group proteins <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">ASXL2</font> , as well as host cell factor - 1 and O - linked N - acetylglucosamine transferase , which could provide an alternative mechanism in dysregulation of epigenesis . <br>

PMID21605981Line276 The biological functions of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in hematopoiesis and the importance of its balanced expression led to the suggestion that it might be involved in leukemogenesis . <br>
PMID21339759Line13 As reported by Ernst et al <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations were identified in 13 % of CMML patients and myelodysplastic / myeloproliferative neoplasm patients mutated in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> had been associated with an inferior outcome ( P = 0 . 0006 ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line66 Also in the Mayo cohort <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations were more enriched in the DIPSS - plus high - risk category ( 45 % , P = 0 . 0002 and 22 % , P = 0 . 004 , respectively ) , with no difference for <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations . <br>
PMID23896413Line46 Notwithstanding case reports of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F positivity in selected cases of CNL and aCML , no other recurrent genetic mutations had been identified in these diseases until the recent discoveries of mutant <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> and <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> . <br>
PMID23896413Line50 We recently reported that ~ 50 % to 60 % of patients with CNL or aCML harbor mutations in the receptor for colony - stimulating factor 3 ( <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ; <font color="blue">GCSFR</font> ) . <br>

PMID24986690Line101 Within " lower - risk " subjects ( Figure 5A ) , <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had a better OS compared with either <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) - mutant ( P = . 011 ) or triple - negative patients ( P < . 001 ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line124 Due to the strong association between <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations and mutations in the cohesin complex , we studied the impact of cohesin mutations on OS and RFS in <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - mutated AML patients separately . <br>
PMID23978506Line5 Recurrent mutations in <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> genes are genetic hallmarks of <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative myeloproliferative neoplasms . <br>
PMID23978506Line133 With quantitative assessment , it has been reported that approximately 20 % to 30 % of PV patients have less than 25 % <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F alleles . <br>
PMID23054646Line44 Malcovati et al reported that regardless of disease type , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations strongly predicted the presence of increased sideroblasts with 97 . 7 % positive predictive value , although it did not necessarily satisfy the criteria for RARS or RCMD - RS ( i . e . , 15 % of all erythroblasts ) . <br>
PMID25006131Line130 Notably , expression of the entire cohesin complex was reduced in patients with <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutations in a manner similar to that seen in patients with reduced cohesin expression in the absence of mutations ( Figure 6B ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line192 A recent study provided evidence of mutated <font color="blue">CBL</font> in enhancement of resistance to apoptosis in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia via <font color="blue">Src</font> family kinase lyn - PI3K / <font color="blue">AKT</font> pathway , suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy by using a <font color="blue">Lyn</font> - PI3K / <font color="blue">AKT</font> inhibitor to treat the chemoresistant <font color="blue">CBL</font> - mutant juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia or assumedly in <font color="blue">CBL</font> - mutated MDS . <br>
PMID22898539Line193 The <font color="blue">EZH2</font> homologue <font color="blue">EZH1</font> also has similar enzymatic activity , and the redundancy of these two proteins in controlling PRC2 functionality probably differs according to cellular context . <br>
PMID23223431Line22 Germline heterozygous mutations of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> occur mostly in the <font color="blue">Rel</font> homology domain , leading to the loss of its DNA - binding capacity and being associated with a familial platelet disorder and an autosomaldominant transmission . <br>
PMID19282830Line14 This study showed for the first time a high frequency of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in CMML . <br>
PMID23978506Line118 In principle , the presence of additional exon 14 mutations can interfere with binding of primers and probes in allele - specific assays , but such mutations are exceptionally rare ( < 1 % of all <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line150 Recent studies found <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations in up to 9 % of all MDS / MPN patients , with especially high frequency ( 24 - 31 . 7 % ) in atypical CML . <br>
PMID22035746Line53 <font color="blue">MPL</font> was identified as a candidate for MPN pathogenesis when it was described in the downstream signaling pathway required for JAK2V617F - mediated transformation of myeloprogenitor cells . <br>
PMID23978506Line122 Blood versus Bone Marrow Initial testing of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations is most commonly performed on peripheral blood samples . <br>
PMID25006131Line55 The mean coverage for cohesin genes ( <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> ) is 265X for the deepsequencing samples . <br>

PMID21605981Line169 There are few studies about the role of miRNAs in <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>
PMID23531518Line46 PCR amplification conditions were the same for both <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> reactions and included a primary denaturation of 95 - - Degree - - C for 2 min , followed by 35 cycles of : 95 - - Degree - - C for 30 s , 57 - - Degree - - C for 45 s and 72 - - Degree - - C for 45 s , and ended with a final extension of 72 - - Degree - - C for 5 min . <br>
PMID22323480Line109 Among patients with MDS / MPN , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were not common in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) , but they were frequent in patients with RARS - T ; thus , the presence of RS was found to correlate highly with <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations , irrespective of other clinical or morphologic features ( Figure 2A ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line222 It is also known that the pro - inflammatory cytokines <font color="blue">IL - 1</font> and <font color="blue">TNFalpha</font> activate <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , leading to the inhibition of erythroid differentiation in human erythropoietin - dependent cells . <br>

PMID21605981Line280 Zhang et al described two <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis . <br>
PMID21339759Line56 The investigations revealed no further significant associations , with the exception of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> - mutated versus <font color="blue">EZH2</font> wild - type cases ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line153 The oncogenic role of mutant JAK2V617F tyrosine kinase in patients with <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPN has not been fully established . <br>
PMID21339759Line43 In median , the burden of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations was 45 % of bidirectional sequencing reads ( range : 1 . 4 - 88 % ) per patient . <br>
PMID21605981Line245 When <font color="blue">GATA1</font> is reestablished , <font color="blue">GATA1</font> replaces <font color="blue">GATA2</font> at the <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> locus , and <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> expression is extinguished . <br>
PMID25006131Line119 Analysis for mutational burden after therapy demonstrated the <font color="blue">STAG2</font> and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> mutant clones in 2 cases were undetectable and the third case had persistence of a small <font color="blue">RAD21</font> clone ( 44 % to 7 % ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line302 Taken together , our results indicate that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression could be a useful molecular marker for predicting clinical outcome in AML , and would support the association between <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and both <font color="blue">WT1</font> and <font color="blue">EVI1</font> previously reported . <br>
PMID21605981Line221 Imagawa et al demonstrated that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> inhibits EPO transcription by binding to its promoter under normoxic conditions . <br>
PMID22210327Line41 The observation that about half the <font color="blue">BCOR</font> - mutated cases also carry mutations of the <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> gene suggests that these two mutations may act synergistically to induce AML , possibly interfering with epigenetic mechanisms . <br>
PMID10706759Line62 The first PCR products were 1476 bp in length , and the length of nested PCR products was 1344 bp . Of the 62 AML specimens analyzed , 15 ( 24 % ) revealed the occurrence of aberrant <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> transcripts ; a normalsized band was present in all specimens ( Fig . 1A ) . <br>

PMID24335498Line106 Of 5 <font color="blue">STAG2</font> and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> mutated patients , 3 carried a mutation in <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , respectively . <br>
PMID23054646Line82 Fig . 1 . After the recognition of the 50 splice site by U1 snRNP complex , a protein complex consisting of a U2AF heterodimer , <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF1</font> / 2 was recruited to the 30 splice boundary , where the smaller subunit ( <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> ) of the U2AF heterodimer binds to the AG - dinucleotide , while the larger subunits recognize a polypyrimidine tract . <font color="blue">SRSF1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> belong to a SR family of proteins , having one or more Serine - Arginine - rich domains , and bind to splicing enhancer sequences and also interact with other proteins through its SR domain . To the 50 upstream of the polypyrimidine tract lies a branchpoint sequence , to which another splicing factor , <font color="blue">SF - 1</font> , binds and together with the U2AF heterodimer and other components , participates in the establishment of the splicing E complex . Once the splicing E complex is established , a U2 snRNP complex replaces <font color="blue">SF - 1</font> to generate the splicing A complex . Prominently , all the major components of these splicing complex are targets of gene mutations in MDS . <br>

PMID21605981Line161 In fact , mutation of a subset of lysine residues causes a severe loss of the transactivation potential of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> protein . <br>
PMID23619563Line78 As <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations predicted overall survival , while <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> predicted leukemic transformation , all independent of each other , we considered the four mutations ( <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 ) as being detrimental for disease outcome , in general , and accordingly classified the European patients into those who displayed at least one ( ' mutationally high - risk ' ) or none ( ' mutationally low - risk ' ) of the four mutations . <br>

PMID22898539Line221 Despite the importance of <font color="blue">BMI1</font> in the regulation of stem cell self - renewal , recurrent somatic mutations in <font color="blue">PRC1</font> members have not been described thus far in haematopoietic malignancies . <br>
PMID22878824Line115 Mutations in <font color="blue">IDH1</font> have been reported in 6 % to 9 % of AML cases , with a higher frequency reported among patients with NK - AML ( 8 % - 16 % ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line127 This pathway leads to the conversion of 5 - hmC to 5 - hydroxymethyluracil ( 5 - hmU ) , which activates the base - excision repair ( BER ) pathway that uses the thymine DNA glycosylase ( TDG ) or the single - strand - selective monofunctional <font color="blue">uracil DNA glycosylase</font> ( <font color="blue">SMUG1</font> ) to generate unmethylated cytosines . <br>

Gene coloring is based on normalized signals , as shown at the bottom of the figure ; green indicates reduced expression , red increased expression . Gene symbol is indicated on the left . Low - risk and high - risk groups clustered separately in the dendrogram shown at the top of the heat map . <br>

PMID23896413Line53 The most common <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation in CNL / aCML is the membrane proximal mutation : T618I . <br>
PMID22898539Line89 Mutations in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> have also been observed in patients with MDS , as well as less commonly in patients with classic MPNs ( BOX 1 ; TABLE 1 ) . <br>
PMID21714648Line126 The presence ( vs . the absence ) of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations was strongly associated with decreased overall survival in the stepwise , multi - variable model that considered age , sex , IPSS risk group , and the presence of other mutations ( hazard ratio for death , 2 . 13 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 36 to 3 . 33 ] ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line124 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations have been found at a much higher frequency ( 23 . 6 % ) in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts ( RAEB ) , RAEB in transformation ( RAEB - T ) , and AML following MDS with relative low blast count , suggesting that it is associated with a high - risk phenotype . <br>
PMID21605981Line116 This interaction is given through a specific motif located at the <font color="blue">FOG1</font> N - terminus , providing a mechanism for <font color="blue">GATA1</font> - dependent gene repression . <br>

PMID20601954Line47 This is notable , as both <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and the TET family of proteins have been implicated in epigenetic regulation of gene transcription . <br>
PMID25465125Line72 The incidence of combined <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 mutations in MDS is variable , ranging from 2 . 2 % to 12 % . <br>
PMID21605981Line284 However , these <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations have not been detected in acute myeloid leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , acute lymphoid leukemia or chronic lymphoid leukemia patients . <br>
PMID23978506Line108 There are no standard methods for detecting the rare <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations , nor for <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line163 The limited studies to date of IDH - mutant AML cells suggest that <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R172 mutations result in a higher level of 2 - HG than <font color="blue">IDH1</font> - R132 mutations . <br>
PMID22323480Line102 All <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were located in exon 14 or 15 , with the K700 mutation being the most recurrent ( Figure 1B ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line190 Because mutant <font color="blue">CBL</font> lacks E3 ubiquitin ligase activity , the protein is unable to act as a negative regulator to attenuate signaling function . <br>

PMID23619563Line59 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations were more frequent in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> - ( 11 % versus 3 % ; P < 0 . 002 ) , <font color="blue">TET2</font> - ( 11 % versus 4 % ; P = 0 . 043 ) , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - ( 11 % versus 2 % ; P = 0 . 022 ) , <font color="blue">CBL</font> - ( 11 % versus 2 % ; P < 0 . 001 ) and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> - ( 13 . 5 % versus 7 % ; P = 0 . 035 ) mutated patients . <br>

PMID23619563Line111 As was the case in the current study , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations have previously been associated with poor outcome in MDS and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> in distinct subtypes of AML . <br>
PMID21605981Line31 <font color="blue">GATA3</font> essentially contributes to the development of T lymphocytes . <br>
PMID22898539Line112 Recent studies demonstrated the TET proteins ( <font color="blue">TET1</font> - 3 ) are Fe ( II ) - and alpha - ketoglutarate - dependent enzymes that catalyse the conversion of 5 - mC to 5 - hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5 - hmC ) in DNA24 ( FIG . 1 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line52 These mutations fall into 2 classes : nonsense or frameshift mutations that lead to premature truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor ( truncation mutations ) and point mutations in the extracellular domain of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ( membrane proximal mutations ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line32 Another conspicuous feature of splicing factor mutations is the presence of mutational hot spots in major mutational targets , including <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line10 Mutated allele frequencies were similar between <font color="blue">NPM1</font> and cohesin gene mutations . Overall survival ( OS ) , relapse - free survival ( RFS ) , and complete remission rates ( CR ) were not influenced by the presence of cohesin mutations ( OS : hazard ratio [ HR ] 0 . 98 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0 . 56 - 1 . 72 [ P = . 94 ] ; RFS : HR 0 . 7 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 36 - 1 . 38 [ P = . 3 ] ; CR : mutated 83 % vs wild - type 76 % [ P = . 45 ] ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line190 It is important to note that the development of HSCs from the hemogenic endothelium is a <font color="blue">NOTCH1</font> - regulated event and is impaired in <font color="blue">NOTCH1</font> deficient mouse embryos [ 125 ] . <br>
PMID22898539Line214 More recently , mutational profiling of a large cohort of patients with MDS reported that mutations in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> were associated with worsened overall survival , independent of known clinical predictors of worsened survival in MDS such as the International Prognostic Scoring System ( TABLE 1 ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line63 The only described disease phenotype associated with <font color="blue">TET2</font> in MPN is older age . <br>
PMID24986690Line62 <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients were significantly younger , had lower leukocyte count , higher platelet count , and lower IPSS risk . <br>
PMID24335498Line9 We found a strong association between mutations affecting the cohesin complex and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line104 Early studies also suggest that HOXB genes may also be important targets of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , and the methylation of HOXB genes is altered in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - mutant AML cells . <br>

PMID21605981Line201 <font color="blue">EVI1</font> is predominantly expressed in HSCs , suggesting a physiological role for this protein in these cells . <br>
PMID22898539Line256 For example , it is unclear how <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( or <font color="blue">JAK1</font> ( REF . 95 ) ) enters the nucleus , as the JAKs do not contain known nuclear - localization sequences . <br>

PMID19282830Line108 Earlier studies of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in CMML were carried out by the PCR - single - strand conformational polymorphism approach , and mainly focused on RHD ( exons 3 - - 5 ) . <br>
PMID19282830Line125 Five mutants ( nos . 26 - - 30 ) with frameshift mutations located in exons 7b or 8 producing stop codons downstream of the normal termination codon 453 are expected to retain the DNA - binding potential but to lose transactivation ability , and to act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild - type <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , as described by Harada et al . <br>
PMID20601954Line28 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> missense , donor - splice - site and frameshift mutations predicting truncated proteins were observed in 8 out of 126 subjects ( 6 % ; Table 1 and Fig . 1b ) . <br>

PMID22323480Line142 Serial studies performed on patients from the initial diagnosis of low - risk MDS through subsequent transformation indicate that <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations may represent early ancestral events . <br>
PMID23223431Line112 We investigated its origin using 4 highly polymorphic short tandem repeats , 2 centromeric to <font color="blue">GATA2</font> ( D3S3606 and D3S3607 ) and 2 telomeric to <font color="blue">GATA2</font> ( D3S1587 and D3S1292 ) . <br>

PMID22898539Line149 The differences in phenotypes described among these reports may be attributable to the different approaches used to target <font color="blue">Tet2</font> . <br>
PMID22878824Line162 Although data are emerging on the prognostic relevance of mutations in the IDH and <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> genes ( see earlier discussions ) , the role of these molecular lesions on the risk stratification of patients with AML remains to be defined . <br>
PMID24335498Line84 Additionally , we identified 4 patients with mutations in <font color="blue">RAD21</font> and 2 patients with mutations in <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> ( Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line101 Interestingly , a study in patients with NK - AML showed that prognosis was worse among patients with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD without a wild - type <font color="blue">FLT3</font> , compared with those with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD but having a wild - type <font color="blue">FLT3</font> in the second allele . <br>
PMID21605981Line316 On the other hand , the implication of the impaired function of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in solid tumors has only been studied in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and neuroblastoma . <br>
PMID22210327Line12 However , the strategies leading to the discovery of <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations in AML differed . <br>
PMID19282830Line106 Harada et al . did not find <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in four patients with CMML , nor did Preudhomme et al . in 27 CMML patients . <br>
PMID22035746Line51 Disease phenotypes associated with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> exon 12 mutations include younger age at diagnosis , subnormal <font color="blue">erythropoietin</font> ( EPO ) levels , and isolated erythrocytosis at clinical onset . <br>
PMID25465125Line138 An <font color="blue">ETV6</font> gene rearrangement is associated with a good prognosis in a subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t ( 11 ; 22 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line98 The presence of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations has also been independently associated with an inferior OS in low - and high - risk MDS patients . <br>
PMID22898539Line302 Figure 2 . The role of mutations and aberrant expression of chromatin modifiers in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies . In the hierarchical recruitment model , transcriptional silencing begins with the recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) and the induction of <font color="blue">enhancer of zeste homologue 2</font> ( <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ) - mediated dimethylation ( me2 ) and trimethylation ( me3 ) of lysine 27 of histone H3 ( H3K27 ) . <font color="blue">PRC1</font> recognizes H3K27me3 through the chromodomain of Polycomb ( PC ) homologues . <font color="blue">PRC1</font> - mediated ubiquitylation ( Ub ) of lysine 119 of histone H2A ( H2AK119 ) follows , leading to chromatin compaction and the recruitment by PRC2 of DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs ) to target - gene loci . Currently , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> is known to be affected by loss - of - function mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs ) , and MDS / MPN overlap disorders . Other PRC2 members are less commonly affected by loss - of - function mutations and copy - number loss , including <font color="blue">suppressor of zeste 12 homologue</font> ( <font color="blue">SUZ12</font> ) , <font color="blue">embryonic ectoderm development</font> ( <font color="blue">EED</font> ) and <font color="blue">JARID2</font> . Overexpression of a <font color="blue">PRC1</font> component , <font color="blue">BMI1</font> , is known to result in increased haematopoietic stem cell self - renewal from mouse studies , but <font color="blue">BMI1</font> overexpression is not known to be a recurrent alteration in human myeloid malignancy . <font color="blue">PRC1</font> activity recruits DNMTs , including <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , which is known to be affected by suspected loss - of - function mutations in all types of human myeloid malignancies . Removal of H2AK119 ubiquitylation in Drosophila melanogaster and in mammalian cells in vitro occurs by the Polycomb - repressive deubiquitylase ( PR - DUB ) complex , which consists of calypso ( the D . melanogaster orthologue of <font color="blue">BRCA1 - associated protein 1</font> ( <font color="blue">BAP1</font> ) ) and addition of sex combs - like 1 ( <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ) . However , the presence of this PR - DUB has not been demonstrated in mammalian cells in vivo , and more recent data in mammalian myeloid leukaemia cells suggest that <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> expression is strongly correlated with an abundance of H3K27me3 in addition to physically interacting with PRC2 . Mixed - lineage leukaemia ( <font color="blue">MLL</font> ) is a member of a multiprotein complex that mediates methylation of H3K4 within the promoter region of genes through its SET domain . <font color="blue">MLL</font> is known to be affected by mutations that result in a partial tandem - duplication ( PTD ) and by translocations that result in in - frame fusions of the amino - terminus of <font color="blue">MLL</font> to one of > 50 different partners and loss of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET domain . <font color="blue">MLL</font> - PTD has been shown to result in increased levels of H3K4me3 , whereas translocated <font color="blue">MLL</font> recruits the H3K79 methyltransferase <font color="blue">DOT1L</font> . The multiple physical associations that <font color="blue">MLL</font> requires for its function has led to the development of various therapeutic approaches to abrogate the activity of mutant <font color="blue">MLL</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line93 Four patients were identified with missense mutations in <font color="blue">SMC3</font> and 1 patient with the stop codon being changed to leucine ( Figure 1 and supplemental Table 4 ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line165 A complete review of other <font color="blue">JAK2</font> inhibitors is discussed elsewhere . <br>
PMID22878824Line128 Similar to findings with <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations , reports on the prognostic effect of <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations have also been inconsistent . <br>
PMID25006131Line76 After excluding all known single - nucleotide polymorphisms and filtering out alterations present in paired germline samples , somatic alterations in cohesin complex genes were identified in 11 . 6 % of patients , including <font color="blue">STAG2</font> ( 5 . 9 % ) , <font color="blue">RAD21</font> ( 2 % ) , and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> ( 2 % ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line251 More recently , mutant <font color="blue">JAK2</font> was shown to phosphorylate <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> , an arginine methyltransferase , much more effectively than wild - type <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( REF . 94 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line99 Numerous studies have shown the negative prognostic influence of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD in patients with AML , resulting in shorter remission durations ( eg , decreased diseasefree survival [ DFS ] in patients with a CR ) and poorer survival outcomes compared with patients with wild - type <font color="blue">FLT3</font> . <br>
PMID23223431Line155 We identified a heterozygous nonsense <font color="blue">GATA2</font> E224X mutation ( c . 670G > T , supplemental Figure 1 ) that was not detected in the parents ' samples . <br>
PMID21339759Line38 Two of the nine affected patients concomitantly harbored two different <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations , however , these were located on two separate amplicons not allowing to discriminate between a monoor biallelic state . <br>
PMID23978506Line19 The 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic neoplasms includes <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations as diagnostic criteria in PV and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations in ET and PMF . <br>
PMID25465125Line51 The prognostic relevance of the molecular consequence associated with <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutation has also been investigated in MDS . <br>
PMID21605981Line103 At this point , we will examine the switching profile that <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> shows during erythroid cell differentiation . <br>
PMID25465125Line57 Recurrent <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations have been identified in de novo AML ( 62 of 281 patients , 22 . 1 % ) and have been associated with an intermediate - risk cytogenetic profile . <br>
PMID21605981Line207 Interestingly , it has been recently reported that acetylation of <font color="blue">EVI1</font> at Lys564 by <font color="blue">P / CAF</font> enhances the DNA - binding capacity of <font color="blue">EVI1</font> and thereby contributes to the transcriptional activation of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>
PMID23531518Line30 Thus far , in CMML , loss - of - function gene mutations involving <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> has been associated with poor outcome . <br>
PMID23619563Line91 Considering the prognostic relevance of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations for survival and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations for leukemia - free survival , the Mayo cohort was divided into mutationally high ( <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> or <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutated ) and mutationally low ( none of the above ) risk categories , which showed significant difference in both overall ( multivariable HR accounting for DIPSS - plus : 1 . 4 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 - 1 . 9 ; P = 0 . 04 ) and leukemia - free ( multivariable HR accounting for karyotype and thrombocytopenia : 3 . 2 , 95 % CI : 1 . 6 - 6 . 4 ; P = 0 . 001 ) survival . <br>

Schematic representation of the <font color="blue">BCOR</font> ( top ) and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> ( bottom ) transcriptional corepressors with their respective domains and the location and type of mutations occurring in AML patients . The numbers above the arrows indicate the presence , in more than one case , of the same type of mutation occurring at the same exonic location or involving the splicing of the same intron . <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations also include five mutations that were found in four AML cell lines and in the Jurkat T - lymphoblastic leukemia cell line . The specific type ( i . e . frameshift , nonsense , missense or splice - site ) of <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations was inferred from Li et al . <br>
PMID23978506Line134 Insensitive molecular assays would cause an even bigger problem in ET , in which up to 75 % of cases have a <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F level of less than 25 % and a considerable number ( 40 % of cases ) have a <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F level of less than 10 % . <br>
PMID21714648Line118 By analyzing copy - number alterations with the use of SNP arrays and oncogene mutations , by means of high - throughput genotyping , we identified new mutations in <font color="blue">ETV6</font> and <font color="blue">GNAS</font> . <br>
PMID22878824Line105 In the latter study from the UK MRC , the 5 - year OS rate among patients with and without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations was 53 % versus 37 % , respectively . <br>
PMID25465125Line63 Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 genes ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 ) encode isocitrate dehydrogenases ( IDHs ) , which catalyze the NADP + - dependent decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha - hetoglutarate ( alpha - KG ) or 2 - oxoglutarate ( 2OG ) , a key intermediate and an essential cofactor for a number of enzymes in the Kreb cycle ( the tricarboxylic acid cycle ) , leading to the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADP ) . <br>
PMID21714648Line69 We identified and validated mutations in 10 genes : <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> , <font color="blue">BRAF</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">GNAS</font> , <font color="blue">FLNB</font> , <font color="blue">MET</font> , <font color="blue">EGFR</font> , <font color="blue">CDH1</font> , and <font color="blue">PTPN11</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line262 Notably , PRC2 associates only with the fusion oncoprotein and not with endogenous <font color="blue">PML</font> or RARalpha . <br>
PMID20601954Line41 Although we could readily detect <font color="blue">EZH2</font> protein in cell lines and in primary T cells , no <font color="blue">EZH2</font> protein expression could be measured in the total bone marrow of individuals with MDS irrespective of the presence or absence of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line79 Notably , the majority of somatic <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations result either in premature truncation of the protein product ( nonsense or frameshift mutations ) , or occur at a single amino acid , R882 . <br>
PMID23896413Line81 <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> protects <font color="blue">SET</font> from protease cleavage , thus increasing the amount of <font color="blue">SET</font> available to repress the activity of <font color="blue">PP2A</font> . <br>
PMID22878824Line324 The panel strongly recommends clinical trials as standard therapy for patients with poor prognostic features , which include <font color="blue">FLT3</font> abnormalities in the setting of otherwise normal karyotype , high WBC ( > 50 , 000 / mcL ) at diagnosis , or 2 cycles of induction therapy needed to achieve CR . <br>
PMID22898539Line77 They found that <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations were present in 22 % of adult cases of AML and were associated with an increased risk of relapse in a single - institution patient cohort ( TABLE 1 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line80 As indicated above , the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> gene harbors two alternative untranslated first exons . <br>
PMID21714648Line132 <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations were the most prevalent genetic abnormality identified in our sample set . <br>
PMID19282830Line12 There was no difference in overall survival between patients with and without <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations , but a trend of higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) progression was observed in mutation - positive patients ( 16 / 30 vs 17 / 51 , P = 0 . 102 ) , especially in patients with C - terminal mutations ( P = 0 . 023 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line219 Numerous studies have identified <font color="blue">BMI1</font> , a core member of the <font color="blue">PRC1</font> complex that is crucial for its H2AK119 ubiquitin ligase activity ( FIG . 2 ) , as an important regulator of both HSC and leukaemia stem cell ( LSC ) self - renewal . <br>
PMID19282830Line9 Thirty - two <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations were detected in 30 patients ( 37 % ) ; 23 mutants were located in the N - terminal part and 9 in the C - terminal region . <br>
PMID23223431Line17 The rate of evolution of patients with severe congenital neutropenia is 10 . 8 % at 20 years increasing to 18 . 8 % in patients with <font color="blue">SBDS</font> mutations . <br>
PMID19282830Line85 Taken together , 16 . 7 % ( 5 / 30 ) of CMML patients carrying <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations had cooperating mutations of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> or RAS genes . <br>
PMID21605981Line178 These observations led to the notion that a key function of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is to maintain the proliferative progenitor - cell phenotype , and that its downregulation is necessary for differentiation . <br>
PMID24335498Line120 <font color="blue">STAG1</font> , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> mutations had no influence on OS and RFS , whereas the analysis was not performed for <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> due to the low mutation frequency ( Table 2 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line125 The presence of <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations was mutually exclusive with <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutation in nearly all cases . <br>
PMID25465125Line59 In MDS , the rate of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations appears to be lower , in the range of 2 - 8 % . <br>
PMID23223431Line46 We selected for <font color="blue">GATA2</font> by screening 14 probands from a series of 544 patients included in the registry . <br>
PMID21605981Line34 The other GATA family members , <font color="blue">GATA4</font> , <font color="blue">GATA5</font> and <font color="blue">GATA6</font> , are mainly expressed in tissues of mesodermal and endodermal origin such as the heart , liver , lung , gut , and gonads , where they play critical roles in regulating tissue - specific gene expression . <br>

PMID22878824Line123 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutation was also associated with worse EFS and OS outcomes among the subgroup of patients with intermediate - risk NK - AML ( wild - type <font color="blue">NPM1</font> without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line227 Moreover , it is known that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression in hematopoietic cell lines induces megakaryocytic differentiation ( Fig . 4B ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line317 It has been recently reported that high <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression is a common event in patients with prostate cancer ( 83 . 7 % ) , and can influence the regulation of androgen - dependent genes , such as <font color="blue">KLK2</font> and <font color="blue">AZGP1</font> . <br>

PMID20601954Line25 Because large segmental regions of UPD may harbor acquired homozygous mutations , we sequenced <font color="blue">EZH2</font> in the bone marrow cells of the two subjects who showed UPD at 7q ( Fig . 1a ; subjects 97 and 103 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line321 In contrast , patients with an isolated <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD mutation and normal karyotype have an outlook similar to those with poor - risk cytogenetics and should be considered for a clinical trial or early allogeneic HSCT . <br>
PMID25465125Line117 <font color="blue">UTX</font> mutations have been identified in a variety of cancers , including some hematopoietic cell lines of myeloid origin , e . g . , CMML ( 8 % ) , but have been seldom found in MDS ( 1 % ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line36 Gene expression profiling was performed on total cellular RNA isolated from <font color="blue">CD34</font> + cells of a subset of patients from the European cohort , randomly selected among those defined at ' mutationally high - risk ' or ' mutationally low - risk ' as described in Supplementary Methods . <br>

PMID25465125Line214 Nearly all <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations are located in exon 14 or 15 , most commonly at K700E . <br>
PMID22878824Line133 These results seem to suggest that in patients with NK - AML without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations confer a survival benefit only in the presence of concurrent IDH mutations . <br>
PMID19282830Line20 Fusion genes involving the <font color="blue">PDGFb</font> receptor gene at 5q33 are characterized by a distinct phenotype of CMML - eos . <br>
PMID23531518Line72 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations were detected in 87 ( 49 % ) out of 179 analyzed patients , 72 % ( 63 ) being male , with a median age of 70 years ( range 27 - 86 years ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line143 In addition to translocations , gene deletions and somatic mutations of <font color="blue">ETV6</font> have been identified in myeloid malignancies , including MDS and AML , with evidence that deletion of <font color="blue">ETV6</font> was frequently accompanied by monosomy 7 . <br>
PMID25465125Line228 The clinical significance of <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations has also been explored . <br>
PMID21714648Line107 Mutation of <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , previously reported as a marker of poor prognosis , did not influence survival in this model , most likely owing to strong associations between oncogenic <font color="blue">NRAS</font> mutations and components of the IPSS . <br>
PMID22878824Line323 Preliminary trials incorporating <font color="blue">FLT3</font> inhibitors either as part of induction or postremission therapy ( including post - HSCT ) continue ; however , the agents currently under investigation have shown only minimal impact . <br>
PMID25465125Line153 The presence of <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutation often accompanies leukocytosis , monosomy 7 / deletion of 7q , isochromosome of 17p , and mutations of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line104 Interestingly , we found a strong correlation between the cohesin gene and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations ( 57 % of cohesin gene mutated patients had an <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation ; 9 . 5 % of <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutated patients had a cohesin gene mutation compared with 4 % of <font color="blue">NPM1</font> wild - type patients ; P = . 029 ) ( Table 1 ) . <br>
PMID23223431Line199 The clinical evolution in MDS or AML of patients with germline <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations is frequently associated with a partial or complete deletion of chromosome 7 : 6 of 11 patients in our study ( 2 with the R330X mutation , 1 with the A372T mutation , 2 with the R396Q mutation , and 1 with deletion of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus ) , 4 of 10 patients in Kazenwadel et al ( T354M , 2 distinct large deletions of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus and a frameshift starting from L332 ) , 6 of 28 patients in Hahn et al ( T354M or deletion of T355 ) , and the case described by Bodor et al ( T354M ) , suggesting that the monosomy 7q is a recurrent secondary event linked to the overt transformation . <br>
PMID21605981Line267 Mechanistic analyses provided evidence for crossregulatory and autoregulatory interactions among components of this complex , including <font color="blue">GATA2</font> induction of the hematopoietic corepressor <font color="blue">ETO2</font> , and an <font color="blue">ETO2</font> negative autoregulatory loop . <br>
PMID23223431Line125 Genetic evaluation finally identified a heterozygous missense <font color="blue">GATA2</font> A372T mutation ( c . 1114G > A , supplemental Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line101 Consequently , we sequenced 120 cases for <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> , <font color="blue">LUC7L2</font> , and <font color="blue">PRPF8</font> and a total 310 for <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> , and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line113 Interestingly , we found a similar mutation burden between <font color="blue">NPM1</font> and genes of the cohesin complex in most patients ( supplemental Figure 1 ) , suggesting that cohesin gene mutations occurred in the same clone as <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID24986690Line35 Inclusion in the current study required the availability of demographic , clinical , and hematologic data at diagnosis ( age , evaluation of constitutional symptoms , hemoglobin level , white blood cell count , and percentage of blasts in peripheral blood ) that allow calculation of IPSS , and at least 1 DNA sample to assess mutation status of the 3 driver genes : <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">MPL</font> , and <font color="blue">CALR</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line257 Two papers have provided new insights into <font color="blue">GATA2</font> regulatory networks by conducting a comprehensive analysis of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> binding sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) , a powerful method for studying transcription factor function . <br>
PMID20601954Line7 As <font color="blue">EZH2</font> functions as a histone methyltransferase , abnormal histone modification may contribute to epigenetic deregulation in MDS . <br>
PMID25465125Line131 In addition , another study indicated that <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mutations were more frequently found in AML with normal karyotype ( 17 . 1 % ) than in unselected cases ( 3 . 8 % ) , but with no differences among low - or high - risk MDS subgroups according to IPSS score . <br>
PMID21605981Line322 Given the essential role of the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> transcription factor in hematopoiesis , it is crucial to elucidate its mechanisms and the full spectrum of target genes that mediate its activity . <br>
PMID23531518Line40 In the analysis of prognostic factors , variables included were age , sex , hemoglobin , white blood cell count ( WBC ) , absolute neutrophil count , absolute monocyte count ( AMC ) , ALC , platelet count , PB and BM blasts , circulating IMC , BM cellularity , percentage of BM ring sideroblasts , WHO morphological subcategories ( CMML - 1 vs CMML - 2 ) , karyotype groups based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk - stratification system , MDAPS and G - MDAPS prognostic risk categories , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations and spliceosome component mutations , involving <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> ( also referred to as <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> ) . <br>

PMID23978506Line142 To ensure that more than 90 % of cases are detected , the adequate analytical sensitivity of a clinical <font color="blue">JAK2</font> assay should be at least 1 % . <br>
PMID23531518Line2 Mayo prognostic model for WHO - defined chronic myelomonocytic leukemia : <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and spliceosome component mutations and outcomes . <br>
PMID23223431Line11 The frequent evolution to MDS and AML in these patients reveals the importance of screening <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in chronic neutropenia associated with monocytopenia because of the frequent hematopoietic transformation , variable clinical expression at onset , and the need for aggressive therapy in patients with poor clinical outcome . <br>
PMID21605981Line150 Conversely , high <font color="blue">FOG1</font> levels in maturing erythroid / megakaryocytic cells inhibit <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression , leading to further elevation of <font color="blue">FOG1</font> and reduced <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression . <br>
PMID21605981Line215 Precise spatio - temporal control of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression is required in early hematopoietic progenitors to determine erythroid / megakaryocyte versus granulocyte / monocyte lineage output , as well as in the subsequent differentiation of erythroid cells and megakaryocytes . <br>
PMID23531518Line91 As mentioned above , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and spliceosome component mutations had no impact on OS . <br>
PMID23619563Line113 Therefore , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations represent a relatively frequent and independent prognostic biomarker in myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID22898539Line100 <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> also forms complexes with <font color="blue">DNMT3L</font> , a DNMT family member that lacks a methyltransferase catalytic domain ; formation of the <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - <font color="blue">DNMT3L</font> complex results in increased <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> activity . <br>
PMID25465125Line183 Patnaik et al identified <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations in 6 . 4 % of patients with isolated del ( 5q ) MDS ( 5 of 77 patients ) , with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F allele burden ranging from 1 % to 10 % . <br>
PMID25006131Line11 Cohesin defects were associated with poor overall survival ( 27 . 2 vs 40 months ; P = . 023 ) , especially in <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutant MDS patients surviving > 12 months ( median survival 35 vs 50 months ; P = . 017 ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line141 Although germline mutations in <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> have been associated with cohesinopathies , pathogenic <font color="blue">STAG1</font> germline mutations have not been reported . <br>
PMID19282830Line153 Table 1 . Clinicohematological characteristics and mutation patterns of patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations at initial diagnosis of CMML . <br>
PMID19282830Line105 Imai et al . found that one of five CMML patients examined had V105X mutation and Nakao et al . reported that one out of eight patients with CMML had <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutation . <br>

For each <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutant patient with available serial samples , the VAF in each sampling is shown . Although only 2 patients were found to harbor a <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation in the dominant clone at the first time point , 7 out of 8 patients ( 87 . 5 % ) who were initially found to have a subclonal <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation underwent clonal expansion , becoming the dominant clone at the time of transformation ( P = . 05 ) . ( D ) VAFs of <font color="blue">SMC3</font> and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> mutations by deep sequencing in serial samples . For 4 patients with <font color="blue">SMC3</font> mutations and the 1 patient with a <font color="blue">RAD21</font> mutation with available serial samples , the VAF in each sampling is shown . All of these 5 patients harbored subclonal cohesin mutations at the first time point , with 2 out of 4 ( 50 % ) of the <font color="blue">SMC3</font> mutant patients and the 1 out of 1 <font color="blue">RAD21</font> mutant patient undergoing clonal expansion , becoming the dominant clone at the time of transformation . <br>
PMID22898539Line246 The first <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation ( <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - V617F ) was identified in patients with MPN and was found to be an activating mutation within the JH2 pseudokinase domain ( reviewed in REF . 92 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line63 In addition to regulating normal neutrophil homeostasis , G - <font color="blue">CSF</font> levels rapidly increase during infection , resulting in elevated levels of neutrophils as a component of the immune response . <br>
PMID23978506Line109 Direct Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing has been used for assessment of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line191 The PcG member that has been most frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of human malignancies is <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , the enzymatic component of the PRC2 complex . <br>
PMID23619563Line75 A multivariable analysis that included all three mutations as covariates confirmed their inter - independent prognostic value : HR was 1 . 91 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 - 3 . 36 ; P = 0 . 025 ) for <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , 2 . 21 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 57 - 3 . 11 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) for <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and 2 . 6 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 63 - 41 . 6 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) for <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations . <br>
PMID23531518Line125 Given the controversy surrounding the c . 1934dupG ; p . Gly646TrpfsX12 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutation , we reanalyzed our cohort after excluding these patients and found no differences in our observations . <br>
PMID21605981Line277 Since <font color="blue">GATA2</font> levels decreased with differentiation in each of the various hematopoietic sub - lineages , this pattern might reflect the ability of overexpressed or activated <font color="blue">GATA2</font> to suppress normal differentiation and promote leukemic transformation . <br>
PMID21605981Line298 Recently , Ayala et al detected <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression by quantitative real - time PCR in 52 % ( 21 / 41 ) cases ; however , their data referred to patients that express <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , instead of patients with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression . <br>
PMID23223431Line189 The molecular consequences of the mutations identified here can be classified in 2 distinct groups , the first with mutations located in or close to the second <font color="blue">GATA2</font> zinc finger ( A372T mutation in P2 located between the third [ C370 ] and fourth [ C373 ] cysteines of the zinc finger , M388V in P3 and R396Q in P1 ) and the second with the complete loss of 1 allele of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> ( P7 ) or creation of a stop codon leading to the loss of the second zinc finger ( R330X mutation in P4 located in the first zinc finger , R204X [ P5 ] and E224X [ P6 ] mutations leading to the loss of the 2 zinc fingers ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line60 This will also be informative regarding the extent to which <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation is a primary driver of disease . <br>
PMID22878824Line127 Interestingly , the <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R172 mutation seemed to be mutually exclusive with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations and <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD . <br>
PMID22898539Line252 This phosphorylation causes downregulation of <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> activity and blocks the specific interaction of <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> with methylosome protein 50 ( <font color="blue">MEP50</font> ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line10 Median overall survival was 17 . 7 years in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant , 9 . 2 years in <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant , 9 . 1 years in <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant , and 3 . 2 years in triple - negative patients . <br>
PMID24986690Line168 Figure 6 . Kaplan - Meier analysis of survival of PMF patients stratified according to the risk categories defined by a clinical - molecular prognostic model . This model includes the variables reported in Table 2 , that is , IPSS variables plus <font color="blue">CALR</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation status . We assigned each factor an integer weight according to the corresponding HR in the multivariable - Cox regression of Table 2 . Scores were then recoded into the 5 risk categories shown in this figure : details are reported in the last section of " Results . " Based on the Akaike information criterion , which compares quality of models , the clinical - molecular model provided a better stratification than the IPSS . This analysis serves as a proof of concept that accounting for driver mutations improves the risk stratification provided by IPSS . <br>
PMID23223431Line132 We identified a heterozygous missense <font color="blue">GATA2</font> M388V mutation ( c . 1162A > G , supplemental Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line28 Recent studies have also identified subclonal mutations in genes like <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , which are commonly associated with disease progression and identify PMF patients at high risk for leukemic transformation or premature death . <br>
PMID25465125Line133 Multivariate analysis consisting of age , IPSS score , transfusion dependency , and mutational status indicated that the presence of a <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mutation was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS . <br>
PMID23054646Line71 However , the lower repopulation of mutant - transduced stem cells raises a serious difficulty to our understanding of how <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutated cells achieve clonal dominance over the remaining normal hematopoietic cells , although some oncogenes , such as oncogenic RAS , have been shown to induce apoptosis rather than transformation and promotion of cell growth depending on cell contexts . <br>
PMID25465125Line55 In vitro data suggest that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors ( DNMTIs ; e . g . , decitabine and azacitidine ) suppress the protein expression of <font color="blue">DNMT1</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , followed by suppression of growth and methylation in leukemic cell lines , whereas <font color="blue">DNMT3B</font> mutations have been identified in inherited immunodeficiency , centrosome instability , and facial anomalies ( ICF syndrome ) . <br>

PMID22210327Line34 Although targeting of <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations to the expressed allele in female AML patients was not formally demonstrated by Li et al , the above findings again point to <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> as a tumor - suppressor gene that is inactivated by mutations in a subset of AML . <br>

PMID21605981Line256 Moreover , it has been demonstrated that <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and / or <font color="blue">GATA2</font> bind to a GATA motif located at the 3 ' enhancer region of <font color="blue">WT1</font> , playing an important role in the regulation of <font color="blue">WT1</font> gene expression . <br>
PMID25465125Line130 A recent study in 354 patients with MDS showed that mutations of <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> were identified in 4 . 8 % and 0 . 8 % of these patients , respectively , with higher frequency in patients with CMML and AML ( 7 . 4 % and 9 . 1 % , respectively ) . <br>

PMID22898539Line304 Figure 4 . The contribution of Polycomb - mediated gene repression to the pathophysiology of APL . Fusion of the <font color="blue">promyelocytic leukaemia</font> ( <font color="blue">PML</font> ) gene to the <font color="blue">retinoic acid receptor - alpha</font> ( <font color="blue">RARA</font> ) gene results in a hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukaemia ( APL ) : the <font color="blue">PML</font> - <font color="blue">RARA</font> fusion . Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) has been found to directly associate with the PML - RARalpha fusion protein but not to either endogenous protein alone . PRC2 - mediated transcriptional repression is thought to have a role in the leukaemogenic activity of PML - RARalpha , and the loss of PRC2 components in mouse models of APL results in the differentiation of APL cells . A variant RARalpha translocation is the <font color="blue">promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger</font> ( <font color="blue">PLZF</font> ) - RARalpha fusion , which results in a form of APL that is insensitive to all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) , the main therapeutic modality used to treat patients with APL . Interestingly , it has been shown that unlike PML - RARalpha , <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha also interacts with <font color="blue">PRC1</font> via direct association with <font color="blue">BMI1</font> ( REF . 98 ) . Treatment with ATRA results in a loss of PRC2 recruitment by <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha , whereas <font color="blue">PRC1</font> - mediated gene repression persists in an ATRA - insensitive manner . This explains , at least in part , the lack of efficacy of ATRA in <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha - positive APL . <font color="blue">CBX4</font> , <font color="blue">chromobox protein homologue 4</font> ; <font color="blue">EED</font> , <font color="blue">embryonic ectoderm development</font> ; <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">enhancer of zeste homologue 2</font> ; H2AK119Ub , histone H2A ubiquitylated on lysine 119 ; H3K27me3 , histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 27 ; <font color="blue">PH1</font> , polyhomeotic - like protein 1 ; <font color="blue">SUZ12</font> , <font color="blue">suppressor of zeste 12 homologue</font> . <br>

PMID22878824Line146 Currently , the interactions of both <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> and DNMT3 mutations with other molecular changes require further investigation to determine the prognostic value in patients with NK - AML . <br>
PMID22878824Line318 The presence of an isolated <font color="blue">NPM1</font> or <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> mutation improves prognosis only slightly less than for patients with <font color="blue">CBF</font> translocations ( see " Initial Evaluation " on page 999 ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line148 Although initial reports ( 354 patients ) suggested <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations convey significantly longer OS , leukemia - free survival ( LFS ) , and event - free survival in their cohort , subsequent analysis of 323 MDS cases , patients carrying an <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutation showed a significantly better OS and no effect on LFS in RARS and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with ringed sideroblasts ( RCMD - RS ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line83 There is no difference in analytical performance using peripheral blood or bone marrow samples for testing for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations , because granulocytes constitute the predominant population in both specimens . <br>
PMID23619563Line33 For the European cohort , the Sanger technique was used to detect mutations across the entire coding region of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">TET2</font> , and regions previously described as mutational hotspots for <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> ; JAK2V617F was detected by real - time PCR ( RT - PCR ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line96 Which Methodologies Are Used to Detect <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> Mutations ? <br>
PMID23978506Line34 To address these issues from the laboratory perspective , here we present practice guidelines for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation testing and reporting . <br>
PMID23619563Line77 In multivariable analysis that included the four mutations as covariates , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( HR : 2 . 5 , 95 % CI : 1 . 5 - 4 . 1 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> ( HR : 2 . 73 , 95 % CI : 1 . 34 - 5 . 55 ; P = 0 . 005 ) and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ( HR : 2 . 66 , 95 % CI : 1 . 10 - 6 . 47 ; P = 0 . 03 ) , but not <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( HR : 1 . 98 , 95 % CI : 0 . 88 - 4 . 46 ) , mutations remained significant . <br>
PMID23531518Line87 In univariate analysis , the presence of <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> or <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutations had no prognostic impact on OS or leukemia free survival ( Table 3 and Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line245 If the clinical utility of mutations in other genes ( eg , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ) is established for MPNs , next - generation sequencing provides a way to expand the scope of the assay without significantly increasing the work required to perform the test . <br>
PMID22898539Line147 In addition , an increase in immature thymic T cells and mature splenic B cells was observed in at least one <font color="blue">Tet2</font> - knockout mouse model , consistent with effects on lymphoid fate commitment . <br>
PMID23531518Line8 Spliceosome component ( P = 0 . 4 ) and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations ( P = 0 . 37 ) had no impact survival . <br>
PMID21605981Line247 <font color="blue">GATA1</font> inhibits <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> by preventing its interaction with the co - activator c - <font color="blue">JUN</font> , whereas <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> blocks <font color="blue">GATA1</font> function by inhibiting its ability to bind to DNA . <br>
PMID22878824Line331 In patients older than 60 years , the proportion of those with favorable <font color="blue">CBF</font> translocations decreases , as does the number with isolated <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations , whereas the number of those with unfavorable karyotypes and mutations increases . <br>
PMID22323480Line197 Figure 3 . Unsplicing of specific genes because of spliceosomal mutations as detected by deep RNA sequencing . Next - generation - based RNA deep sequencing was used to quantitatively study splicing patterns . ( A ) The top panel shows the intron 5 and exon 6 boundary of <font color="blue">TET2</font> ( dotted line ) . Five reads correspond to transcripts that were not spliced ( unspliced ) and 4 were spliced at this boundary . The bottom panel shows read counts at the 5 ' and 3 ' splice sites of each intron ( 3 - 10 ) of <font color="blue">TET2</font> . White and black bars indicate the number of spliced and unspliced reads , respectively . In a case of AML with a <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutation , more unspliced than spliced reads were observed at the 3 ' splice site of intron 5 ( left panel ) , probably because of a loss of spliceosome function . However , unspliced RNAs were less frequent than spliced RNAs in WT RNA sequencing ( right panel ) . ( B ) At both the 3 ' and 5 ' splice sites of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> intron 6 , unspliced reads were more frequent than spliced reads in AML cases with <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations . However , there were fewer unspliced transcripts at the same site in WT and <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutant samples . Splicing abnormalities in the selected genes are summarized ( bottom right ) , including the results presented in detail in supplemental Figures 7 and 8 . <br>
PMID25465125Line45 Conflicting data exist regarding the prognostic impact of <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations in MDS . <br>
PMID24335498Line108 No correlation was observed between genes in the cohesin complex and other mutations such as <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , or <font color="blue">NRAS</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25006131Line82 In <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , we detected mutations in 17 females ( 14 heterozygous and 3 homozygous ) and in 44 males ( hemizygous ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line93 Using target gene sequencing technology , Gelsi - Boyer et al first identified <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations in 11 % of MDS patients and 43 % of patients with CMML . <br>
PMID21605981Line52 The human <font color="blue">GATA2</font> gene ( 13 , 760 kb ) , cloned by Lee et al is located on 3q21 and has 6 exons . <br>
PMID21714648Line51 Next - generation pyrosequencing of PCR - amplified exons of <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">CDKN2A</font> , <font color="blue">PTEN</font> , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> exon 11 , and <font color="blue">CBL</font> exons 8 and 9 was performed with the use of a next - generation sequencing platform ( 454 Life Sciences ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line166 Studies have shown that c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations are associated with decreased remission duration ( eg , EFS and relapse - free survival ) and decreased OS in both groups of patients with t ( 8 ; 21 ) or inv ( 16 ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line119 In MDS / MPN , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations were more common than <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> ; however , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations were associated with shorter survival ( Figure 2B ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line104 These drugs are expected to be more effective in the chronic phase of disease before increasing genetic complexity associated with disease transformation supervenes , and therapeutic inhibition of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> - related signaling may be less relevant . <br>
PMID22323480Line141 Although these mutations were common and found in a wide spectrum of myeloid diseases , some are strongly associated with specific phenotypic features , such as <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations with MDS or MDS / MPN with RS and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations with CMML and advanced forms of MDS such as sAML and RA with excess blasts . <br>
PMID21605981Line135 Interestingly , prior to gene repression by <font color="blue">GATA1</font> , the SCL complex was frequently found to correlate with the presence of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , suggesting that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> might function via SCL to activate <font color="blue">KIT</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression in immature erythroid cells . <br>
PMID23619563Line128 Figure 4 . Three - tiered dynamic DIPSS - plus stratified survival data in 279 patients with PMF sub - stratified according to <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutation status ( a ) and according to <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> / <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> / <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutation status ( b ) . <br>
PMID25006131Line113 In this cross - sectional analysis of the cohesin mutant cohort , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> mutant clones were ancestral in only 18 % of the cases . <br>
PMID23978506Line143 When the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F level of a particular patient falls below 1 % , however , caution must be exercised , because very low levels of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutations ( usually < 0 . 1 % ) have been described in peripheral blood of unaffected individuals . <br>
PMID10706759Line2 Mutation Analysis of <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> in Acute Myeloid Leukemia . <br>
PMID22323480Line89 In a patient with sAML , we identified a somatic mutation ( M1307I ) in <font color="blue">PRPF8</font> and a heterozygous mutation ( R27X ) in <font color="blue">LUC7L2</font> , respectively ( Figure 1C ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line95 When considering the type of <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation , patients carrying a type 1 <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation had a better OS compared with patients carrying <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) ( P < . 001 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line329 Fig . 2 . ' GATA factor switching ' and ' GATA switch ' in erythropoiesis . <font color="blue">GATA2</font> has a role in the regulation of its own transcription binding to its promoter and working as an enhancer of its transcription . During erythroid differentiation , expression of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> is up - regulated and <font color="blue">GATA1</font> replaces <font color="blue">GATA2</font> at the same motifs and , as a result , inhibits <font color="blue">GATA2</font> transcription . The ' GATA switch ' requires the interaction of different proteins , such as <font color="blue">GATA1</font> - <font color="blue">FOG1</font> and <font color="blue">FOG1</font> - NuRD binding . <br>
PMID23531518Line76 There was no difference in age ( P = 0 . 6 ) , gender ( P = 0 . 23 ) , hemoglobin values ( P = 0 . 07 ) , platelet count ( P = 0 . 09 ) , ALC ( P = 0 . 79 ) , PB ( P = 0 . 5 ) and BM ( 0 . 27 ) blasts , WHO histological categories ( P = 0 . 3 ) and the incidence of <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> ( P = 0 . 57 ) and <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> ( P = 0 . 43 ) mutations . <br>
PMID21605981Line156 Besides , a cell - cycle - dependent regulation of both <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression and degradation has been demonstrated through its phosphorylation by CDK / cyclin systems at CDK consensus motifs ( S / T0P + 1 ) , suggesting that hematopoietic - cell proliferation may be modulated by expression of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in tandem with cell - cycle regulators . <br>
PMID21605981Line114 <font color="blue">CtBP1</font> and - 2 interact specifically with <font color="blue">FOG1</font> through a motif located in the C - terminal half of <font color="blue">FOG1</font> ; however , although transient transfection assays suggested that the <font color="blue">FOG1</font> / CtBP interaction is important for mediating transcriptional repression , mice harboring a mutant <font color="blue">FOG1</font> with a disrupted CtBP - binding motif showed normal hematopoietic development , indicating that the <font color="blue">FOG1</font> / CtBP interaction is not required for <font color="blue">FOG1</font> function in vivo . <br>
PMID23896413Line70 A recent paper described a case of a SCN patient who acquired a <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> truncation mutation followed by a T618I point mutation ( reported as T595I using the traditional <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> numbering system that does not include the signal peptide ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line225 Somatic mutations of <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> ( mainly at the proline 95 position ) have been reported in MDS patients with an incidence of 11 - 15 % . <br>
PMID25465125Line160 The gene encoded <font color="blue">GATA binding protein 2</font> ( <font color="blue">globin transcription factor 2</font> ) ( <font color="blue">GATA2</font> ) is a transcription factor that is crucial for the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells . <br>
PMID19282830Line107 In contrast to earlier studies , our result , which included the largest cohort of CMML patients who had no earlier history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy , showed for the first time a very high frequency of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations , which was comparable with those reported in atomic bomb survivors or in chemotherapy - related MDS . <br>
PMID25465125Line194 Interestingly , the rate of <font color="blue">CBL</font> mutation was found to be significantly higher in secondary MDS compared with de novo MDS ( 11 . 7 % versus 0 . 6 % , respectively ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line86 The loss of function for <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> appears to occur during the progression of multiple human cancers . <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> has also been identified as the gene responsible for Cowden disease , a rare familial syndrome associated with an elevated risk for tumors of the breast , thyroid , and skin , and BannayanZonana syndrome , a related harmartomatous polyposis syndrome . <br>
PMID21605981Line181 Several in vivo experimental approaches have been explored to assess <font color="blue">GATA2</font> function in hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID23619563Line108 Similarly , the presence of <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> or <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations appears to predict leukemia independent of currently known risk factors including thrombocytopenia and unfavorable karyotype . <br>
PMID22323480Line152 More recently , a large series of patients with MDS ( N = 317 ) showed that the <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutation status was not associated with time to AML progression or OS , regardless if all patients or only the subgroup of patients with RS were included in the analyses . <br>
PMID21714648Line128 Therefore , lower - risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who have <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations may require more aggressive treatment than would be predicted by the IPSS . <br>
PMID22878824Line140 Studies have shown significantly decreased OS outcomes among patients with <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations compared with those with the wild - type gene ( median OS , 12 - 21 vs . 40 - 41 months ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line92 In follow - up sequencing of an expanded cohort of 29 patients from the New England Journal of Medicine report , 21 % have exhibited both <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> and <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations , with 31 % of samples having <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations only and 7 % with <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations only ( Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line118 These results are also consistent with previous suggestions that mutations affecting epigenetic regulation might be prognostically more relevant than those involved with JAK - <font color="blue">STAT</font> signaling . <br>
PMID23223431Line121 The karyotype identified a translocation involving <font color="blue">MLL</font> along with a monosomy 7 . <br>
PMID22898539Line109 Whether the same set of genes is subject to altered epigenetic patterning in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - mutant AML cells has not been investigated . <br>
PMID23978506Line9 This Special Article also points to future directions for genomic testing in <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative myeloproliferative neoplasms . <br>
PMID21339759Line46 We next investigated associations of distinct mutations , however , no specific pattern was observed , that is , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations were detected in combination with <font color="blue">TET2</font> alterations ( 4 / 10 ) , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( 3 / 10 ) , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ( 3 / 10 ) , <font color="blue">CBL</font> ( 2 / 10 ) , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( 2 / 10 ) , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> ( 2 / 10 ) , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> ( 1 / 10 ) and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ( 1 / 10 ) , respectively ( Figure 1a ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line14 In addition , the recent discovery of frequent mutations of epigenetic regulators engaged in DNA methylation ( <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 ) and histone modifications ( <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and other components of Polycomb complex 2 ) in MDS suggested a central role of a compromised epigenetic regulation in their pathogenesis . <br>
PMID25465125Line210 <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> . <br>
PMID23223431Line201 In addition to <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> and <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> mutations , monosomy 7 was associated with pure familial MDS / AML in 14 pedigrees with an autosomal - dominant transmission and a young age ( < 18 years ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line90 Although there are small - molecule inhibitors for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , such as ruxolitinib [ approved by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for myelofibrosis ] , these target the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and often the <font color="blue">JAK1</font> proteins , and thus are not specific for the V617F mutation . <br>
PMID24335498Line83 The second most frequently mutated genes in the cohesin complex were <font color="blue">SMC3</font> and <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , and we found 5 patients with these mutations , respectively . <br>
PMID24986690Line44 Patients with nonmutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> were studied for <font color="blue">CALR</font> exon 9 mutations as reported in our original article or by Sanger sequencing , as described elsewhere . <br>
PMID22878824Line141 Significantly decreased OS with <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations has also been reported in the subgroup of patients with NK - AML with wild - type <font color="blue">NPM1</font> with or without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD or <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation in the presence of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , but not in the favorable subgroup with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD . <br>
PMID10706759Line95 Mutational analysis of the entire 9 coding exons showed that only one cell line ( U937 ) had a frameshift mutation resulting in premature termination of the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> protein . <br>
PMID10706759Line12 Our results indicate that the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene may play a role in a small percentage of AML , but its significance needs to be further evaluated . <br>
PMID23978506Line74 Clinically verified <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations are listed in Table 2 . <br>
PMID23619563Line89 Notably , the prognostic relevance of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations was mostly restricted to patients with either intermediate - 2 risk ( P = 0 . 03 ) or intermediate - 1 plus low - risk disease ( P = 0 . 07 ) unlike high - risk disease ( P = 0 . 78 ) ( Figure 4a ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line184 The presence of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation did not affect blood counts or clinical outcomes between patients with and without <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F . <br>
PMID22035746Line36 JAK2V617F is the best characterized mutation in <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPN . <br>
PMID24986690Line103 Evidence that accounting for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation status improves the risk stratification provided by IPSS . <br>
PMID25465125Line151 An identical mutational variant of <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> has also been described in Schinzel - Giedion midface retraction syndrome . <br>
PMID25465125Line115 <font color="blue">UTX</font> , in conjunction with the other epigenetic genes ( e . g . , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ) , regulates histone methylation . <br>
PMID22878824Line135 The <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations have been reported in 18 % to 22 % of patients with AML , with a frequency of 29 % to 34 % in those with NK - AML . <br>
PMID21605981Line250 To better understand the role of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , further studies addressed to identify the downstream targets that mediate the effects of this transcription factor would be needed . <br>
PMID25465125Line179 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line96 Only the mutation in R381Q of <font color="blue">SMC3</font> was recurrent in 2 patients , whereas all other mutations were only identified once ( Figure 1 and supplemental Table 4 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line20 A diagnosis of PV can be made when <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F or exon 12 mutation is detected , along with increased hemoglobin and low or normal levels of <font color="blue">erythropoietin</font> . <br>
PMID23896413Line71 <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> truncation mutations result in a loss of a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor , suggesting possible molecular mechanisms for receptor activation . <br>
PMID24986690Line102 Within " higher - risk " subjects ( Figure 5B ) , <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had a better OS compared with all the remaining genetic subgroups ( P = . 023 compared with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant , P = . 003 compared with <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant , and P = . 001 compared with triple - negative patients ) . <br>

PMID21605981Line167 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is degraded through ubiquitination - proteasome - dependent systems and three regions located in the non - finger areas ( amino acids 1 - - 70 , 153 - - 256 and 412 - - 480 ) appear to be important for its degradation . <br>
PMID22878824Line150 <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations can occur concurrently with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , and patients who have both genetic lesions have an outcome more similar to those with isolated <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD mutations . <br>
PMID24986690Line97 These results were confirmed after adjusting for time - dependent DIPSS , with a better OS of patients with type 1 <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation compared with those with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) ( HR 2 . 01 , P = . 04 ) , and no difference between patients with type 1 and those with type 2 <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation , as well as between patients with type 2 <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation and those with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line89 Quantitative real time PCR ( qPCR ) testing for monitoring <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F allele burden has been limited to patients enrolled in clinical trials such as the peg - <font color="blue">IFN</font> - a - 2a and MF - TG101348 - 001 trials . <br>
PMID22898539Line199 Recently , a more diverse range of missense , nonsense and frameshift mutations in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> were identified in patients with myeloid malignancies , most commonly PRC2 complex in MDS , CMML and primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) and rarely in other chronic or acute myeloid malignancies ( FIG . 2 ; TABLE 1 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line187 <font color="blue">CBL</font> . <br>
PMID25465125Line218 The deficiency of <font color="blue">ABCB7</font> protein is related to mitochondrial iron overload , reduced heme synthesis at earlier phase of erythroid precursors , and ineffective erythropoiesis . <br>
PMID25465125Line256 The presence of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation appeared to be associated with adverse clinical outcome and an increase in bone marrow blasts . <br>
PMID21605981Line313 Besides , an essential contribution of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> to urogenital development has been shown . <br>
PMID21605981Line269 Besides , it is known that an E - box - WGATAR composite element residing within a <font color="blue">GATA2</font> intron ( 9 . 5 kb downstream of the transcription start site ) confers strong enhancer activity in <font color="blue">GATA2</font> - expressing cells in vitro and in the vasculature and fetal liver of mouse embryos . <br>
PMID23896413Line69 Additionally , similar to our observations in CNL / aCML , SCN patients can acquire compound <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations . <br>
PMID21605981Line87 On the other hand , it has been recently shown that the - 2 . 8 kb site confers maximal <font color="blue">Gata2</font> expression in HSCs and progenitors in specific contexts , demonstrating that the - 2 . 8 kb site is not required for initiation or maintenance of <font color="blue">Gata2</font> repression during erythroid differentiation . <br>
PMID23619563Line87 However , when each one of the four mutations was individually evaluated in the context of DIPSS - plus , only <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations remained significant ( HR : 1 . 4 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 - 1 . 9 ; P = 0 . 04 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line121 What Are the Technical Issues Associated with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> Mutation Testing ? <br>
PMID25006131Line131 When comparing patients with reduced expression or mutation of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> to patients with intact expression of WT <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , we identified 28 genes , which were differentially expressed in patients with <font color="blue">STAG2</font> alterations regardless of whether this was due to somatic mutations or transcriptional downregulation ( supplemental Table 13 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line109 Moreover , <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutation as the sole genetic aberration or occurring concurrently with t ( 15 ; 17 ) / <font color="blue">PML</font> - <font color="blue">RARA</font> ( underlying lesion in the APL subtype ) or with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD ( <font color="blue">FLT3</font> double mutation ) has been associated with poorer outcomes . <br>
PMID19282830Line6 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations have rarely been reported in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMML ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line101 The <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> genes are regulated through dynamic changes in the occupancy by GATA factors of GATA motifs in their regulatory regions , so that there must be a switch controlled by GATA factors in <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> gene expression . <br>
PMID20601954Line23 However , a frameshift mutation in exon 7 ( 703delGinsAA , nomenclature as described in ref . 5 ) introducing a premature stop codon was found in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( Table 1 , Supplementary Figs . 2 and 3 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line299 Moreover , in our cases with normal karyotype AML , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression was significantly associated with other molecular markers in AML as <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations , and <font color="blue">EVI1</font> and <font color="blue">WT1</font> overexpression . <br>
PMID25465125Line107 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations may also co - occur with <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations and have been frequently found in high - grade MDS . <br>
PMID21605981Line44 Similarly , the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> knock - out mouse has profound defects in definitive hematopoiesis : <font color="blue">Gata2</font> - deficient embryos die of anemia at day 10 - 11 of gestation , and show defects in the self - renewal and proliferation capacity of HSC . <br>
PMID22035746Line56 Additional <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations have since been described at the same locus , with an overall <font color="blue">MPL515</font> mutational frequency estimated at 4 % for ET and 11 % for PMF . <br>
PMID23223431Line224 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations are indicated as protein ( first line ) or nucleotide ( second line ) variations . Complete blood count was collected during routine at baseline before HSCT in absence of clonal hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID23978506Line203 Five laboratories also offered <font color="blue">JAK2</font> exon 12 assays , two laboratories offered <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation assays , and another two provided <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation results ( although their assays were still being validated ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line90 The male patients had a functionally homozygous mutation for <font color="blue">STAG2</font> and <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line111 The TET family of proteins was first identified with the cloning of <font color="blue">TET1</font> as a fusion partner of <font color="blue">MLL</font> in patients with t ( 10 ; 11 ) ( q22 ; q23 ) AML . <br>
PMID22898539Line226 Although several mutational studies of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> have been impaired by the inclusion of nonsomatic variants , mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> are associated with poor outcome in patients with MDS and in patients with AML . <br>
PMID22898539Line254 Thus <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> and histone H3 - Y41 can lead to direct alterations in epigenetic patterning . <br>
PMID24335498Line164 The high - risk molecular group is defined as either <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - wild - type / <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD - negative , or <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - wild - type / <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD - positive , or <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - mutated / <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD - positive . The low - risk molecular group is defined by the presence of an <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation and the absence of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD . <br>
PMID22898539Line115 Although the results of clinical correlative studies have not been uniform , in the largest series , <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations were associated with poorer prognosis in patients with favourable - risk , cytogenetically normal AML ( CN - AML ) , whereas studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent prognostic relevance of <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations in patients with MPN or MDS . <br>
PMID23223431Line188 We identified 7 different <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in 14 patients coming from 7 pedigrees ( Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID25006131Line85 Similarly , 15 out of 20 <font color="blue">RAD21</font> sequence alterations were nonsense ( n = 2 ) , frameshift ( n = 11 ) , or splice site ( n = 2 ) mutations causing low expression of the gene ; 5 were missense mutations . <br>
PMID21605981Line226 <font color="blue">ETS1</font> , likewise involved in megakaryocyte development , increases during megakaryocyte maturation , and its overexpression is associated with enhanced differentiation and upregulation of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and other megakaryocyte - specific genes . <br>
PMID21605981Line9 Moreover , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is crucial for the proliferation and maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells and multipotential progenitors . <br>
PMID21605981Line38 In mice , <font color="blue">Gata1</font> null defects in erythroid cells can be partially rescued by knocking in <font color="blue">Gata3</font> into the endogenous <font color="blue">Gata1</font> locus . <br>
PMID23978506Line179 A number of AML cell lines are positive for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F , including HEL , MB - 02 , MUTZ - 8 , SET - 2 , UKE - 1 . <br>
PMID19282830Line25 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> is also known as <font color="blue">AML1</font> and acts to regulate the expression of various genes specific for hematopoiesis , including <font color="blue">G - CSF</font> , <font color="blue">IL - 3</font> , T - cell receptor and <font color="blue">myeloperoxidase</font> . <br>
PMID22210327Line14 Instead , Li et al found <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> to be mutated by searching for recurrent mutations in a discovery cohort of 8 patients with secondary AML ( s - AML ) that were subjected to whole - exome sequencing . <br>
PMID22898539Line210 Recent work demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> also results in myeloid transformation , implying that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> may serve as both an oncogene and a tumour suppressor gene in the myeloid compartment . <br>
PMID24986690Line72 The cumulative incidence of marked leukocytosis was significantly lower in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients compared with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant ( P = . 004 ) or triple - negative patients ( P < . 001 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line101 <font color="blue">DNMT3L</font> binds to histone H3 tails in the absence of K4 methylation , which leads to the recruitment of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> activity to specific loci . <br>
PMID19282830Line134 Our results showed that 16 . 7 % of CMML patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations had <font color="blue">FLT3</font> or RAS mutations . <br>
PMID24986690Line124 In fact , this identification has split PMF patients with nonmutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> ( about one - third of all patients with PMF ) into 2 distinct subtypes ( Figure 7 ) : ( 1 ) <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant PMF , a condition with an indolent clinical course and ( 2 ) PMF with nonmutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , and <font color="blue">MPL</font> , a very aggressive myeloid neoplasm . <br>
PMID23978506Line25 Although detection of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations in the appropriate clinical settings confirms the diagnosis of ET or PMF , absence of the mutations does not rule out disease . <br>
PMID25465125Line163 Emberger ( an autosomal dominant primary lymphedema with predisposition to AML ) and MonoMAC ( monocytopenia with Mycobacterium avium complex ) syndromes are the two common inherited diseases that appear to be associated with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations . <br>
PMID23978506Line146 Therefore , if other World Health Organization major and minor diagnostic criteria are met , finding such a low - positive <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation may still be clinically relevant . <br>
PMID22898539Line107 These studies revealed that deletion of <font color="blue">Dnmt3a</font> resulted in progressive expansion of the long - term haematopoietic stem cell ( LT - HSC ) pool without increasing HSC proliferation or altering haematopoietic differentiation . <br>
PMID23223431Line47 The selection criteria were the absence of mutations for the major genes involved in congenital neutropenia ( <font color="blue">ELANE</font> , <font color="blue">CXCR4</font> , <font color="blue">SBDS</font> , <font color="blue">HAX1</font> , and <font color="blue">G6PC3</font> ; n = 288 patients ) and the presence of clinical features associated with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations : leg lymphedema , warts , and evolution to MDS / AML . <br>
PMID22898539Line132 Similar studies that map 5 - hmC localization in the haematopoietic system , and the identity of specific <font color="blue">TET2</font> target genes in haematopoietic cells , have not been reported to date . <br>
PMID23896413Line83 <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> is mutated at lower frequencies in unclassified MDS / MPN ( 10 % ) and CMML ( 4 % ) , but no <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations are found in AML , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , or solid tumors . <br>
PMID21714648Line28 Mutations in <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> have each been reported to influence overall survival in univariate analyses . <br>
PMID21714648Line108 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations , which have not previously been associated with known prognostic markers , retained a strong association with survival in our model . <br>
PMID25006131Line163 In exploring the effects of cohesin downmodulation / mutations on expression pattern in cohort , we noted a consistent down - modulation of <font color="blue">DCK</font> in patients with cohesin complex alterations . <br>
PMID25465125Line235 <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations are detected in approximately 8 % of patients with MDS . <br>
PMID21714648Line156 Figure 4 . Overall Survival , According to International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) Risk Category and Mutational Status . Panel A shows the overall survival of patients within each IPSS risk group . Panel B shows the overall survival of patients with mutations in one or more of the five prognostic genes ( <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , or <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ) as compared with patients without such mutations . Panels C through F show the overall survival of patients according to the presence and absence of prognostic mutations and according to IPSS risk group . In Panels C , D , and E , the overall - survival curve for patients in the next - highest IPSS risk group is included for the purpose of comparison . In Panel F , the comparison curve is for patients in the next - lowest IPSS risk group . P values were calculated for the log - rank comparison of overall survival between patients with mutations and those without mutations for the given IPSS risk group . The IPSS risk classification , which is based on the percentage of blasts in bone marrow , the karyotype , and the number of cytopenias ( Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix ) , was recalculated for 428 of the 439 samples at the time of bone marrow sample collection ( the IPSS classification could not be recalculated for 11 samples ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line142 A recent study reported that in younger patients ( age < 60 years ) with NK - AML , presence of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations was associated with significantly decreased OS compared with the wild - type gene ( 5 - year OS rate , 23 % vs . 45 % ; P = . 02 ) . <br>
PMID22210327Line43 Moreover , <font color="blue">BCOR</font> increases the repression of transcriptional activity by interacting with class I and II HDACs , the polycomb group protein <font color="blue">PCGF1</font> / <font color="blue">NSPC1</font> and the histone demethylase <font color="blue">FBXL10</font> , which implies <font color="blue">BCOR</font> may suppress gene transcription by epigenetic mechanisms . <br>
PMID23223431Line33 The frequent evolution to MDS and AML of patients with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations reveals the importance of screening for this mutation in chronic neutropenia , especially when associated with monocytopenia because of frequent hematopoietic transformation , variable clinical expression at onset , and the need of aggressive strategy therapy in patients with poor clinical outcome . <br>
PMID24335498Line138 Interestingly , mutations in this complex were mutually exclusive , similar to other mutations that belonged to 1 pathway similar to genes of the spliceosome complex or mutations in <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , and <font color="blue">TET2</font> . <br>
PMID22878824Line303 Thus , for this subgroup of patients , high - dose cytarabine followed by autologous HSCT should be the preferred HSCT option , and allogeneic HSCT may be better reserved as salvage therapy or for those with c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations . <br>
PMID10706759Line19 On the basis of such findings , <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> has been considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene that may play a role in varied malignancies . Chromosome 10q23 . 3 is deleted in a variety of primary tumors including myeloid leukemia . <br>
PMID19282830Line118 Our data showed that the locations of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in CMML patients were similar to those observed in therapy - related MDS / AML rather than in de novo MDS / AML . <br>
PMID21605981Line291 Inappropriate expression of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> has been observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome , related to severe dysplasia . <br>
PMID23978506Line180 All except SET - 2 are homozygous mutant , but some ( eg , HEL ) have more than two copies of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and as such are not ideal as standards . <br>
PMID23978506Line202 Of the 22 laboratories , 13 used in - house tests for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F and the remaining 9 used commercial assays ; 14 laboratories performed only qualitative assays , 5 performed only quantitative assays , and 3 performed both quantitative and qualitative assays . <br>
PMID23619563Line8 Samples from the European cohort , collected at time of diagnosis , were analyzed for mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">MPL</font> and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> . <br>
PMID23223431Line115 Because the clinical presentation of pedigree 1 was initially chronic neutropenia , we investigated the presence of mutations of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry . <br>
PMID22878824Line114 The most common of these include mutations in <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> genes , which encode for <font color="blue">isocitrate dehydrogenase 1</font> and 2 , respectively , and mutations in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , which encode for <font color="blue">DNA methyltransferase 3A</font> . <br>
PMID21339759Line9 Mutations in <font color="blue">NPM1</font> have been described in 6 % ( 6 / 97 ) of CMML patients and were associated with a poor prognosis . <br>
PMID21605981Line211 Decreased levels of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> compromise the proliferation and survival of HSCs . <br>
PMID21605981Line252 It has been shown that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> inhibits erythroid differentiation through direct regulation of EPO activity . <br>
PMID22898539Line131 <font color="blue">TET1</font> target genes can either be activated or repressed , depending on the presence of PRC2 or existing chromatin marks . <br>
PMID21605981Line218 The expression levels of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> partially determine the fate along megakaryocyte - erythroid differentiation pathways . <br>
PMID19282830Line120 On the other hand , frameshift or nonsense mutations were distributed throughout the entire <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> gene in both N - terminal and C - terminal parts . <br>
PMID22035746Line22 This review will focus on the latest developments in the molecular biology , diagnosis , and treatment of classic <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPNs . <br>
PMID24986690Line143 The only relevant observation was the higher frequency of <font color="blue">CALR</font> type 1 mutation in PMF compared with ET , which may suggest a particularly active role of the 52 - bp deletion in causing bone marrow fibrosis . <br>
PMID23054646Line49 For example , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> was shown to participate in Hox gene regulation through functional interaction with polycomb and trithorax genes . <br>
PMID22898539Line196 More recently , somatic , heterozygous activating mutations of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> that affect Y641 have been identified in germinal - centre diffuse large - B - cell lymphomas . <br>
PMID22898539Line212 In contrast with our incomplete understanding of the biological implications of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations in myeloid malignancy pathogenesis , correlative studies have demonstrated that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations are a marker for adverse outcome in MDS and PMF . <br>
PMID23978506Line94 Thus , for routine clinical practice , there is no recommended schedule for follow - up <font color="blue">JAK2</font> testing , whether qualitative or quantitative . <br>
PMID23896413Line91 <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> and <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations are not mutually exclusive in CNL / aCML . <br>
PMID23896413Line68 Approximately one - third of SCN patients eventually acquire truncation mutations in <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ( analogous to the truncation mutations we have observed in de novo CNL and aCML ) , which are associated with transformation to myelodysplasia or AML . <br>
PMID23978506Line42 It contains three critical domains : JH1 , JH2 , and four - pointone , <font color="blue">ezrin</font> , <font color="blue">radixin</font> , moesin ( FERM ) homolog domains . <br>
PMID10706759Line63 Sequencing analysis of the aberrant fragments of the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene revealed the existence of eight types of RT - PCR products with losses of various exons of the published <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> sequence from exons 1 - 9 ( Fig . 2 ) . <br>
PMID22210327Line54 <font color="blue">BCORL1a</font> ( an alternatively spliced form of <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> ) contains additional 74 amino acids ( for a total of 1785 ) encoded by a further exon ( exon 9 ) . <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> localize in different subnuclear structures . Shown in the <font color="blue">Bcor</font> murine ortholog ; <font color="blue">MLLT3</font> is also known as <font color="blue">AF9</font> and is a fusion partner of <font color="blue">MLL</font> in acute leukemias . Direct or indirect . <br>
PMID22323480Line29 Analogous to previously applied strategies that identified <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , and other mutations , we have identified mutations affecting , in a recurrent fashion , genes of the spliceosome machinery , using a combination of targeted search approaches and unbiased mass sequencing . <br>
PMID22898539Line294 2 - HG , 2 hydroxyglutarate ; 5 - hmC , 5 - hydroxymethylcytosine ; 5 - mC , 5 - methylcytosine ; AML , acute myeloid leukaemia ; <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">additional sex combs - like 1</font> ; CMML , chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia ; CN - AML , cytogenetically normal AML ; CR , complete response ; <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">DNA methyltransferase 3A</font> ; <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">enhancer of zeste homologue 2</font> ; H3K4me3 , trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 ; HOX , homeobox ; HSC , haematopoietic stem cell ; IDH , isocitrate dehydrogenase ; LSK , lineage - <font color="blue">SCA1</font> + <font color="blue">KIT</font> + ; MDS , myelodysplastic syndrome ; <font color="blue">MLL</font> , <font color="blue">mixed - lineage leukaemia</font> ; MPN , myeloproliferative neoplasm ; OS , overall survival ; PMF , primary myelofibrosis ; PRC2 , Polycomb repressive complex 2 ; PTD , partial tandem - duplication ; <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2</font> . <br>
PMID23223431Line211 In support of this possibility , we found that both patients harbor heterozygous mutation of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>
PMID24986690Line139 However , the diverse mutations likely involve additional abnormalities in other metabolic pathways ; for instance , mutant <font color="blue">calreticulin</font> might have peculiar effects on megakaryocyte biology . <br>
PMID19282830Line147 We also analyzed whether the locations and patterns of mutations had any clinical or prognostic effect on patients with CMML harboring <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25006131Line150 In addition to clearly hypomorphic mutations , splice site mutations were also identified ( eg , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> 5 ' of exon 4 and 8 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line89 OS according to <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation status . <br>
PMID22210327Line29 Notably , the features of <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mutations in AML closely resembled those of the germline <font color="blue">BCOR</font> disruptive mutations causing the oculo - facio - cardio - dental ( OFCD ) X - linked syndrome that is characterized by microphtalmia , congenital cataracts , dysmorphic appearance , radiculomegaly , and digital and cardiac defects . <br>
PMID25465125Line237 Recent studies suggest that the presence of <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutation may be higher in MDS patients harboring a deletion of del ( 20q ) ( 20 % ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line102 As the main catalytic molecule of the PRCs , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( enhancer of zeste homologue 2 ) is responsible for mono - , di - , and trimethylation of H3K27 . <br>
PMID23223431Line158 She had a large monoallelic deletion of 61 kb ( Chr3 : 128 . 17 - 128 . 23 Mb ) completely encompassing <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and 2 other genes , <font color="blue">DNAJB8</font> and <font color="blue">LOC90246</font> ( supplemental Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line55 Although <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> truncation mutations may exhibit sensitivity to JAK kinase inhibition in the context of high concentrations of the <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ligand , downstream signaling operates predominantly through <font color="blue">SRC</font> kinases and exhibits drug sensitivity to <font color="blue">SRC</font> kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib . <br>
PMID23896413Line88 The <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutants disrupt this consensus b - TrCP motif , leading to increased <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> and <font color="blue">SET</font> expression , which lowers <font color="blue">PP2A</font> activity and increases proliferation of cells . <br>
PMID19282830Line86 The correlation between cooperating mutations and AML transformation is also shown in Table 1 . Only one patient harboring a C - terminal mutation ( no . 30 ) had a cooperating mutation with <font color="blue">NRAS</font> ( Gly12Asp ) . <br>
PMID25006131Line134 We were unable to find any correlation between <font color="blue">RAD21</font> and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> expression or between mutational status and expression in our patient cohorts , suggesting that this interaction in humans may be subject to pathway redundancy . <br>
PMID23619563Line117 The current study identifies mutations and mutational combinations that have clinical and prognostic correlates in PMF and could eventually prove useful for advancing the understanding of disease mechanisms , as suggested by the association of a specific gene expression signature in the <font color="blue">CD34</font> + cells of an exploratory cohort of subjects with their mutational asset . <br>
PMID20601954Line26 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations were not detected in subject 103 , but a homozygous missense mutation was present in subject 97 ( Table 1 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line92 One study compared MDS and MPN with the corresponding secondary AMLs that had <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutation and identified the same <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutation in the antecedent disorder as in the secondary AML in all ten cases . <br>
PMID23978506Line18 The diagnostic value of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations in MPN is well established . <br>
PMID22898539Line247 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations are known to activate canonical cytokine signalling pathways through the phosphorylation of <font color="blue">STAT</font> proteins . <br>
PMID23978506Line27 Other hematological neoplasms ( eg , myelodysplastic syndrome , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia , and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ) may harbor <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations in low frequencies . <br>
PMID21605981Line188 The mechanism of this action seems to be the activation of SCL after the binding of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> to its promoter , and the embryonic retinoid - BMP - <font color="blue">GATA2</font> signaling pathway , that controls progenitor cell survival in primitive hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line319 In contrast , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression is associated with the more favorable subtypes of neuroblastoma . <br>

PMID23978506Line49 Although various <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations have been reported in exons 12 , 13 , 14 , and 15 , in the vast majority of the cases mutations are found in codon 617 , resulting in the replacement of the amino acid valine with phenylalanine [ V617F , alias <font color="blue">JAK2 NM _ 004972 . 3</font> : c . 1849G > T ( p .

PMID23223431Line116 Fourteen unrelated proband cases were selected for the presence of a neutropenia , a WHIM - like syndrome with possible evolution to MDS / AML , and their negativity for mutations of the major genes involved in congenital neutropenia ( <font color="blue">ELANE</font> , <font color="blue">CXCR4</font> , <font color="blue">SBDS</font> , and <font color="blue">G6PC3</font> ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line164 Figure 2 . Cumulative incidence of thrombosis in PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation . Vertical tick marks indicate right - censored patients . <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant patients had a higher incidence of thrombosis than those with <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation ( P = . 021 ) . This difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age ( SHR , 2 . 19 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 15 - 4 . 18 ; P = . 017 ) , the estimated risk of thrombosis being about 2 - fold in <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant compared with <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients . <br>

PMID22898539Line177 In addition , two recent reports found that the ( R ) - enantiomer of 2 - HG ( ( R ) - 2HG ) may actually serve as a cofactor for the activation of the EGLN family of prolyl hydroxylases ( <font color="blue">EGLN1</font> - 3 ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line21 Moreover , Yoshida et al analyzed 29 cases with different subtypes of myelodysplasia and identified mutations of multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery , including <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> , <font color="blue">SF3A1</font> and <font color="blue">PRPF40B</font> , in 16 cases . <br>
PMID22898539Line146 Consistent with the mouse data , <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations are seen in up to 50 % of cases of CMML . <br>
PMID24986690Line149 As illustrated in Figure 7 , at least 3 genetic subgroups should now be taken into account in the interpretation of results : <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> / <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutant , and triple - negative patients . <br>

PMID22323480Line129 For instance , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations were associated with defective splicing of intron 5 of <font color="blue">TET2</font> at both splice sites ( Figure 3A ; supplemental Figure 6 ) , whereas splicing of other <font color="blue">TET2</font> introns were less affected . <br>
PMID21714648Line18 Mutations in <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> are predictors of poor overall survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes , independently of established risk factors . <br>
PMID25465125Line48 The relationships between <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations and other somatic events have also been explored . <br>
PMID21605981Line184 During ontogeny of HSC , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> plays at least two functionally distinct roles : the production and expansion of HSC in aorta - - gonad - - mesonephros , and the proliferation and survival of HSC in adult bone marrow . <br>

PMID22878824Line106 Patients with a higher level of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations ( > 25 % ) had a significantly higher 5 - year OS rate compared with those with lower levels of mutations , which showed an OS rate similar to that of patients without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations ( 71 % vs . 37 % ; adjusted P = . 004 ) . <br>

PMID19282830Line24 Other genetic aberrations require identification . <font color="blue">Runt - related transcription factor 1</font> ( <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ) is essential for normal hematopoiesis and differentiation . <br>
PMID19282830Line146 Patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations had a trend of increased risk of AML transformation compared with that in mutation - negative patients , but the difference did not reach statistical significance . <br>
PMID19282830Line7 We examined <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in 81 patients with CMML at initial diagnosis . <br>
PMID22898539Line155 Mutations in <font color="blue">IDH1</font> were first identified in glioblastoma through whole - exome sequencing ; this led to the identification of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations in 12 % of 149 glioblastoma samples . <br>
PMID19282830Line138 There were no significant differences in the clinicohematological features between <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutationpositive and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutation - negative groups . <br>
PMID21605981Line67 Besides , mutations in sequences encoding the N - terminal transactivation domain of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> have been found in patients with Down syndrome who have a transient myeloproliferative disorder , a clonal disease that is characterized by immature megakaryoblasts in the fetal liver and peripheral blood , that can progress to acute megakaryocytic leukemia . <br>
PMID19282830Line30 To the best of our knowledge , this series is the largest one of CMML that has been examined for <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations and we showed a high frequency of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations occurring preferentially at RHD with nonsense or frameshift patterns . <br>
PMID22878824Line155 Both the NCCN and the European LeukemiaNet ( ELN ) classify patients with NK - AML and mutated <font color="blue">NPM1</font> or <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> ( without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD ) as having favorable risk . <br>
PMID25465125Line71 Thus , increased D - 2HG becomes a negative regulator of <font color="blue">TET2</font> ( an alphaKG - dependent enzyme ) , resulting in abnormalities in global DNA methylation . <br>
PMID21605981Line43 Germline deletion of the <font color="blue">Gata1</font> gene in mice leads to embryonic lethality caused by an arrest of erythroid development at the proerythroblast stage , providing direct evidence that <font color="blue">Gata1</font> is essential for erythropoiesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line65 These interactions can either involve only N - ZnF , as in the case of <font color="blue">FOG1</font> , or occur in collaboration with C - ZnF , for example , with Sp1 , <font color="blue">EKLF</font> and <font color="blue">GATA1</font> itself . <br>
PMID22878824Line111 Mutations in <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> have been reported in 7 % to 11 % of patients with AML ( or 13 % - 15 % of those with NK - AML ) and has been associated with a favorable outcome ( similar to patients with <font color="blue">CBF</font> translocations ) with regard to increased remission duration and OS outcomes compared with wild - type <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> . <br>
PMID20601954Line49 Subjects carrying 7 or 7q deletions showed a significantly worse survival compared to individuals without any <font color="blue">EZH2</font> abnormalities ( P < 0 . 001 ; Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line87 Immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by hybridization to DNA microarray chips ( MeDIP - chip ) revealed that AMLs with <font color="blue">DNMT3AR882</font> mutations had decreased methylation at 182 specific genomic loci compared with <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - wild - type AML . <br>
PMID21605981Line196 Taken together , it is likely that <font color="blue">NOTCH1</font> and / or <font color="blue">BMP4</font> - signaling pathways initiate <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and <font color="blue">FLI1</font> expression , which then autoregulate each other and combine to initiate SCL transcription ( Fig . 3 ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line42 This is most prominent for the association of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations with increased ring sideroblasts . <br>

PMID22323480Line110 In contrast , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations were most frequent in the high - risk MDS / AML cohort ( 11 % ) , whereas <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> was most frequently mutated in MDS / MPN ( 24 % ) particularly in CMML ( 28 % ; Figure 2A ) . <br>
PMID21714648Line94 Mutations of <font color="blue">TET2</font> were overrepresented in samples with normal cytogenetic features ( P = 0 . 005 ) ( Table 7 in the Supplementary Appendix ) , whereas <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutations were strongly associated with a complex karyotype ( P < 0 . 001 ) . <br>

PMID23896413Line97 The discovery of high - frequency <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations in CNL , and to a lesser extent in aCML , identifies a new major diagnostic criterion for these diseases and suggests a close relationship between these neutrophilic leukemias . <br>

PMID21605981Line171 Recently , two studies have shown that <font color="blue">GATA1</font> regulates erythropoiesis by controlling miRNAs . <br>
PMID21605981Line282 Functional studies showed that the L359V mutant resulted in enhanced <font color="blue">GATA2</font> transactivation activity , and that both <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations repressed <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> activity via aberrant protein - protein interaction . <br>

PMID19282830Line112 The low frequencies of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in the earlier studies were probably attributed to different patient populations along with the limited exons analyzed as well as the small number of CMML patients examined . <br>
PMID21339759Line37 In more detail , we observed 10 novel different <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations in nine patients : 6 missense , 3 frameshifts ( 2 deletions , 1 insertion ) and 1 splice mutation ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line138 Recent observations indicate that the JAK - <font color="blue">STAT</font> ( Janus kinase - signal transducer and activator of transcription ) pathway is activated in all MPNs regardless of founding driver mutations . <br>

In low - risk MDS , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were most frequent among the 3 genes . In particular , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> was mutated in 15 of 20 cases of RARS ( 60 % ) . In the high - risk MDS and AML group , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations were most frequent ( 15 of 139 ; 10 . 8 % ) . In the MDS / MPN group , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> was most frequently mutated ( 13 of 46 ; 28 . 2 % ) , whereas <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> is mutated at a high frequency in RARS - T ( 10 of 11 ; 90 . 1 % ) . ( B ) Effect of spliceosomal mutations on clinical outcomes . In the entire cohort , patients with <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations ( MT ) had worse OS , compared with WT , but <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations made OS significantly shorter . In low - risk MDS , mutation of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> was a good prognostic factor , but <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations are associated with worse prognosis . In MDS / MPN , patients with mutated <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> had a shorter OS , but <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were associated with significantly better prognosis . In addition , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations did not affect outcomes . <br>
PMID25465125Line38 <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations are primarily located in conserved functional domains and the N terminus that predict a loss - of - function . <br>

PMID23978506Line8 Based on the current practice pattern and the literature , this Special Article provides recommendations and guidelines for laboratory practice for detection of mutations in the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> genes , including clinical manifestations for prompting the mutation analysis , current and recommended methodologies for testing the mutations , and standardization for reporting the test results . <br>
PMID21605981Line233 In mice , loss of <font color="blue">Gata1</font> expression in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages leads to markedly increased <font color="blue">Gata2</font> mRNA levels , reflecting the role of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> as a critical repressor of the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus . <br>
PMID23978506Line156 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> Sanger sequencing assays , such as those for exon 12 mutations , should report any detected mutations using standard Human Genome Variation Society ( HGVS ) nucleotide and amino acid nomenclature ( HGVS , http : / / www . hgvs . org / mutnomen , last accessed February 19 , 2013 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line231 <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> / <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> . <br>
PMID24986690Line82 In fact , when comparing <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant and <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients , the subdistribution hazard ratio ( SHR ) was 2 . 19 ( 95 % CI , 1 . 15 - 4 . 18 , P = . 017 ) , indicating that the risk of thrombosis was about twofold in the former . <br>
PMID23531518Line117 Of these , mutations involving <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> have been associated with poor outcomes . <br>
PMID25465125Line49 Several studies have confirmed that , unlike mutations in splicing and cytokine signaling , mutual exclusivity is not seen between <font color="blue">TET2</font> and other epigenetic modifiers ; <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations appear to co - occur within the landscape of genetic events and are also frequently found in samples with normal cytogenetic features ( P = 0 . 005 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line73 These truncated receptors may also lack the binding site for <font color="blue">suppressor of cytokine signaling 3</font> , which reduces trafficking of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> to the lysosome . <br>
PMID23978506Line59 The <font color="blue">MPL</font> gene maps to chromosome band 1p34 and encodes the thrombopoietin receptor , which binds to thrombopoietin , the primary cytokine that regulates megakaryocyte development and platelet production , as well as hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis . <br>

PMID23978506Line199 The participating laboratories tested the samples using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assays for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations , and several of the laboratories also performed <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation assays . <br>
PMID24335498Line41 In the subgroup of cytogenetically normal AML ( CN - AML ) , additional mutation analyses were performed for <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , <font color="blue">MLL</font> - <font color="blue">PTD</font> , <font color="blue">WT1</font> , and <font color="blue">WT1</font> SNP rs16754 , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , and expression levels of <font color="blue">BAALC</font> , <font color="blue">ERG</font> , <font color="blue">EVI1</font> , <font color="blue">MN1</font> , <font color="blue">MLL5</font> , and <font color="blue">WT1</font> were quantified as previously described using complementary DNA from the KG1A cell line ( <font color="blue">BAALC</font> , <font color="blue">ERG</font> , <font color="blue">MLL5</font> ) , plasmids ( <font color="blue">MN1</font> , <font color="blue">WT1</font> ) , or from a patient sample ( <font color="blue">EVI1</font> ) to construct a relative standard curve using ABL as a housekeeping gene ( Ipsogen , Marseille , France ) . <br>
PMID23223431Line24 In addition to <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> and <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , mutations in the <font color="blue">telomerase RNA</font> ( <font color="blue">TERC</font> ) or reverse transcriptase ( <font color="blue">TERT</font> ) subunits have also been identified . <br>

PMID23531518Line120 In CMML , ~ 40 % of patients have <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations , with the most frequent aberration being c . 1934dupG ; p . Gly646TrpfsX12 . <br>
PMID20601954Line45 In five out of eight subjects with an <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutation , a <font color="blue">TET2</font> was present ( ref . 3 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . <br>
PMID23531518Line126 Similarly , as published by our group before , spliceosome component mutations involving <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> are common in CMML , and do not have an impact on either the OS or the leukemia free survival . <br>
PMID24986690Line70 On the opposite , triple - negative patients were more likely to develop anemia compared with either <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant ( P < . 001 ) or <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant subjects ( P = . 013 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line183 Moreover , haploinsufficiency of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in adult mice results in abnormal HSC homeostasis . <br>
PMID23896413Line59 Further investigation in clinical trial settings will be required to determine whether JAK kinase inhibition in the setting of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation will lead to greater decreases in mutation allele burden compared with the responses observed in the setting of JAK2V617F . <br>
PMID23896413Line102 CNL may be the archetype of an MPN whose pathogenesis is predominantly characterized by mutations of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> , whereas aCML may be more genetically heterogeneous . <br>
PMID23978506Line191 It may be difficult to accumulate <font color="blue">JAK2</font> exon 12 or <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutant cases for validation , given the low frequency of these variants . <br>
PMID21605981Line140 <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and SCL / <font color="blue">E2A</font> mediate the anchoring of these proteins to the DNA , while <font color="blue">LMO2</font> bridged them together . <br>
PMID22878824Line112 However , as a caveat , a recent study indicated that the OS benefit with <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> was observed for patients with double mutations of <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> but not for those with a single mutation of the gene ; the 8 - year OS rates reported in this study for patients with double - mutated <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , single mutation of <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , and wild - type gene were 54 % , 31 % , and 34 % , respectively . <br>
PMID21605981Line66 Most mutations within the N - ZnF of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> disrupt its interaction with <font color="blue">FOG1</font> and are associated with several human hematological disorders , including dyserythropoietic anemia , thrombocytopenia , and beta - thalassemia . <br>

PMID19282830Line91 No differences were observed with respect to sex , blood counts , percentage of blasts in blood , subtype of CMML , cytogenetic risk group or International Prognostic Scoring System between CMML patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations and those without mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line264 Although the ATRA - insensitive <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha oncoprotein also interacts with the PRC2 complex , <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha also interacts with <font color="blue">PRC1</font> via its direct association with <font color="blue">BMI1</font> ( REF . 98 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line88 The role of follow - up testing for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations after therapy is not clearly established . <br>
PMID23054646Line37 In contrast , mutations of <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> on X chromosome were distributed along the entire coding region . <br>
PMID21339759Line31 Therefore , we investigated <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> exon 12 mutations in 79 / 81 cases ( no DNA available in two cases ) . <br>

PMID25006131Line86 Among <font color="blue">SMC3</font> alterations , 8 out of 19 were nonsense ( n = 1 ) , frameshift ( n = 1 ) , or splice site ( n = 6 ) mutations , whereas 11 out of 19 were missense mutations . <br>
PMID25465125Line174 The presence of <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutation has an independently negative impact on prognosis for all subtypes of MDS , with a hazard ratio for death from any cause of 2 . 48 ( 95 % CI , 1 . 60 - 3 . 84 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line191 An in vitro study also demonstrated that a transduction of <font color="blue">C - CBL</font> mutants into <font color="blue">c - CBL</font> ( - / - ) hematopoietic stem cells increased their senilities to stimulation of ligands ( e . g . , <font color="blue">interleukin 3</font> , <font color="blue">FLT3LG</font> ( <font color="blue">FLT3</font> ligand ) , <font color="blue">thrombopoietin</font> , and stem cell factor ) and had a long - term repopulating capacity . <br>

PMID24986690Line122 The diversity of PMF subtypes was not fully appreciated as long as the only known mutant genes associated with this condition were <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> , as illustrated in Figure 7 . <br>
PMID25465125Line136 Translocation is the most common genetic aberration identified in <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , for which approximately 30 partner genes have been reported and molecularly characterized . <br>
PMID23531518Line79 Because of the question on whether c . 1934dupG ; p . Gly646TrpfsX12 is truly an <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> gene mutation vs a somatic alteration , we reanalyzed the entire cohort , excluding the 47 patients with this mutation and found no difference in our results ( Supplementary figure one ) . <br>
PMID25006131Line61 Cutoffs for low expression of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> was considered the bottom 7 . 5 % transcript levels , and high expressors were considered the top 25 % . <br>

PMID10706759Line97 This result is different from Sakai ' s study of lymphoid neoplasms , in which the abnormalities of the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene may contribute to pathogenesis in a small percentage of malignant lymphoma . <br>
PMID21605981Line168 In these regions , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> can be ubiquitinated at least when exogenously expressed in cells . <br>
PMID20601954Line58 Together with our data , this suggests that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> may act as a tumor suppressor . <br>

PMID22035746Line138 In patients with both anemia and splenomegaly , <font color="blue">erythropoietin</font> stimulating agents are not recommended because increased extramedullary hematopoesis can lead to worsening splenomegaly . <br>
PMID21605981Line174 There are no studies about miRNAs and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in human models , although databases present many potential miRNAs with predicted binding sites in the 3 ' UTR of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>

PMID22898539Line120 These data suggest that <font color="blue">TET2</font> can function as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in most patients ; biallelic <font color="blue">TET2</font> inactivation occurs in < 10 % of patients with leukaemia . <br>
PMID22323480Line100 On the basis of the initial screen , we noted that mutations in <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> were the most frequent . <br>
PMID25006131Line160 The strong association with <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> indicates that epigenetic dysregulation may be synergistic in the mechanism of action exerted by cohesin haploinsufficiency . <br>
PMID21605981Line186 Moreover , a recent study demonstrated that high <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression in human HSCs and HPCs confers increased quiescence , an important hallmark property of HSCs . <br>
PMID24335498Line155 It could be possible that a negative prognostic impact of cohesin mutations might have been missed because of the favorable prognostic impact of <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations and the strong association between these mutations . <br>

PMID19282830Line84 Cooperating mutations of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> and RAS genes were also analyzed in CMML patients harboring <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations ( Table 1 ) ; one patient had <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD ( Asp835Tyr ) , three patients had <font color="blue">NRAS</font> mutations and one had a <font color="blue">KRAS</font> mutation . <br>
PMID21605981Line234 Besides , despite a 5 - fold increase in <font color="blue">Gata2</font> mRNA , primary purified <font color="blue">GATA1</font> - deficient megakaryocytes manifest multiple abnormalities in growth control and differentiation . <br>
PMID23978506Line82 In practice , however , clinicians find it easier to order both the <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> and the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> assays at the same time in screening peripheral blood . <br>
PMID23896413Line65 Mutations in <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> have previously been identified in patients with severe congenital neutropenia ( SCN ) . <br>
PMID21339759Line18 A sequencing library was prepared for hotspot regions of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ( exon 4 ) , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ( exon 4 ) , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> ( exon 11 ) and the complete coding region of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , comprising a total of 22 amplicons with a median size of 336 bp . <br>
PMID25006131Line180 Figure 3 . Effect of cohesin mutational status on OS in MDS . Kaplan - Meier curves for patients with MDS are shown for ( A ) <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutant patients and cohesin WT patients and ( B ) all cohesin mutant patients vs WT cohesin patients . Median OS of MDS patients with a <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation was 35 months vs 50 months ( P = . 17 ; HR : 1 . 8 CI [ 1 . 1 - 3 . 1 ] ) , median survival for cohesin mutant MDS cases was inferior to WT MDS cases ( 34 . 2 vs 48 . 2 ; P = . 21 ) , and a significant survival difference was pronounced in patients with MDS who survived for at least 12 months ( P = . 01 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line119 Importantly , most <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations are heterozygous in leukaemia , and the expression of the wild - type allele is retained . <br>
PMID23531518Line85 There was no statistically significant difference , among the three mutation groups ( <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> vs <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> vs <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> ) , in prognostically relevant parameters . <br>
PMID24986690Line65 Within 140 <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients , 101 ( 72 % ) had the 52 - bp deletion ( L367fs * 46 , type 1 mutation ) , 22 ( 16 % ) had the 5 - bp insertion ( K385fs * 47 , type 2 mutation ) , and 17 ( 12 % ) carried other less frequent indels . <br>
PMID21605981Line180 6 . 1 . ROLE OF <font color="blue">GATA2</font> IN HEMATOPOIETIC STEM AND PROGENITOR CELLS . <br>
PMID10706759Line100 However , due to the small number cases of our study and AML is a wide diversity disease which may differ in etiology , pathology , and behavior , the potential role of <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> in AML or in some subtypes of AML need further investigation . <br>
PMID22898539Line239 Notably , somatic mutations in <font color="blue">BAP1</font> , a binding partner of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and a probable antagonist of <font color="blue">PRC1</font> activity , have been described in mesothelioma , melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but not to date in haematopoietic malignancies . <br>
PMID23531518Line78 Thirty - seven ( 42 % ) , 13 ( 14 % ) and 2 ( 2 % ) patients had concomitant <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> and <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations , respectively . <br>
PMID23619563Line10 However , only <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations ( HR : 2 . 02 ; P < 0 . 001 ) remained significant in the context of the International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line109 Clinically , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations are also prognostically relevant in both low - and high - risk MDS and are associated with a worse OS compared with non - mutated <font color="blue">EZH2</font> . <br>
PMID25006131Line127 We also investigated expression signatures of genes associated with cohesin mutations or with reduced expression of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> / <font color="blue">RAD21</font> / <font color="blue">SMC3</font> . <br>
PMID23223431Line65 Five were confirmed by classic Sanger sequencing : <font color="blue">EPHB6</font> T483P , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> R396Q , <font color="blue">IMPG2</font> P1161L , <font color="blue">NEK11</font> D87Y , and <font color="blue">TTN</font> P4737R ( primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1 , available on the Blood Web site ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line28 Because <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations are not completely specific for MPN , finding of these mutations in isolation does not warrant a diagnosis of MPN . <br>
PMID23978506Line62 The mutation W515L represents guanosine - to - thymidine substitution in <font color="blue">MPL</font> at nucleotide 1544 , which leads to exchange of leucine for tryptophan . <br>
PMID25465125Line56 <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations were first reported in myeloid leukemias . <br>
PMID21605981Line86 Using a cis - element knockout approach , it has been demonstrated that the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> - 1 . 8 kb site is selectively required to maintain <font color="blue">Gata2</font> repression in late - stage erythroblasts in vivo . <br>
PMID21605981Line303 9 . OTHER IMPORTANT ROLES OF <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line74 To determine the expression levels of <font color="blue">EVI1</font> , relative quantification was calculated using the equation 2 - Delta Delta Ct , as previously described . <br>
PMID21605981Line88 This comparison between the - 2 . 8 kb and - 1 . 8 kb sites illustrates how GATA motifs function uniquely and collectively to achieve complex and dynamic transcriptional control at the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus during hematopoietic development . <br>
PMID23531518Line118 The <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( additional sex combs like 1 ) gene , contains 12 exons and maps to chromosome 20q11 , regulating epigenetic functions and transcription . <br>
PMID21714648Line15 In a multivariable Cox regression model , the presence of mutations in five genes retained independent prognostic significance : <font color="blue">TP53</font> ( hazard ratio for death from any cause , 2 . 48 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1 . 60 to 3 . 84 ) , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( hazard ratio , 2 . 13 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 36 to 3 . 33 ) , <font color="blue">ETV6</font> ( hazard ratio , 2 . 04 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 08 to 3 . 86 ) , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ( hazard ratio , 1 . 47 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 01 to 2 . 15 ) , and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( hazard ratio , 1 . 38 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 00 to 1 . 89 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line170 <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutations are ubiquitously mutated in human cancers and have been clearly identified to be oncogenic . <br>
PMID25006131Line118 Three AML cases with cohesin mutations ( <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> ) at diagnosis achieved remission with cytarabine and idarubicin treatment . <br>
PMID10706759Line72 A total of 20 AML patients were analyzed for LOH using four microsatellite markers near or within the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene locus . <br>
PMID25465125Line104 The prevalence of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations in MDS is variable . <br>
PMID21339759Line60 We suggest , therefore , that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutational status should be taken into account in future clinical studies of CMML . <br>
PMID23054646Line50 <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> has also been implicated in genetic stability , and its defect could lead to hypermutability . <br>
PMID25465125Line36 Somatic <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations were initially reported in myeloid neoplasms , including MDS in 2009 . <br>
PMID22878824Line103 The <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations predominantly occur independently of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , and most frequently involve mutations in the D835 residue of a tyrosine kinase domain . <br>
PMID23223431Line204 The main genes involved in congenital neutropenia were characterized during the last decade , with <font color="blue">ELANE</font> being involved in half of them ( for review , see Donadieu et al ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line140 In addition to the 23 somatic mutations , we identified 3 SNPs ( 2 in <font color="blue">STAG1</font> and 1 in <font color="blue">RAD21</font> ) , which have not been described by dbSNP and were not found in mononuclear cells of 30 healthy donors . <br>
PMID22323480Line147 The prognostic effect of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations has been investigated in several studies . <br>
PMID24986690Line5 We studied the impact of driver mutations of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , ( <font color="blue">calreticulin</font> gene ) or <font color="blue">MPL</font> on clinical course , leukemic transformation , and survival of patients with primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) . <br>
PMID23223431Line118 In 2 of these 6 pedigrees ( P3 and P4 , Figure 1 ) , we identified a <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation in 4 affected relatives , 1 in P3 and 3 in P4 . <br>
PMID22898539Line105 Initial studies of the role of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> in mouse haematopoiesis demonstrated no overt phenotype unless both <font color="blue">Dnmt3a</font> and <font color="blue">Dnmt3b</font> were lost . <br>
PMID25006131Line182 Figure 5 . Analysis of cohesin expression identifies a discrete subset of low expressors . ( A ) Expression of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> in MDS and pAML subtypes . A discrete subset of patients exhibit low <font color="blue">STAG2</font> expression defined as < 2 standard deviations below the mean as compared with 17 healthy donors . This was more prevalent in patients with highrisk MDS and non - core binding factor AML without complex cytogenetics . ( B ) Percent of low expressors in cohesin genes . The frequency of cohesin low expressors for each cohesin complex gene ( <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , <font color="blue">RAD21</font> , <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , <font color="blue">STAG1</font> , and <font color="blue">PDS5B</font> ) is shown by disease subtype . <font color="blue">STAG2</font> was most commonly underexpressed in high - risk MDS , whereas <font color="blue">RAD21</font> was most commonly underexpressed in the remaining myeloid malignancies . SD , standard deviation . <br>
PMID21339759Line48 However , with respect to the clinical data , a poor outcome was observed for patients that carried <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations compared with <font color="blue">EZH2</font> wild - type cases ( alive at 3 years : 33 . 3 versus 69 . 9 % ; P = 0 . 001 ) as shown in Figure 1b . <br>
PMID22375971Line27 Although the gain - of - function mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase ( JAK ) 2 ( <font color="blue">JAK2V617F</font> ) is present in approximately 50 % of patients with primary myelofibrosis , other mechanisms of direct or indirect activation of the intracellular JAK - signal transducer and activator of transcription ( <font color="blue">STAT</font> ) pathway are known , suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway is a central pathogenic component in myelofibrosis , regardless of the mutational status of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> . <br>
PMID22210327Line32 <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> somatic mutations were found in about 6 % of a series of 173 AML patients which included cases with secondary leukemia ( showing myelodysplasia - related changes or being therapy - related ) and a high incidence ( approx . 65 % ) of abnormal karyotypes . <br>
PMID21605981Line326 In this regard , it is hoped that further extensive studies in <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> - related leukemias could contribute to the development of new therapies for human leukemia . <br>
PMID22898539Line234 ChIP for <font color="blue">EZH2</font> in the presence and absence of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> revealed that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> recruitment was markedly reduced in the absence of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , suggesting that <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> may be important for the recruitment and / or stability of the PRC2 complex in myeloid haematopoietic cells . <br>
PMID22898539Line237 Haematopoietic - specific conditional alleles are needed to delineate the effects of somatic <font color="blue">Asxl1</font> loss in the haematopoietic compartment ; preliminary studies suggest that these mice develop myeloid neoplasms that are most similar to human MDS in vivo . <br>
PMID25465125Line220 Patients whose MDS harbors <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations often have a higher platelet count , increased ring sideroblasts , fewer cytopenias , and lower blast count , when compared with patients without <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID23054646Line43 <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were found in 68 - 82 % of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts ( RSRS ) and 57 - 76 % of refractory cytopenia with ring sideroblasts ( RCMD - RS ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line185 The optimism for targeted <font color="blue">JAK2</font> tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been tempered with increasing data to suggest that the oncogenic role of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations may be more complex than for <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> in CML . <br>
PMID22898539Line78 A subsequent study of 489 AML samples also found that <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations conferred poor prognosis and decreased overall survival . <br>
PMID25465125Line182 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation has been identified in <font color="blue">BCR</font> - ABL - negative myeloproliferative neoplasm , myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms ( e . g . , RARS - T ) , and a subset of MDS with 5q - . <br>
PMID22898539Line297 Box 1 . Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and transformation of chronic myeloid malignancies Myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPNs ) are clonal disorders of haematopoiesis that are characterized by an accumulation of mature - appearing cells in the bloodstream and include the <font color="blue">breakpoint cluster region</font> ( <font color="blue">BCR</font> ) - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - translocated disorder chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) , as well as the ' classic ' <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPNs polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocytosis ( ET ) and primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) . Patients with CML or with <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative classic MPNs are at increased risk of leukaemic transformation , which is associated with dismal clinical prognosis . Prior work identifying the role of <font color="blue">nucleoporin 98</font> ( <font color="blue">NUP98</font> ) - homeobox A9 ( <font color="blue">HOXA9</font> ) translocations as well as the overexpression of <font color="blue">musashi homologue 2</font> ( <font color="blue">MSI2</font> ) following the leukaemic transformation of CML suggested a potential role for alterations in genetic regulators of HOXA cluster genes in leukaemic transformation of MPNs . Notably , mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> ( REFS 29 , 103 - 105 ) and <font color="blue">isocitrate dehydrogenase 1</font> ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ) and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ( REFS 106 , 107 ) occur in a significant subset of patients with MPN that undergoes leukaemic transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) ( see the table ) . Although there is evidence that <font color="blue">TET2</font> may regulate the HOXA cluster , more work needs to be done to determine its functional relevance in disease transformation . The most common genetic alterations identified in AMLs that have developed from chronic myeloid malignancies include mutations in epigenetic modifying genes as well as genes without known direct chromatin - modifying functions such as <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , Wilms tumour 1 ( <font color="blue">WT1</font> ) and <font color="blue">runt - related transcription factor 1</font> ( <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ) . Further comprehensive genomic and epigenomic characterization of paired chronic - and leukaemic - phase patient samples will be needed to further elucidate the mechanisms of transformation from MPN or myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) to AML , and how these alterations compare to those observed in classical , de novo AML . <br>
PMID22898539Line165 Mutational and methylation studies of a large cohort of patients with AML demonstrated that IDH mutations and <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations are mutually exclusive in AML , and patients with mutations in either <font color="blue">TET2</font> , or <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> share similar methylation profiles that are characterized by global promoter hypermethylation . <br>
PMID22323480Line13 <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations are prevalent in low - risk MDS with ring sideroblasts , whereas <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and advanced forms of MDS . <br>
PMID23896413Line84 <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations in aCML were associated with higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis and poorer survival . <br>
PMID21605981Line285 Our group has also analyzed a series of 225 samples from patients with AML and found no <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in any sample , confirming this result . <br>
PMID23223431Line27 Heterozygous point mutations located in the second zinc finger of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> have been identified initially in 4 families with MDS and AML . <br>

The thresholds for hemoglobin level and WBC count are those of the IPSS , whereas that for PLT count is the lower limit of normal range . Cumulative incidences were estimated with a competing risk approach , considering death for any cause as a competing event . Vertical tick marks indicate right - censored patients . ( A ) Cumulative incidence of anemia ( hemoglobin < 10 g / dL ) . <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had a lower incidence of anemia compared with the remaining patients ( maximum P value equal to . 004 ) .

The cumulative incidence of thrombocytopenia was significantly lower in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients compared with the remaining ones ( P = . 001 in all comparisons ) . ( C ) Cumulative incidence of marked leukocytosis ( WBC count > 25 x 109 / L ) . The cumulative incidence of marked leukocytosis was significantly lower in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients compared with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant ( P = . 004 ) or triple - negative patients ( P = . 001 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line96 A single <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation , which localizes to the cytoplasm , confers a higher complete response ( CR ) rate and improved event - free survival ( EFS ) and OS compared with patients with NK - AML with wild - type <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , resulting in outcomes similar to patients with favorable cytogenetics ( eg , <font color="blue">CBF</font> AML ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line187 Thus , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is crucial for the proliferation and expansion of HSC and progenitor cells . <br>
PMID23223431Line95 A global immunologic defect was identified with a very low number of <font color="blue">CD14</font> + monocytes , <font color="blue">CD19</font> + B - cell lymphocytes , and CD3 - / <font color="blue">CD56</font> + NK cells , along with a normal CD3 + T - cell lymphocyte count ( supplemental Table 2 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line137 The most common partner gene is <font color="blue">EVI</font> , as evidenced by the t ( 3 ; 12 ) ( q26 ; p13 ) / <font color="blue">EVI</font> - <font color="blue">ETV6</font> ( <font color="blue">TEL</font> ) translocation , which was initially reported in 4 patients with MDS / AML and 1 patient with CML in blast phase . <br>
PMID20601954Line55 Notably , the SET domain , essential for the methyltransferase activity of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( refs . 8 - 10 ) , was either altered or truncated in at least one allele in all affected subjects ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line116 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutation was found to occur concurrently with NK - AML and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID23619563Line14 Mutational profiling for <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and IDH identifies PMF patients who are at risk for premature death or leukemic transformation . <br>
PMID22035746Line155 The most promising <font color="blue">JAK2</font> inhibitors are TG101348 and INCB018424 . <br>
PMID22878824Line152 Similarly , the benefit in OS outcomes seen with <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> mutations seems to be lost in the presence of concurrent <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD . <br>
PMID25465125Line213 <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations have been commonly identified in MDS ( 20 % , 72 of 354 patients ) , with particularly high frequency in patients with ring sideroblasts ( 65 % ) and less commonly in other WHO subtypes . <br>
PMID21605981Line110 Nichols et al described a family with X - linked dyserythropoietic anemia and thrombocytopenia due to a substitution of methionine for valine at amino acid 205 of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line14 Previously identified mutations , such as <font color="blue">janus kinase 2</font> ( <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ) - V617F and fusion proteins involving translocation of the <font color="blue">promyelocytic leukaemia</font> ( <font color="blue">PML</font> ) gene , also contribute to epigenetic modifications in myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID23619563Line86 Prognostic significance was sustained for all but <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations in multivariable analysis that included all four mutations . <br>
PMID23223431Line64 Single - nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) were filtered using COSMIC v53 and dbSNP135 databases for nonsynonymous variants with a reading call higher than 5 , leading to the identification of 8 SNVs : <font color="blue">EPHB6</font> T483P , ERN V458G , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> R396Q , <font color="blue">IMPG2</font> P1161L , <font color="blue">KDM5C</font> V858G , <font color="blue">MAST4</font> K2422E , <font color="blue">NEK11</font> D87Y , and <font color="blue">TTN</font> P4737R . <br>
PMID24335498Line82 The most commonly mutated gene in this complex was <font color="blue">STAG1</font> with 7 patients harboring a mutation in this gene . <br>
PMID23978506Line183 As reference standards for quantitative <font color="blue">JAK2</font> testing are made available , comparable results across laboratories can be achieved in monitoring treatment response and minimal residual disease . <br>
PMID20601954Line57 Recently , a recurring monoallelic <font color="blue">EZH2</font> point mutation in the SET domain ( Tyr641 ; Tyr646 in <font color="blue">NM _ 004456 . 3</font> ) leading to loss of function has been described in lymphomas . <br>
PMID22898539Line192 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> is an H3K27 methyltransferase . <br>
PMID25465125Line172 A larger study leveraged next - generation sequencing technology and determined the overall rate of <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutations to be 7 . 5 - 9 . 4 % , with a much higher incidence in patients with isolated del ( 5q ) ( 19 % ) as well as in those with complex cytogenetic abnormalities including monosomy 5 and / or del ( 5q ) ( 72 % ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line125 Additionally , 5 - hmC may lead to passive demethylation as <font color="blue">DNMT1</font> is unable to recognize 5 - hmC ; methylation marks thus become lost in succeeding DNA replication cycles , as newly incorporated cytosines in the daughter strand fail to become methylated . <br>
PMID24986690Line123 The identification of somatic mutations of <font color="blue">calreticulin</font> has substantially modified our knowledge of PMF . <br>
PMID22898539Line103 Gene set enrichment analysis of expression data from <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - mutant compared with <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - wild - type AML patient samples identified altered expression of genes in key metabolic and apoptosis pathways . <br>
PMID24986690Line26 In 2013 , somatic mutations of <font color="blue">CALR</font> , the gene encoding <font color="blue">calreticulin</font> , have been found in 20 % to 25 % of patients with essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) or PMF . <br>
PMID21605981Line131 Even <font color="blue">BRG1</font> is present at <font color="blue">GATA1</font> regulated genes prior to their activation by <font color="blue">GATA1</font> . <br>
PMID25006131Line129 We observed decreased expression of <font color="blue">DCK</font> and increased expression of UCK in patients with cohesin mutations or with nonmutational suppression of cohesin expression , indicating common alterations of downstream pathways ( supplemental Table 12 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line100 In a recent German study that included 305 MDS patients with del ( 20q ) , 16 . 3 % had the <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutation , which was associated with a shorter 2 - year survival rate . <br>
PMID25465125Line227 In another study , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations also co - occurred with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25465125Line127 <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> ( at Xp11 . 4 ) encode a protein that functions as the corepressor of <font color="blue">BCL6</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line180 Currently , mutations in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> or <font color="blue">TET2</font> seem to have clinical relevance to risk stratification and / or therapeutic relevance in patients with AML . <br>
PMID24335498Line92 Two patients with mutations in <font color="blue">STAG2</font> had missense mutations , 2 patients had frameshift mutations , and 1 patient had a nonsense mutation in this gene ( Figure 1 and supplemental Table 3 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line179 Below we will summarize some of the major functions of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in this biological process . <br>
PMID25465125Line229 Several studies have demonstrated an inferior overall survival in <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> - mutated myeloid neoplasms ( P = 0 . 01 ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line58 Disease phenotypes associated ET PMF with <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations include older age , female gender , lower hemoglobin level , and higher platelet count . <br>
PMID25465125Line158 <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations have also been demonstrated to occur at the time of disease transformation , suggesting that these mutations could be a mechanism that results in myeloid leukemic transformation from MDS and CMML . <br>
PMID23978506Line255 Table 2 . <font color="blue">MPL</font> Mutations in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms . <br>
PMID21605981Line195 Moreover , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> directly upregulates <font color="blue">BMP4</font> expression , binding to the regulatory elements present at the <font color="blue">BMP4</font> promoter . <br>
PMID22898539Line195 By contrast , the overexpression of wildtype <font color="blue">EZH2</font> is commonly observed in various epithelial malignancies , and increased <font color="blue">EZH2</font> expression has been shown to be caused , at least in part , by the loss of transcriptional repression by specific microRNAs including miR - 101 ( REF . 64 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line108 Figure 1 . Mutations in <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> and <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> are common in CNL and aCML . Percentages of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> , <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> , and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutations in 29 patients with CNL or aCML are shown . <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations arise in 2 classes , nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncate the cytoplasmic tail ( truncation mutations ) and point mutations in the extracellular domain ( membrane proximal mutation ) , and some cases exhibit both classes of mutations on the same allele ( compound mutations ) . These mutations can occur in isolation or in combination with other mutant genes , with 21 % of patients having both <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> and <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations . One patient exhibited mutations in both <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ( G683R ) and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) ; however , the clonality of this double mutation could not be established due to limited material , presenting the possibility of polyclonal populations of tumor cells with distinct mutational profiles . The frequencies of each class of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation alone or in combination with <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> or <font color="blue">JAK2</font> are shown for a combined cohort of CNL and aCML ( n = 29 ) , the CNL cases only ( n = 9 ) , and the aCML cases only ( n = 20 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line180 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( <font color="blue">Janus kinase 2</font> ) , located at 9p24 , belongs to the Janus kinase family and is the sentinel kinase in many hematopoietic signaling cascades . <br>
PMID22898539Line190 The mammalian <font color="blue">PRC1</font> complex is thought to be composed of only two core members consisting of <font color="blue">RING1A</font> and <font color="blue">RING1B</font> together with one of the following : <font color="blue">BMI1</font> , MEL18 ( also known as <font color="blue">PCGF2</font> ) or <font color="blue">NSPC1</font> ( also known as <font color="blue">PCGF1</font> ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line276 In patients with t ( 8 ; 21 ) , c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations were also associated with a higher incidence of relapse at 5 years ( 70 % vs . 36 % : P = . 017 ) , but no differences were observed in 5 - year OS ( 42 % vs . 48 % ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line79 4 . TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION OF <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>
PMID21714648Line138 Mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> had associations with clinical phenotypes , including overall survival , that differed from those of <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations , suggesting that these genes drive distinct and additive aspects of cellular transformation to myelodysplastic syndromes . <br>
PMID21605981Line62 At least 3 functional domains have been identified within the <font color="blue">GATA1</font> protein : the N - terminal transactivation domain , N - ZnF , and C - ZnF . <br>
PMID21605981Line264 Fujiwara et al used ChIP - sequencing to define <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> occupancy genome - wide in erythroid cells . <br>
PMID25465125Line185 Studies regarding the importance of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation in clinical outcomes in MDS are limited . <br>
PMID22323480Line143 A higher cross - sectional prevalence among advanced cases suggests that both <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> constitute high - risk defects . <br>
PMID24986690Line60 Presenting hematologic and clinical features of PMF patients according to <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation status Of the 617 patients studied , 399 ( 64 . 7 % ) carried <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) , 140 ( 22 . 7 % ) a <font color="blue">CALR</font> exon 9 indel , 25 ( 4 . 0 % ) an <font color="blue">MPL</font> ( W515 ) mutation , and 53 ( 8 . 6 % ) had nonmutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">MPL</font> , and <font color="blue">CALR</font> ( ie , triple - negative subjects ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line16 Patients with PMF may carry <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) , a <font color="blue">CALR</font> exon 9 indel , an <font color="blue">MPL</font> exon 10 mutation , or none of these genetic lesions . <br>
PMID23978506Line40 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> . <br>
PMID20601954Line62 We postulate that changes in epigenetic modifications caused by defective <font color="blue">EZH2</font> may result in tumor promotion by different mechanisms depending on the cellular context and the oncogenic pathways that are activated . <br>
PMID25465125Line125 Multivariate analysis has demonstrated that age , complex karyotype , <font color="blue">MLL</font> - PTD , and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations are independently associated with poorer prognosis in MDS , a finding confirmed in subsequent studies . <br>
PMID24986690Line11 In multivariate analysis corrected for age , <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had better overall survival than either <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant or triple - negative patients . <br>
PMID21605981Line98 In this process , <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> show dynamic changes in their expression profiles and these patterns are reciprocal during erythroid differentiation ( Fig . 2 ) . <br>
PMID20601954Line56 We conclude that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> is targeted by various types of deletions and mutations in MDS , probably leading to loss of function of the gene . <br>
PMID22210327Line33 Similarly to mutations of <font color="blue">BCOR</font> , most of the alterations affecting <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> were nonsense mutations , out - of - frame insertions / deletions or splice site mutations that , although not resulting in clearly diminished mRNA levels of <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> , were predicted to encode truncated proteins lacking the last C - terminal LXXLL nuclear receptor recruitment motif . <br>
PMID24335498Line94 In <font color="blue">RAD21</font> , we found 2 patients with missense mutations , 1 patient with a frameshift mutation , and 1 with a nonsense mutation ( Figure 1 and supplemental Table 5 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line104 We performed a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression considering type of mutation ( <font color="blue">CALR</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">MPL</font> , or none of the previous mutations ) and each single variable included in the IPSS score at diagnosis ( age > 65 years , hemoglobin < 10 g / dL , WBC count > 25 x 109 / L , peripheral blood blasts > = 1 % , and presence of constitutional symptoms ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line217 Although they present overlapping expression patterns , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is expressed in HSCs , early HPCs , as well as erythroid precursor cells , controlling early stages of hematopoiesis , whereas <font color="blue">GATA1</font> is required for terminal maturation . <br>
PMID22878824Line97 Two major classes of activating <font color="blue">FLT3</font> mutations have been identified in patients with AML , which include the internal tandem duplications ( ITD ) and tyrosine kinase domain ( TKD ) point mutations . <br>
PMID23978506Line15 In 2006 , mutations in a second gene , myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene ( <font color="blue">MPL</font> ) , were identified in both ET and PMF patients . <br>
PMID19282830Line69 Frequencies and patterns of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in patients with CMML . <br>
PMID22323480Line166 For <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> and <font color="blue">U2AF26</font> we found that accumulation of unspliced transcripts rather than abnormal alternative splicing is the main consequence of the mutations . <br>
PMID23978506Line64 This then leads to subsequent activation of downstream tyrosine kinases and activation of transcription factors <font color="blue">STAT3</font> and STAT5 , which in turn leads to transformation of hematopoietic cells into cytokine - independent clones , resulting in megakaryocytic hyperplasia and marrow fibrosis . <br>
PMID22323480Line178 Interestingly , spliceosome mutations , specific in <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , were reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia . <br>
PMID21605981Line139 Cooperativity between <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and SCL occurs at regulatory regions containing juxtaposed GATA and E - box elements that assemble higher order protein networks . <br>
PMID23896413Line101 These likely include patient genetic background , characteristics of the distinct <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation ( eg , hematopoietic cell of origin , allele burden , activation of distinct signaling cascades ) , and the accompanying clonal architecture of these neoplasms ( eg , mutations of <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F , or other genes ) . <br>
PMID22210327Line37 <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations mostly occurred in patients with s - AML and / or with abnormal karyotype , and carried germline <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> genes . <br>
PMID22878824Line296 In the latest versions of these guidelines , the panel has endeavored to incorporate emerging data on the influence of mutations in specific genes such as c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> , <font color="blue">FLT3</font> , <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> on subsets of patients within a cytogenetic category ( see " Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities , " on page 995 ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line31 Presence of mutational hot spot in <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , and <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> . <br>
PMID22878824Line91 These markers include <font color="blue">FMS - like tyrosine kinase 3</font> ( <font color="blue">FLT3</font> ) , c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> , nucleophosmin ( <font color="blue">NPM1</font> ) , and <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> gene mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line144 Several groups have generated mouse models of <font color="blue">TET2</font> loss , and in each study to date <font color="blue">TET2</font> loss resulted in disruption of haematopoietic differentiation with progressive expansion of the lineage - <font color="blue">SCA1</font> + <font color="blue">KIT</font> + ( LSK ) population , which includes HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells . <br>
PMID22898539Line194 To date , mutation or alterations in expression of <font color="blue">EZH1</font> have not been found in human malignancies . <br>
PMID21339759Line22 The hotspot region of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> exon 12 ( n = 6 amplicons ) was investigated by conventional Sanger sequencing using primer sequences as published by Gelsi - Boyer et al <br>
PMID22878824Line94 The 2 most frequent molecular lesions with prognostic impact in patients with AML are mutations of the <font color="blue">FLT3</font> gene ( 37 % - 46 % of patients ) encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in hematopoiesis , and mutations of the <font color="blue">NPM1</font> gene ( 28 % - 35 % ) encoding a shuttling protein within the nucleolus . <br>
PMID22898539Line200 In vitro analyses of several of these <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutants suggest that these mutations confer loss - of - function . <br>
PMID21605981Line157 Menghini et al presented evidence that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is phosphorylated and blocked by the PI3K / <font color="blue">Akt</font> signal transduction pathway , leading to an increase of adipose tissue differentiation and a reduction of adipose tissue - related inflammation . <br>
PMID23978506Line66 The majority of the <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations are found in exon 10 codon 515 ; W515L is the most common , followed by W515K . <br>
PMID24986690Line83 When taking into account the type of <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation , both patients with type 1 and those with type 2 mutation had a lower risk of thrombosis compared with patients carrying <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) ( P = . 042 and P = . 021 , respectively ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line185 Minegishi et al reported an inhibitory function of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in the differentiation of hematopoietic precursor cells , and suggested that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> may act to preserve the pool of immature cells . <br>
PMID21605981Line283 The mutation L359V of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> was found in about 10 % of the patients at the progression phase of chronic myeloid leukemia , including accelerated phase and blast crisis . <br>
PMID23223431Line104 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> and <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> were not mutated in any member of this family ( data not shown ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line69 The effect of the S34F and Q157P / R <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutants was also tested in competitive repopulation assays , in which highly purified mouse hematopoietic stem cells ( <font color="blue">CD34</font> - c - <font color="blue">Kit</font> + <font color="blue">ScaI</font> + Lin - ) were transduced with each mutant and together with normal competitors , transplanted into lethally irradiated mice . <br>
PMID22035746Line179 Karyotyping and cytogenic profiling is increasingly important in evaluating patients with <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPN . <br>
PMID25465125Line165 The identification of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in patients with mild chronic neutropenia subsequently evolving to MDS / AML suggests that it may be an early finding in disease initiation . <br>
PMID22035746Line206 Figure 1 . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) 2008 Classification of Myeloid Malignancies and Associated Genotypic Abnormalities : Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) ; Myelopreliferative Neoplasm Associated Esosinophilia ( MPN - eos ) ; Myelodysplatic Syndrome ( MDS ) . MDS / MPN Includes Subtypes Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia ( CMML ) , Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia ( JMML ) , Atypical Chronic Myeloid Leukemia - <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> Negative ( aCML ) , MDS / MPN Unspecified ( MDS / MPN - u ) , Which Includes the Refractory Anemia With Ring Sideblasts and Thrombocytosis ( RARS - T ) . MPN Includes Nonclassic Subtypes Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia ( CNL ) , Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia ( CEL ) , Systemic Mastocytosis ( SM ) , and MPN Unspecified ( MPN - u ) . Classic Subtypes Include Chronic Myeloid Leukemia - <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> positive ( CML ) , Polycythemia Vera ( PV ) , Essential Thrombocythemia ( ET ) , and Primary Myelofibrosis ( PMF ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line271 Consequently , one might predict that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and the SCL / <font color="blue">TAL1</font> complex commonly co - occupy and function through such composite elements in vivo . <br>
PMID22898539Line258 APL is a genetically distinct subtype of AML that is most commonly associated with a recurrent chromosomal translocation fusing the <font color="blue">promyelocytic leukaemia</font> ( <font color="blue">PML</font> ) gene to <font color="blue">retinoic acid receptor - alpha</font> ( <font color="blue">RARA</font> ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line86 If a diagnosis of PMF or ET is entertained , then <font color="blue">MPL</font> analysis should be performed in the setting of a negative <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F assay , if required to meet World Health Organization diagnostic criteria . <br>
PMID22035746Line65 Mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , <font color="blue">IKAROS</font> , and <font color="blue">LNK</font> genes have all been described with variable frequencies in MPN . <br>
PMID23978506Line47 The activated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> causes phosphorylation of STATs , which then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus , where they regulate gene transcription . <br>
PMID21605981Line74 Several non - finger domains of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> have been described : two transactivation domains ( TAD ) , located in the N - and C - terminal regions ; a nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) ; a negative regulatory domain ( NRD ) ; and regions that appear to be important for its degradation . <br>
PMID22323480Line114 We included the information as to <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutation status of 39 cases reported in our previous study . <br>
PMID24986690Line141 On the contrary , despite the fact that <font color="blue">calreticulin</font> mutations involve high platelet counts also in PMF , the risk of thrombosis of these patients is relatively low , at least compared with that of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant patients . <br>
PMID22210327Line17 Both <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> genes are located on the X - chromosome and encode for large nuclear proteins that are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues . <br>
PMID22323480Line170 Such an indirect alteration of key proteins known to be involved in malignant transformation could explain the leukemogenic effects of spliceosomal mutations , in particular how spliceosomal mutations may result in a phenocopy of features associated with known <font color="blue">TSG</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line99 The amino terminus of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> contains both PWWP and ADD domains that recognize histone H3 lysine modifications and recruit the protein to specific gene targets ( reviewed in REF . 19 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line245 Moreover , mutations and in - frame translocations of <font color="blue">MLL</font> are now known to result in malignant transformation directly through alterations in post - translational histone modification ( see REF . 91 for an excellent review on <font color="blue">MLL</font> ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line94 <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> and its homologue <font color="blue">DNMT3B</font> are responsible for initiating de novo DNA methylation ; by contrast , <font color="blue">DNMT1</font> maintains methylation through cell division . <br>
PMID25465125Line46 Two large cohort studies have indicated that <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations do not impact overall survival while another study showed that patients with mutant <font color="blue">TET2</font> experienced a superior overall survival when compared with well - matched wild - type controls . <br>
PMID25465125Line126 <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> . <br>
PMID10706759Line74 We also screened for homozygous deletion at <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene by PCR amplification of all exons , but no homozygous deletion was observed in any of the AML cases or 5 cell lines . <br>
PMID22898539Line70 As expected , promoters of genes that are required for specific haematopoietic cell fates are often demethylated as progenitor cells differentiate , whereas genes that are responsible for maintaining a stem or progenitor state such as meis homeobox 1 ( <font color="blue">MEIS1</font> ) and <font color="blue">homeobox A9</font> ( <font color="blue">HOXA9</font> ) become increasingly methylated with differentiation . <br>
PMID21605981Line214 Differentiation of HPCs is highly dependent on the precise timing and levels of expression of GATA factors and combinations of different regulators , such as <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> , EPO , and <font color="blue">ETS1</font> . <br>
PMID21714648Line121 Identical somatic activating mutations of <font color="blue">GNAS</font> have been identified in several types of solid tumors but not in hematologic cancers . <br>
PMID19282830Line119 We also found that missense mutations of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> preferentially ( 89 % ) located in the RHD . <br>
PMID25006131Line77 Somatic mutations in other cohesin genes ( <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">PDS5B</font> , <font color="blue">WAPAL</font> , <font color="blue">MAU2</font> , <font color="blue">REC8</font> , <font color="blue">NIPBL</font> , <font color="blue">SMC5</font> , and <font color="blue">ESCO2</font> ) were present in < . % of our cohort ( Figure 1 and supplemental Tables 2 - 4 ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line67 To date , biological consequences of splicing factor mutations have been tested only for <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutants . <br>
PMID25006131Line81 All cohesin mutations were heterozygous in nature except for mutations in <font color="blue">STAG2</font> and <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , which are located on chromosome X and thus result in the absence of expression of a wild - type ( WT ) allele . <br>
PMID23978506Line69 Rarely , double <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations occurring in cis of exon 10 have been identified . <br>
PMID22878824Line148 Other candidate genes currently being evaluated for prognostic importance include <font color="blue">TET2</font> and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> . <br>
PMID25006131Line183 Figure 6 . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression with annotation by cohesin mutational status and cohesin expression . ( A ) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of TCGA AML patients with annotation of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> low expression and <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation .

Within each group of cohesin low expressors , the entire cohesin family gene complex has similarly decreased expression . <br>
PMID23223431Line156 Initial treatment based on G - <font color="blue">CSF</font> and corticosteroids showed a moderate efficacy on neutropenia . <br>
PMID24986690Line41 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation analysis . <br>
PMID21605981Line120 It has been found that an N - terminally truncated version of <font color="blue">FOG1</font> is produced from an internal ATG , and that this isoform ( designated <font color="blue">FOG1S</font> ) lacks the NuRD - binding domain , altering the complexes with which it interacts . <br>
PMID23531518Line81 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations had no effect on the OS ( P = 0 . 37 ) or leukemia free survival ( 0 . 09 ) ( Table 3 and Figure 1 ) . <br>
PMID21339759Line39 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations were spread over several exons , but predominantly were located in the four conserved regions and , in particular , 6 / 10 mutations were located in the conserved catalytic <font color="blue">SET</font> ( enhancer of zeste and trithorax ) domain ( amino acids 618 - 751 ) , essential for the methyltransferase activity of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line65 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations were initially identified in patients with low - grade glioma and a subpopulation of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , in which a more favorable prognosis may be shown . <br>
PMID21339759Line8 In this study , we aimed to further characterize this defined cohort of CMML patients by studying five additional genes : <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line138 <font color="blue">ETO2</font> , a SCL associated protein with the potential for transcription repression , is also absent from <font color="blue">GATA1</font> - repressed genes but , unlike SCL , fails to accumulate at <font color="blue">GATA1</font> - activated genes . <br>
PMID21605981Line310 Interestingly , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> has been identified as a novel susceptibility gene for coronary artery disease . <br>
PMID23531518Line29 These are broadly categorized into mutations involving epigenetic regulators ( <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ) , spliceosome components ( <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> and <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> ) , DNA - damage response genes ( <font color="blue">TP53</font> ) and transcription regulators and signaling molecules ( <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line128 The <font color="blue">BCL6</font> / <font color="blue">BCOR</font> co - repressor complex plays an important role in early embryonic development . <br>
PMID23619563Line85 Univariate analysis identified <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( HR : 2 . 0 , 95 % CI : 1 . 5 - 2 . 7 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> ( HR : 1 . 6 , 95 % CI : 1 . 1 - 2 . 4 ; P = 0 . 01 ) , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( HR : 1 . 9 , 95 % CI : 1 . 1 - 3 . 4 ; P = 0 . 03 ) and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ( HR : 2 . 5 , 95 % CI : 1 . 1 - 5 . 6 ; P = 0 . 02 ) mutations as being prognostically detrimental for survival . <br>
PMID23054646Line34 Less conspicuously , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were confined to 5 - 7 amino acid positions within the domains corresponding to exons 14 - 15 , of which * 50 % of the mutations were accounted for the K700E . <br>
PMID21605981Line314 Of note , Hoshino et al reported the generation and analysis of <font color="blue">Gata2</font> hypomorphic mutant mice that resembles human congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract . <br>
PMID22878824Line275 In an analysis of patients with <font color="blue">CBF</font> AML treated on CALGB trials ( n = 110 ) , c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations among patients with inv ( 16 ) were associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years ( 56 % vs . 29 % ; P = . 05 ) and decreased 5 - year OS rate ( 48 % vs . 68 % ) compared with wild - type <font color="blue">cKIT</font> ; in multivariate analysis , the presence of c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations remained a significant predictor of decreased OS in the subgroup with inv ( 16 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line241 GATA factors also act sequentially to regulate lineage determination during hematopoiesis by exerting variable repressive effects at the <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> locus . <br>
PMID22323480Line7 Recently , mutations in a gene encoding a spliceosomal protein , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , were discovered in a distinct form of MDS with ring sideroblasts . <br>
PMID25465125Line216 Mutant <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> has been postulated to down - regulate several key gene networks essential in mitochondrial pathways . <br>
PMID24335498Line103 Only 1 patient with favorable cytogenetics had a mutation in a cohesin gene ( <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> ) , whereas the majority of patients with cohesin gene mutations had intermediate risk cytogenetics , most showing a normal karyotype ( supplemental Tables 1 and 2 - 6 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line259 Table 3 . Indications for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> Mutation Testing . <br>
PMID22878824Line100 Among patients with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD and NK - AML , median OS from the time of diagnosis ranged from 6 to 12 months . <br>
PMID23054646Line54 Initial reports indicated a significantly better overall survival for <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutated cases compared to unmutated cases in MDS , while other studies showed no significant impact of the mutations on survival . <br>
PMID24335498Line144 However , further studies are needed to analyze the stability of these markers , as we also found 1 patient in which the <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> mutation from the time of diagnosis was neither present during remission nor at the time of relapse . <br>

PMID21605981Line83 Transgenic reporter mouse analyses have shown that regulatory regions of the IS exon ( 3 . 1 kb ) recapitulate <font color="blue">Gata2</font> gene expression in the para - aortic splanchnopleura region and the yolk sac blood island of mid - gestation mice embryos . <br>
PMID25465125Line52 A recent study of patients with <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations demonstrated that low 5hmC was an unfavorable prognostic marker in <font color="blue">TET2</font> - mutated MDS . <br>
PMID19282830Line139 Other investigators described that trisomy 13 and trisomy 21 were associated with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in AML . <br>
PMID22323480Line176 On the basis of the same phenomenon seen in alternative splicing analysis with the use of mRNAdeep sequencing of <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutants , among the 3 most frequently mutated spliceosomal genes , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations might result in loss of function . <br>
PMID21605981Line160 Hayakawa et al showed that endogenous <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is acetylated in HPCs by p300 , enhancing its DNA - binding activity and transactivating potential . <br>
PMID21714648Line133 These mutations were not strongly associated with clinical features such as cytopenias or blast proportion , findings that are consistent with the observation that <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations occur in diverse myeloid cancers , including myeloproliferative neoplasms , that are not characterized by defects in hematopoietic differentiation . <br>
PMID22898539Line260 A minority of patients present with variant translocations fusing <font color="blue">RARA</font> to other nuclear receptors such as <font color="blue">promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger</font> ( <font color="blue">PLZF</font> ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line124 Besides <font color="blue">FOG1</font> binding , <font color="blue">GATA1</font> recruits CBP / p300 , <font color="blue">MED1</font> , and the chromatin remodeler <font color="blue">BRG1</font> to chromatin sites in a context - dependent manner . <br>
PMID21605981Line300 Survival analysis of 112 patients treated according to a uniform chemotherapy protocol showed that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression correlated with poor prognosis , resulting in shorter overall and event - free survival . <br>
PMID22898539Line299 Only studies in which both <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> were sequenced are included . Mutational frequencies of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> are listed as reported in the original referenced manuscripts ( this may include the controversial <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> pGly646fsX12 variant ( REF . 83 ) ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line129 <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> , also located on chromosome X , shares the similar functional activity . <br>
PMID22878824Line39 Importantly , clinical outcomes in patients with therapy - related AML have been shown to be significantly inferior ( both in terms of relapse - free and overall survivals ) compared with patients with de novo cases , except those with the therapy - related acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) subtype or the favorable - risk core binding factor ( <font color="blue">CBF</font> ) translocations . <br>
PMID25006131Line154 Treatment with the <font color="blue">BRD4</font> inhibitor JQ . 1 leads to a 2 - fold decrease in cohesin occupancy at superenhancer sites and normalization of the expression of oncogenic drivers . <br>
PMID23896413Line67 To avoid infections associated with neutropenia , a large percentage of these patients are treated chronically with G - <font color="blue">CSF</font> to improve neutrophil production . <br>
PMID22878824Line118 Findings from published reports on the prognostic effects of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations have been inconsistent . <br>
PMID25465125Line22 Although over 60 genes have been recently identified , there are 6 genes ( <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ) that are consistently mutated in 10 % or more of MDS patients . <br>
PMID21714648Line72 These studies thus confirmed somatic mutations in five genes ( <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> , <font color="blue">BRAF</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , and <font color="blue">PTPN11</font> ) known to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and identified recurrent mutations in <font color="blue">GNAS</font> that have not been previously reported in hematologic cancers . <br>
PMID20601954Line52 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> encodes the histone methyltransferase that constitutes the catalytic unit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line71 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 mutational frequencies were similar in patients with normal versus abnormal karyotype . <br>
PMID21605981Line231 Altogether , these findings reveal that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is a critical transcription factor that coordinates cellular proliferation and maintains megakaryocyte identity in <font color="blue">GATA1</font> deficient or mutant cells . <br>
PMID24986690Line128 It should be noted , however , that there are major differences in median OS between the same genotypic entities as estimated in the Mayo Clinic vs the present study : 2 . 5 vs 3 . 2 years in triple - negative , 4 . 1 vs 9 . 1 years in <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant , 4 . 3 vs 9 . 2 years in <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant , and 8 . 2 vs 17 . 7 years in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients . <br>
PMID21605981Line199 Another target of this circuit is <font color="blue">EKLF</font> , whose expression at the progenitor stage is dependent on <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and <font color="blue">SMAD5</font> ; in contrast , the maintenance of <font color="blue">EKLF</font> expression in committed erythroid cells is regulated by <font color="blue">GATA1</font> ( Fig . 3 ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line140 In our studies in myeloid malignancies , the most commonly affected spliceosomal genes included <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> , and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line70 As indicated above , the two <font color="blue">GATA2</font> proteins described differ in exon 5 . <br>
PMID22898539Line76 Ley and colleagues first identified somatic mutation of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> in adults with AML after whole - genome sequencing of a human sample of AML with normal cytogenetics . <br>
PMID23619563Line90 Both univariate ( P = 0 . 0004 and P = 0 . 0001 , respectively ) and multivariable ( including karyotype and thrombocytopenia as covariates ; P = 0 . 0002 and P = 0 . 02 , respectively ) analysis for leukemia - free survival identified <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations as being significant . <br>
PMID21605981Line141 Tandem GATA - E - box elements are found at the promoters of several erythroid expressed genes , including the <font color="blue">KLF1</font> , <font color="blue">GATA1</font> , EPB , and <font color="blue">GYPA</font> genes , and in the <font color="blue">HS2</font> beta - globin locus control region . <br>
PMID19282830Line157 Figure 2 . Kaplan - Meier estimates of ( a ) overall survival for CMML patients with and without <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations ( P = 0 . 928 ) , and ( b ) acute myeloid leukemia transformation for CMML patients with and without <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations ( P = 0 . 175 ) , C - terminal mutations vs those without mutation ( P = 0 . 022 ) . CMML , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . <br>
PMID21605981Line315 Interestingly , they found that <font color="blue">Bmp4</font> mRNA was reduced approximately 2 - fold in these <font color="blue">Gata2</font> mutant mice , and showed that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is a direct regulator of <font color="blue">Bmp4</font> transcription . <br>
PMID22210327Line30 Finally , <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mutations in AML were often associated with a decrease in <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mRNA levels , absence of full - length <font color="blue">BCOR</font> protein , and lack or low expression of a truncated <font color="blue">BCOR</font> protein . <br>
PMID22898539Line156 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations have now also been identified in chondrosarcomas , cholangiocarcinomas , colorectal cancer and thyroid cancer , and Mardis et al identified recurrent <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations in AML . <br>
PMID22878824Line322 In a recent report that evaluated the ELN risk classification in a large cohort of patients , those in the " Intermediate I " risk group ( which includes all patients with NK - AML with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> abnormalities and those lacking both <font color="blue">FLT3</font> and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations ) , relapse - free survival was more favorable with allogeneic HSCT ( 94 vs . 7 . 9 months without allogeneic HSCT ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line46 Finally , disruption of the <font color="blue">Gata4</font> and <font color="blue">Gata6</font> genes results in early embryo lethality due to defects in heart tube formation and extraembryonic endoderm development , respectively . <br>
PMID21605981Line225 In contrast , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is expressed at high levels during megakaryocyte differentiation [ 145 ] , also suggesting a relevant role for <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in terminal thrombopoiesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line244 In the absence of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> binding is associated with an undifferentiated state , an intermediate level of <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> expression , and a low - level expression of its downstream myeloid target genes . <br>
PMID19282830Line130 Patient no . 8 had Pro398Leu , which is within the inhibitory domain ( aa372 - 411 ) found to keep the full transactivating potential of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> . <br>
PMID25465125Line47 Regarding treatment , <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations appear to be a genetic predictor of response to azanucleosides [ ( 5 - azacitidine ( AZA ) and decitabine ( DAC ) ) ] , primarily in higher - risk MDS , although these observations require prospective validation . <br>
PMID21339759Line28 After excluding 7 polymorphisms and 9 silent mutations , 13 different aberrations ( Supplementary Table 4 ) were detected in <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ( 1 / 81 ; 1 . 2 % ) , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ( 3 / 81 ; 3 . 7 % ) , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> ( 1 / 81 ; 1 . 2 % ) and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( 9 / 81 ; 11 . 1 % ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line88 Similarly , heterozygous , somatic <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations ( E622D ) were detected in a patient with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts ( RARS ) associated with marked thrombocytosis ( RARS - T ; Figure 1B ) . <br>
PMID22210327Line13 We identified mutated <font color="blue">BCOR</font> through whole - exome sequencing of a CN - AML patient who was selected for analysis because of lack of any known mutations . <br>
PMID23619563Line112 The detrimental effect of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations has also been shown in MDS , AML and CMML . <br>
PMID23531518Line119 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations are common in myeloid malignancies , including MDS , AML , myeloproliferative neoplasm and CMML . <br>
PMID20601954Line44 Collectively , deletions and point mutations of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> were present in 23 % of the affected subjects . <br>
PMID21605981Line164 Chun et al showed that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is a target for SUMO modification and that <font color="blue">PIASy</font> enhances the SUMO conjugation of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , especially by <font color="blue">SUMO2</font> . <br>
PMID25465125Line246 When compared with other RNA splicing gene mutations that occur in MDS , the incidence of <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> mutation is much less , occurring in only about 3 % of patients , precluding a formal ability to ascertain its prognostic significance . <br>
PMID25465125Line112 <font color="blue">UTX</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line230 Furthermore , using a mouse model of human <font color="blue">GATA1</font> mutations present in acute megakaryocytic leukemia with Down syndrome , they demonstrated that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression contributes to aberrant megakaryocyte proliferation in the absence of full - length <font color="blue">GATA1</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line198 Nottingham et al reported that the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , <font color="blue">FLI1</font> , and SCL complex are recruited to the mouse <font color="blue">Runx1</font> enhancer , placing <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> directly downstream of these factors in the transcriptional network that governs HSC emergence . <br>
PMID21605981Line132 Recently , Tripic et al investigated which proteins from among those known to be associated with <font color="blue">GATA1</font> , might consistently distinguish active from repressive <font color="blue">GATA1</font> complexes . <br>
PMID23896413Line109 Figure 2 . Provisional diagnostic algorithm for neutrophilia and genetically informed treatment options . FISH probes for myeloid - associated cytogenetic abnormalities can be used to complement standard karyotype analysis to establish the presence of a clonal myeloid disorder . Cytogenetic / FISH or molecular evaluation of rearranged <font color="blue">PDGFRA</font> / B , and <font color="blue">FGFR1</font> should also be considered if eosinophilia is present . Testing for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F , infrequently identified in CNL or atypical CML , should also be considered . The list of relevant mutations , including molecular abnormalities in complementary signaling pathways to <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> and <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> , may expand over time . For patients who are <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> - mutation negative , use of a JAK inhibitor ( particularly if <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F positive ) or <font color="blue">SRC</font> kinase inhibitor could be considered since mutations in the same or related signaling pathways may be present . <br>
PMID22210327Line49 In conclusion , <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> add to the growing list of genes recurrently mutated in AML . <br>
PMID21605981Line76 The negative regulatory domain , which extends the amino acid residues 74 - 235 , has no apparent homology to <font color="blue">GATA1</font> , <font color="blue">GATA4</font> , <font color="blue">GATA5</font> or <font color="blue">GATA6</font> , but has 46 % homology to the corresponding region of <font color="blue">GATA3</font> , which has been reported as a transcription activation domain . <br>
PMID21605981Line49 In fact , it has been found that <font color="blue">GATA1</font> defects give rise to pleiotropic hematopoietic disorders depending on which particular function is impaired . <br>
PMID21605981Line147 Given that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> also has an essential role in mast cell development , and the fact that <font color="blue">FOG1</font> represses <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression , it is possible that a cross - antagonistic regulatory loop may exist between <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and <font color="blue">FOG1</font> . <br>
PMID10706759Line90 This result is consistent with Gayther ' s study , Chang ' s study , and our previous study of <font color="blue">TSG101</font> and <font color="blue">FHIT</font> , in which aberrant transcriptions with different deletions were frequently identified . However , PCR amplification of aberrant transcripts caused by pre - mRNA splicing that was less stringent in cancer cells than in normal tissues should be considered . <br>
PMID23223431Line25 Recently , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> has been identified as a new predisposing gene for familial AML / MDS . <br>
PMID23978506Line177 As of writing , there were no kits cleared by the FDA for clinical use in testing for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> or <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations ; however , it is possible that a companion diagnostic for the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation will be developed to detect the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation and to quantify the response to targeted therapies . <br>
PMID22878824Line130 In one study , an association was found between <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations and poorer prognosis in the subgroup of patients with NK - AML with otherwise favorable risk ( <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line272 Although the initial report did not break down remission duration by cytogenetic groups , subsequent analysis showed a 5 - year relapse - free survival ( continuous CR measured from time of randomization ) rate of 50 % for <font color="blue">CBF</font> AML , 32 % for patients with normal karyotype , and 15 % for patients in other cytogenetic categories , overall ( P < . 001 ) . <br>
PMID23223431Line183 The risk of malignant transformation was extremely high , because 6 of 14 patients with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations developed a refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and 4 patients developed AML ( Figure 2B ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line14 Mutations in genes of the cohesin complex are recurrent mutations in AML with a strong association with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID23619563Line126 Figure 2 . Kaplan - Meier estimates of overall survival in patients of the European series depending on the mutational status ( wild - type or mutated ) of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutation is presented in ( a ) . The impact of mutations in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> on the cumulative risk of transformation to acute leukemia using a competitive risk analysis is shown in ( b ) . The P - values reported in each panel refer to the comparison of mutated and wild - type subjects . A comparison of overall survival by Kaplan - Meier estimates ( c ) and the cumulative risk of transformation to acute leukemia ( d ) in patients considered at ' mutationally high - risk ' ( that is , those mutated at least in one of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ) versus ' mutationally low - risk ' ( that is , no mutation ) is presented . <br>
PMID24986690Line165 Figure 3 . Cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation in PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation . Vertical tick marks indicate right - censored patients . Triple - negative patients had higher incidence of leukemic transformation compared with both <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant patients ( maximum P value equal to . 043 ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line45 All amplicons from 1 patient were pooled and randomly ligated ( Quick Ligation <font color="blue">Kit</font> , New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line95 Although <font color="blue">DNMT1</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3B</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3L</font> have all been reported to be affected by rare somatic mutations in human malignancies , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> is the only DNMT family member that is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID23896413Line7 Inhibition of <font color="blue">Janus kinase 2</font> or <font color="blue">SRC</font> kinase signaling downstream of mutated <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> is feasible and should be explored therapeutically . <br>
PMID22898539Line236 <font color="blue">Asxl1</font> attenuation resulted in significant perinatal lethality , although surviving mice had defects in B - lymphopoiesis and multiple constitutional developmental defects . <br>
PMID25465125Line42 Despite a relatively high frequency of <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations in MDS , its clinical significance and pathogenesis have not been well defined . <br>
PMID19282830Line27 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations have been described in the M0 subtype of AML , radiation - associated and chemotherapy - related MDS or AML , or in patients with de novo high - risk MDS ; however , only a small number of patients with CMML have been examined for <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations , and the frequency and patterns of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in CMML remain to be defined . <br>
PMID24335498Line154 Because of the strong association between <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations and genes in the cohesin complex , we wanted to find out whether the cohesin mutations have an impact in the <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - mutated patient group . <br>
PMID22898539Line106 More recently , Challen et al carried out more extensive analysis in vivo by studying the effect of Haematopoietic - specific conditional <font color="blue">Dnmt3a</font> deletion on self - renewal in serial transplantation assays . <br>
PMID22878824Line117 This mutation has also been found to be associated with wild - type <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> and the absence of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> abnormalities ( eg , <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD or <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line159 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation . <br>
PMID22878824Line107 The discrepant findings from these studies may be a result of important differences between the studies in factors such as patient baseline characteristics , presence of concurrent genetic lesions ( eg , <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> mutations ) , or inclusion of the APL subtypes . <br>
PMID21605981Line93 Upon induction of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> expression , <font color="blue">GATA1</font> supplants these sites . <br>
PMID25465125Line106 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations have also been reported in MDS / MPN and primary myelofibrosis , but are less frequent in AML ( 1 . 8 % ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line134 Moreover , alternative splicing analysis showed that exon 9 of <font color="blue">FECH</font> was skipped in <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutant cases but not in <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> WT cases , including those with <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations ( supplemental Figure 8 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line228 Recently , Huang et al have dissected the function of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in normal and aberrant megakaryopoiesis . <br>
PMID22210327Line40 However , the way in which <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> mutations contribute to AML development is still not clear . <br>
PMID23223431Line2 High frequency of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in patients with mild chronic neutropenia evolving to MonoMac syndrome , myelodysplasia , and acute myeloid leukemia . <br>
PMID23054646Line46 Interestingly , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations , but not other splicing factor mutations , have also been reported in 5 - 15 % of chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) , especially in high - risk cases . <br>
PMID22878824Line60 In addition , AML with molecular lesions such as mutated <font color="blue">NPM1</font> or <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> genes are considered provisional entities ( further information on these genetic lesions is provided later ) . <br>

No correlation was found with any structural motif , and no mutational hotspots were identified . ( C ) Frequency of cohesin family gene mutations in each myeloid malignancy . ( D ) Distribution of cohesin family gene mutations identified across the patient cohort . <br>
PMID21714648Line115 In a multivariable analysis that included clinical features and other mutations , mutations in five genes - <font color="blue">TP53</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> - were independently associated with decreased overall survival . <br>
PMID25465125Line148 The <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> gene encodes a 170 - kDa nuclear protein that binds SET and interacts with a tumor suppressor gene ( <font color="blue">PP2A</font> ) , playing a critical role in cell proliferation . <br>
PMID21714648Line120 We also identified three samples with activating mutations of amino acid R201 in <font color="blue">GNAS</font> , the gene encoding the Gsalpha subunit of the heterotrimeric Gs - protein complex . <br>
PMID21714648Line93 The mutated genes most strongly associated with a specific karyotype group were <font color="blue">TET2</font> and <font color="blue">TP53</font> . <br>
PMID22898539Line86 The analysis of global methylation levels by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ( LC - MS ) in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - mutant AMLs did not reveal a difference in 5 - methylcytosine ( 5 - mC ) levels . <br>
PMID19282830Line145 We failed to find a survival difference between CMML patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations and those without <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25465125Line66 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations have also been reported in several hematopoietic malignancies such as MDS , myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) , AML ( de novo or secondary to MDS or MPN ) , and CML in blast phase . <br>
PMID22898539Line225 Loss - of - function mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> have been identified in a range of myeloid malignancies , most commonly in patients with MDS , PMF or MDS / MPN overlap disorders . <br>
PMID22898539Line57 These findings strengthened the importance of deregulated epigenetic modifiers in myeloid malignancy pathogenesis which had already been suggested by the finding of recurrent translocations involving histone lysine acetyltransferases ( for example , lysine acetyltransferase 6A ( <font color="blue">KAT6A</font> ; also known as <font color="blue">MOZ</font> ) - nuclear receptor co - activator 2 ( <font color="blue">NCOA2</font> ; also known as <font color="blue">TIF2</font> ) fusion ) and methyltransferases ( for example , <font color="blue">nucleoporin 98</font> ( <font color="blue">NUP98</font> ) - nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 ( <font color="blue">NSD1</font> ) fusion and <font color="blue">mixed - lineage leukaemia</font> ( <font color="blue">MLL</font> ) translocations ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line292 Furthermore , high <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression has been associated with myeloid neoplasias having 3q rearrangements . <br>
PMID25465125Line253 Cohesin complex mutation , mainly in <font color="blue">STAG1</font> ( 1 . 8 % ) , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> ( 1 . 3 % ) , and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> ( 1 . 3 % ) , were detected in a total of 5 . 9 % of AML patients and associated with a low level expression of <font color="blue">BAALC</font> . <br>
PMID22323480Line84 A heterozygous missense mutation in <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> ( Q157R ) was found in a patient with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia ( RCUD ) and uniparental disomy of 2q ( UPD2q ; Figure 1A ) . <br>
PMID20601954Line51 We show here that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> point mutations result in a similar adverse tendency in overall survival ( P = 0 . 076 when measured from the date of diagnosis and P = 0 . 026 when measured from the time of bone marrow sampling ) , but a larger cohort from a prospective clinical trial should be analyzed to assess this properly . <br>
PMID24335498Line125 In the group of <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - mutated AML patients ( n = 137 ) , OS and RFS were not influenced by the presence of mutations in the cohesin complex ( OS : HR 1 . 17 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 53 - 2 . 55 ; P = . 7 ; supplemental Figure 3C ) and ( RFS : HR 0 . 85 ; 95 % CI , 0 . 34 - 2 . 12 ; P = . 72 ; supplemental Figure 3D ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line57 A CNL patient with the <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> T618I membrane proximal mutation was treated with ruxolitinib and exhibited a marked , durable decrease in white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts and resolution of thrombocytopenia ( initially reported as a 5 - month response , now still responding after 11 months ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line242 The presence of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutation appeared to be associated with adverse clinical outcome and an increase in bone marrow blasts . <br>
PMID25006131Line133 Previous work in a zebrafish model identified runx dependence on rad21 expression , and given the high association of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in cohesin mutant myeloid disease , we queried if this relationship would be evident in our patient cohort . <br>
PMID23978506Line21 Clinically , patients with exon 12 mutations typically present with isolated erythrocytosis and suppressed <font color="blue">erythropoietin</font> , in contrast to the trilineage hyperplasia characteristic of patients with V617F mutation . <br>
PMID24986690Line24 The 2008 World Health Organization ( WHO ) definition of PMF includes <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) or <font color="blue">MPL</font> ( W515 ) mutations as a major diagnostic criterion that unequivocally proves the clonal nature of the disease . <br>
PMID23978506Line65 The Y252H mutation , which is located in the extracellular domain of <font color="blue">MPL</font> , confers hypersensitivity to thrombopoietin and increases the generation of megakaryocyte colonies in vitro and leads to increased thrombopoietin signaling and cell growth and survival . <br>
PMID25465125Line83 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , and <font color="blue">UTX</font> are members of pathways that control histone post - translational modifications . <br>
PMID19282830Line117 Harada et al . observed that N - terminal mutations were highly associated with therapy - related MDS , whereas C - terminal mutations of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> preferentially occurred in de novo high - risk MDS or AML after antecedent de novo MDS . <br>
PMID19282830Line128 The remainder are six novel missense mutants at RHD ( nos . 1 - 6 ) and one nonsense mutant , Arg293X , in three patients ( nos . 14 - 16 ) ; whether these mutants can induce <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> functional changes needs further investigation . <br>
PMID20601954Line17 Using DNA sequencing , we and others identified perturbation of <font color="blue">TET2</font> , located at chromosome 4q24 , in 26 % of the individuals with MDS . <br>
PMID22210327Line19 <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> is also a transcriptional corepressor and functional studies have shown that it can bind to class II histone deacetylases ( <font color="blue">HDAC4</font> , <font color="blue">HDAC5</font> , <font color="blue">HDAC7</font> ) , to interact with the <font color="blue">CTBP1</font> corepressor , and to affect the repression of E - cadherin . <br>
PMID21605981Line204 Notably , the expression rate of <font color="blue">Gata2</font> was profoundly reduced in HSCs derived from <font color="blue">Evi1</font> - / - embryos . <br>
PMID22323480Line149 The " protective effect " of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutation on OS was lost in multivariate analysis , including clinical variables such as International Prognostic Scoring System score . <br>
PMID21605981Line193 Besides , <font color="blue">Bmp4</font> transcripts are also concentrated along the ventral aspect of the dorsal aorta in E11 . 5 mouse embryos . <br>
PMID22035746Line158 INCB018424 is a <font color="blue">JAK1</font> / <font color="blue">JAK2</font> inhibitor , and phase I / II studies involved 153 patients with PMF or post - PV / ET MF , 34 patients with PV , and 39 with ET . <br>
PMID22210327Line42 Indeed , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> encodes a methyltransferase enzyme catalyzing the addition of methyl groups to CpG dinucleotides . <br>
PMID21605981Line39 <font color="blue">Gata2</font> expression also rescued the embryonic lethal phenotype of the <font color="blue">Gata1</font> mutation . <br>
PMID24335498Line110 There was no significant difference between patients with or without a mutation in the cohesin complex with regard to gene expression of <font color="blue">MN1</font> , <font color="blue">ERG</font> , <font color="blue">EVI1</font> , <font color="blue">MLL5</font> , and <font color="blue">WT1</font> . <br>
PMID23978506Line172 Results of <font color="blue">MPL</font> assays should be reported in a similar fashion as those described above for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> . <br>
PMID23978506Line39 What Are the Currently Known <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> Mutations ? <br>
PMID21605981Line321 In conclusion , even though plentiful interesting data about <font color="blue">GATA2</font> have already been collected , many questions remain that might stimulate future research . <br>
PMID23978506Line193 A proficiency test for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F is available from the College of American Pathologists ( 2013 Surveys and Anatomic Pathology Education Programs , http : / / www . cap . org / apps / docs / proficiency _ testing / 2013 _ surveys _ catalog . pdf , last accessed November 28 , 2012 ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line12 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations were independently associated with poor survival , but only <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations held their prognostic relevance ( HR : 1 . 4 ; P = 0 . 04 ) independent of the Dynamic IPSS ( DIPSS ) - plus model , which incorporates cytogenetic risk . <br>
PMID22323480Line95 Although we identified 2 mutant copies of <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> ( 21q22 . 3 ) in a sAML case with trisomy 21 ( supplemental Figure 2 ) , all other 19 cases of trisomy 21 screened for this mutation were negative . <br>
PMID22898539Line91 Likewise , little is known about the timing of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations during disease evolution . <br>
PMID22035746Line61 <font color="blue">TET2</font> is a putative tumor suppressor gene and mutational frequency is estimated at 16 % for PV , 5 % for ET , and 17 % for PMF . <br>
PMID23531518Line74 Table 2 describes the <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutational prevalence in 179 patients with CMML . <br>
PMID23896413Line103 Given the poor prognosis of these disorders , the potential applicability of JAK or <font color="blue">SRC</font> kinase inhibitors is an important bench - tobedside implication of the discovery of activating <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations . <br>
PMID21605981Line59 A new <font color="blue">GATA2</font> transcript variant with an additional exon has been included recently in the NCBI database ; however , no further information on this transcript has been reported . <br>
PMID24335498Line159 We found a strong association between these mutations and mutations in <font color="blue">NPM1</font> . <br>
PMID23896413Line75 In contrast , the membrane proximal mutations exhibit receptor activation in the complete absence of ligand , suggesting distinct mechanisms of activation of these classes of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25465125Line230 Sequencing analyses have demonstrated that the <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutation appears to be an early event in the development of MDS , perhaps making it a relevant therapeutic target . <br>
PMID22898539Line148 In a more recent report , <font color="blue">Tet2</font> - knockout mice developed a disease with MDS - like features including erythroid progenitor expansion . <br>
PMID22323480Line115 When 310 patients genotyped for these mutations were analyzed , the presence of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations was associated with longer survival and <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutations with shorter survival , whereas <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations had no effect on survival . <br>
PMID21605981Line260 Interestingly , performing genome - wide microarray experiments in G1ME cells , they identified four novel and direct targets of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in megakaryocytes including conserved elements within intron 1 of <font color="blue">Hhex</font> , and <font color="blue">Slamf1</font> , <font color="blue">Sfpi1</font> , and <font color="blue">Lmo2</font> . <br>
PMID24986690Line87 These latter patients showed a higher incidence of leukemic transformation compared with both <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant ( P = . 016 ) and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutated patients ( P = . 043 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line228 Based on studies with D . melanogaster homologues , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> is thought to associate with both repressive PcG and activating Trithorax complexes . <br>
PMID22898539Line184 Mutations in histone - modifying enzymes <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations and genetic loss of PRC2 function in myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID23978506Line6 Detection of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations has been incorporated into routine diagnostic algorithms for these diseases . <br>
PMID21605981Line194 The <font color="blue">Gata2</font> promoter responds to <font color="blue">BMP4</font> signaling , which also initiates <font color="blue">Fli1</font> expression in Xenopus , and as such <font color="blue">BMP4</font> - singnaling is another candidate initiator of the circuit . <br>
PMID21714648Line74 In addition to the known cytogenetic abnormalities , we identified a single case with a focal deletion encompassing <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , a gene that is recurrently involved in translocations in acute leukemia but is not known to be mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes ( Fig . 3 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line210 Western blot analysis demonstrated that protein levels of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> are lower in patients with aplastic anemia than those in normal subjects . <br>
PMID22375971Line33 Patients were eligible for the study if they were 18 years of age or older and had primary myelofibrosis , post - polycythemia vera myelofibrosis , or post - essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis according to 2008 World Health Organization criteria , with a life expectancy of 6 months or longer , an International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) score ( see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM . org ) of 2 ( intermediate - 2 risk ) or 3 or more ( high risk ) , an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 or less ( on a scale from 0 to 5 , with higher scores indicating greater disability ; see the Supplementary Appendix for further details ) , less than 10 % peripheral - blood blasts , an absolute peripheral - blood <font color="blue">CD34</font> + cell count of more than 20x106 per liter , a platelet count of 100x109 per liter or more , and palpable splenomegaly ( > = 5 cm below the left costal margin ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line78 Finally , the question of whether the recently characterized small molecular inhibitor of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> might have a therapeutic role in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms with splicing factor mutations remains to be addressed . <br>
PMID23896413Line6 Recently , we identified high - frequency oncogenic mutations in the granulocyte - colony stimulating factor receptor ( <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ) in CNL and in some patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia . <br>
PMID22898539Line158 Cancer - associated mutations of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> are heterozygous and occur at one of three highly conserved arginine residues : <font color="blue">IDH1</font> - R132 , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R172 and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R140 . <br>
PMID23223431Line10 The subsequent analysis of the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry allowed the identification of 6 additional pedigrees and 10 patients with 6 different and not previously reported <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations ( R204X , E224X , R330X , A372T , M388V , and a complete deletion of the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line94 To explore whether these specific molecular assets associated with unique gene expression profiles , we compared <font color="blue">CD34</font> + cells from 9 mutationally high and 11 mutationally low - risk patients , randomly selected in the European cohort . <br>
PMID21605981Line172 Using a microarray screening approach , miR - 144 and miR - 451 were identified as <font color="blue">GATA1</font> - regulated miRNAs . <br>
PMID24986690Line167 Figure 5 . Kaplan - Meier analysis of survival of PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation and subdivided according to their IPSS risk . Vertical tick marks indicate right - censored patients . ( A ) " Lower " IPSS risk subgroup , including patients with low or intermediate - 1 IPSS risk : <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had longer survival compared with either <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) - mutant ( P = . 011 ) or triple - negative patients ( P = . 001 ) . ( B ) " Higher risk " subgroup , including patients with intermediate - 2 or high IPSS risk : <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had longer survival compared with the remaining genetic subgroups ( maximum P value equal to . 023 ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line135 <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , Ets variant 6 , is an ETS transcriptional repressor ( locus of 12p13 ) and plays a critical role in embryogenesis and hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID22898539Line96 This probably relates to the partially non - overlapping roles of <font color="blue">DNMT1</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3B</font> , and suggests a possible unique role for <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> in haematopoiesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line118 Furthermore , gene expression analysis of mutant megakaryocytes and erythroid progenitors showed significantly increased levels of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , indicating that <font color="blue">FOG1</font> / NuRD interaction is required for the earlier described ' GATA switch ' . <br>
PMID21605981Line212 Furthermore , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> suppresses adipocyte differentiation through direct inhibition of adipogenic factors , including peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - gamma ( <font color="blue">PPARy</font> ) , indicating that fatty marrow replacement in patients with aplastic anemia can be explained by downregulation of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and overexpression of <font color="blue">PPARy</font> . <br>
PMID23978506Line67 Overall , <font color="blue">MPL</font> W515L or W515K mutations are present in patients with PMF and ET at a frequency of approximately 5 % and 3 % , respectively . <br>
PMID22878824Line98 <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD occurs in approximately 30 % of cases and is more common than <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations , which occur in approximately 10 % of patients . <br>
PMID23054646Line47 In addition , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> are mutated in several solid cancers , including breast , bladder , endometrial and other cancers , although the mutation frequencies were low . <br>
PMID23978506Line79 Similarly , nearly one third of patients with <font color="blue">RARS</font> - T were found to have a <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation . <br>
PMID23223431Line15 Mutations have been described previously in congenital neutropenia that is isolated ( eg , mutations of <font color="blue">ELANE</font> ) , associated with immunologic defects ( eg , mutations of <font color="blue">CXCR4</font> or WAS genes ) , or involves extra - hematopoietic manifestations , the most frequent being <font color="blue">HAX1</font> ( Kostmann disease ) , SDBS ( Shwachman - Bodian - Diamond Syndrome ) , or <font color="blue">G6PC3</font> . <br>
PMID23223431Line119 Overall , we detected a <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation in 14 white patients . <br>
PMID22898539Line303 Figure 3 . Janus kinase signalling affects the epigenome through direct and indirect activities . <font color="blue">Janus kinase 1</font> ( <font color="blue">JAK1</font> ) and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> have recently been shown to be able to enter the nucleus and to directly phosphorylate ( P ) tyrosine 41 of histone H3 ( H3Y41 ) . At least one consequence of H3Y41 phosphorylation is displaced binding of the repressive protein heterochromatin protein 1alpha ( HP1alpha ) from chromatin . The genome - wide effects of H3Y41 phosphorylation and HP1alpha localization in contexts with and without JAK overactivity have yet to be published . Nor is it clear exactly how <font color="blue">JAK1</font> and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> enter the nucleus . In addition to phosphorylating H3Y41 , nuclear <font color="blue">JAK2</font> has been shown to phosphorylate <font color="blue">protein arginine methyltransferase 5</font> ( <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> ) . This thereby inhibits <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> activity and results in reduced histone H2A and H4 arginine methyltransferase activity . Mutated forms of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , as seen most prominently in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms , result in increased kinase activity on the substrate <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> . H4R3me2 , histone H4 dimethylated on arginine 3 . <br>
PMID23978506Line212 The 16 specimens having a high rate of false - negative results tended to have lower <font color="blue">JAK2</font> allele burden in those laboratories doing quantitative assays , suggesting that the false - negative results were mostly due to assays with lower analytical sensitivity . <br>
PMID21714648Line29 Only mutations in the <font color="blue">TP53</font> gene have been clearly associated with poor prognostic markers , such as a complex karyotype ( having three or more chromosomal abnormalities ) , and have been reported to independently predict survival among patients at intermediate risk , as ascertained with the use of the International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line51 Genetic and functional studies have suggested that there are at least two classes of myeloid leukaemia disease alleles that contribute to haematopoietic transformation : class I alleles , which confer a growth advantage by activating downstream effectors of various signalling pathways including members of the <font color="blue">signal transducer and activator of transcription</font> ( <font color="blue">STAT</font> ) , PI3K and RAS - MAPK pathways ; and class II alleles , which alter the expression of key transcriptional targets in myelopoiesis . <br>
PMID10706759Line7 Mutations in <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> are most frequently found in advanced cancers . <br>
PMID25465125Line76 IDH mutations commonly involve exon 4 and affect three specific arginine residues : Arg132 ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ) , Arg172 ( <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ) , and Arg140 ( <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line76 <font color="blue">JAK2</font> exon - 12 mutations are present in the majority of patients who were <font color="blue">JAK2V617</font> negative and 3 % of patients with PV overall . <br>
PMID22898539Line152 <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> : metabolic inputs . <br>
PMID24335498Line134 In the recent report of the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network , no mutations in <font color="blue">STAG1</font> were detected , whereas the mutation frequency in <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> was slightly higher ( 2 . 5 % - 3 . 5 % ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line82 Patients with <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations present with higher peripheral white blood cell counts and frequently also harbour nucleophosmin ( <font color="blue">NPM1</font> ) , <font color="blue">FMS - related tyrosine kinase 3</font> ( <font color="blue">FLT3</font> ) and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations . <br>

Afterwards , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , <font color="blue">FLI1</font> , and the SCL complex are recruited to the <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> enhancer , activating its transcription . <font color="blue">BMP4</font> transcription is dependent on <font color="blue">GATA2</font> .

PMID22035746Line12 Despite the optimism , it is increasingly apparent that pathogenicity in <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPN is more complex than for chronic myeloid leukemia , and a pathognomonic mutation may not be forthcoming . <br>
PMID21605981Line295 To further clarify the significance of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression in AML , our group has investigated for the first time the prevalence of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> overexpression by real - time RT - PCR in a large series of AML patients , correlated the results to cytogenetics and other molecular markers , and studied its prognostic relevance . <br>

PMID25465125Line50 One recent study showed that coincidence of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations occurred in 35 % of patients with MDS / AML and also demonstrated that an <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutation augments the repopulating capacity of hematopoietic stem cells and causes myeloid proliferation . <br>
PMID25465125Line268 Fig . 2 . Schematic RNA Splicing . Adopted and modified according to Cazzola M et al . Blood 2013 ; 121 : 260 - 269 and Yoshida K et al . Nature , 2011 , 478 : 64 - 69 . ( A ) Human pre - mRNA consists of exon and intron sequences . During RNA splicing process , introns are removed and exons are retained and formed mature mRNA with normal sequences . The RNA splicing is performed in spliceosome where resides a macromolecular structure composed of 5 ' - snRNAs associated with proteins to form particles termed <font color="blue">snRNPs</font> . The outcomes of mutation vary according to mutated sites and components , which could lead to retention of intron ( s ) , truncation or missing of exon ( s ) , as well as increased or decreased pre - mRNA level . ( B ) There are 2 classes of introns : the majority is U2 type and the rare is <font color="blue">U12</font> type , which will be catalyzed by 2 different spliceosomes , U2 - <font color="blue">orU12</font> - dependent spliceosomes . The key signal sequences are located the donor site ( DS ) ( arrow points to 5 ' end of the intron ) , the branch site ( BS ) ( arrow points to near the 3 ' end ) , and the splice acceptor site ( AS ) ( arrow points to 3 ' end ) . In the major U2 - dependent spliceosome , the 5 ' donor site is recognized by the U1 <font color="blue">snRNP</font> , whereas the branch site is recognized by the U2 <font color="blue">snRNP</font> . RNA splicing is complicated and requires many components . It begins with the recruitment of U1 <font color="blue">snRNP</font> to the 5 ' SS . Two U2 auxiliary factors are needed to bind different sites . The large one , U2A65 , along with <font color="blue">SF1</font> , binds the branch point sequence ( BPS ) and its downstream polypyrimidine tract while the smaller subunit , <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> , binds to the AG dinucleotide of the 3 ' SS , interacting with both <font color="blue">U2AF65</font> and a SR protein , such as <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> is also required for RNA splicingby interacting with U2AF and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> proteins . After the recognition of the 3 ' SS , U2 <font color="blue">snRNP</font> , together with <font color="blue">SF3A1</font> and <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , is recruited to the 3 ' SS to generate the splicing complex . Mutation of U2AF , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> or ZESR2 involving in RNA splicing results in abnormal mRNA pattern e . g . , intron retention , truncation of exon due to cryptic splice site or missing exon . Pre - mRNA level can be either increased or decreased . Note : I = intron , E ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) = exon 1 , 2 , 3 ; snRNps = small nuclear ribonucleoproteins . <br>
PMID22035746Line62 The role of <font color="blue">TET2</font> in the classification of MPN is limited because <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations have been identified in most other myeloid malignancies . <br>

PMID23896413Line99 In patients for whom the cause of neutrophilia is not easily discernible , the incorporation of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation testing can be a useful point - of - care diagnostic to evaluate for the presence of a clonal myeloid disorder , as well as the potential for genetically informed therapy ( Figure 2 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line149 Thus , high <font color="blue">GATA2</font> levels would silence <font color="blue">FOG1</font> expression in maturing mast cells , leading to enhanced <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression and further <font color="blue">FOG1</font> repression . <br>
PMID23978506Line78 Of patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis , 31 % were found to have associated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutations and often had a latent MPN , with the most common site of thrombosis occurring in the portal venous system . <br>
PMID21605981Line29 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression has a broad distribution among hematopoietic cells , with a particularly prominent expression in early progenitors , as well as in megakaryocytes and in mast cell lineages . <br>
PMID24986690Line127 On the contrary , PMF with nonmutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , or <font color="blue">MPL</font> has a poor prognosis with a particularly high risk of leukemic transformation , as shown by a study of the Mayo Clinic and by the present work . <br>
PMID21605981Line84 Furthermore , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> gene expression is determined by multiple cis - regulatory elements spread over a wide range of the mouse genome . <br>
PMID21605981Line111 Functional analyses demonstrated that this single mutation was sufficient to reduce <font color="blue">FOG1</font> binding to <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and to inhibit the ability of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> to rescue erythroid differentiation in the G1E murine cell line . <br>
PMID23223431Line192 Mutations of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> described previously are highly heterogeneous ( supplemental Table 3 ) , ranging from the creation of a stop codon ( R337X ) , a frameshift mutation scattered over the whole coding frame ( R78 , G81 , L105 , A194 , G200 , D259 , N317 , L332 and A341 ) , deletions ( ranging from large deletions encompassing the whole <font color="blue">GATA2</font> locus to smaller deletions such as codons 1 - 290 , codons 340 - 381 , codons 341 - 346 , and codons 362 - 365 or T355 ) , and point mutations ( located close to the second zinc finger domain with the exception of P254L : P304H , C319SC , T344M , T354M , L359V , R361L , R362Q , N371K , C373R , R396W , R396Q , and R398W ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line92 Highly sensitive qPCR for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F may have value in followup of patients with primary and secondary myelofibrosis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation . <br>
PMID19282830Line31 We also found that C - terminal mutations of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> in CMML predicted an increased risk and shorter time to AML transformation . <br>
PMID21605981Line219 We have already examined the unique switching profile that the expression profile of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> shows during erythroid differentiation ( Fig . 2 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line72 Truncated <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> may lack the di - leucine internalization motif , resulting in an increase in cell surface expression of the receptor . <br>
PMID10706759Line85 The somatic deletions and mutations of <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene were identified in several cancer cell lines and primary cancers including glioma , breast , endometrium , prostate , thyroid , and malignant melanoma . <br>
PMID20601954Line6 We report here that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , located at 7q36 . 1 , is frequently targeted in MDS . Analysis of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> deletions , missense and frameshift mutations strongly suggests that <font color="blue">EZH2</font> is a tumor suppressor . <br>
PMID21339759Line10 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> belongs to the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb gene family and is mutated in 33 % of CMML . <br>
PMID25465125Line140 A recent large - scale study of <font color="blue">ETV6</font> rearrangements in myeloid malignancies identified a low frequency of occurrence ( 0 . 5 % , 51 of 9550 patients ) , comprising 1 . 1 % of AML ( 40 of 3798 ) and 0 . 2 % of MDS ( 6 of 3375 ) patients . <br>
PMID24335498Line149 It has already been suggested that <font color="blue">NPM1</font> is an early event in leukemogenesis . <br>
PMID21605981Line253 Another mechanism of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> action seems to be the activation of SCL after <font color="blue">GATA2</font> binding to its promoter , controlling progenitor cell survival in primitive hematopoiesis . <br>
PMID24335498Line97 From a total of 23 putative mutations in cohesin genes , the somatic status could be confirmed in 16 by analyzing remission samples or T - cells ( CD3 + <font color="blue">CD11b</font> - <font color="blue">CD14</font> - CD3 + ) , which were purified from diagnostic samples by flow cytometry ( supplemental Tables 2 - 6 ) . <br>
PMID21339759Line55 Of note , for the most frequently mutated genes , that is , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , RAS and <font color="blue">CBL</font> various pairwise analyses were performed between wild - type / wild - type , mutated / wild - type , wild - type / mutated and mutated / mutated combinations . <br>

PMID22898539Line215 Notably , mutations in <font color="blue">EZH2</font> were associated with impaired survival in MDS but not with an increased risk of transformation to AML ; these data suggest a differential role for PRC2 function in acute and chronic myeloid malignancies , which is supported by the current absence of reported <font color="blue">EZH2</font> mutations in de novo AML . <br>
PMID22898539Line301 Figure 1 . Leukaemia - associated mutations in the DNA methylation and demethylation pathway . The process of DNA methylation and the enzymes involved are shown . Enzymes known to be affected by somatic mutations in myeloid leukaemia are marked with an asterisk . The catalytic domain of the TET family of methylcytosine dioxygenases is contained within the conserved carboxyl - terminal region . <font color="blue">TET1</font> and <font color="blue">TET3</font> each contain an amino - terminal CxxC zinc - finger domain that is probably responsible for DNA binding ; by contrast , <font color="blue">TET2</font> does not possess a CxxC domain , consistent with a likely requirement for other proteins to direct <font color="blue">TET2</font> localization within the genome . There are splice variants of <font color="blue">TET2</font> that do not contain the carboxyl - terminal catalytic domain ; the function of these variants , which are abundantly expressed in haematopoietic cells , are not yet understood . Although it is not yet clear whether 5 - hydroxymethylcytosine ( 5 - hmC ) is consistently associated with activation and / or repression of transcription , 5 - hmC has been shown to specifically recruit at least one protein - binding complex subunit - the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase ( NURD ) complex member <font color="blue">methyl - CpG binding domain protein 3</font> ( <font color="blue">MBD3</font> ) - to repress the transcription of genes marked by 5 - hmC . Currently 5 - carboxylcytosine , 5 - formylcytosine , and 5 - hydroxymethyluracil are only known to be by - products of 5 - hmC in DNA demethylation , but no specific functions have been described . 2 - HG , 2 - hydroxyglutarate ; alpha - KG , alpha - ketoglutarate ; <font color="blue">AID</font> , <font color="blue">activation - induced cytidine deaminase</font> ; BER , base - excision repair ; <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">DNA methyltransferase 3A</font> ; IDH , isocitrate dehydrogenase ; NADP + , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ; SAH , S - adenosylhomocysteine ; SAM , S - adenosylmethionine ; TDG , <font color="blue">thymine DNA glycosylase</font> . <br>

PMID22898539Line159 Although mutations of R140 in <font color="blue">IDH2</font> exclusively result in the substitution of arginine to glutamine ( <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R140Q ) , mutations affecting <font color="blue">IDH1</font> - R132 or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R172 consist of a broader range of amino - acid substitutions ( IDH1 - R132H , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> - R132C , IDH2 - R172K , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R172M and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R172S ) . <br>
PMID23619563Line97 In this international collaborative project , we studied two independent cohorts of patients with PMF in order to clarify the prognostic relevance of newly described mutations , including <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">CBL</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <br>

PMID20601954Line61 This indicates that deregulation of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> in cancer may not be generalized into one simple mechanism . <br>
PMID22898539Line305 Figure 5 . Proposed updated model of myeloid malignancy pathogenesis based on mutational data from patient samples . The myeloid malignancies have previously been thought to be induced by mutations in genes that normally promote increased growth or enhance survival ( so - called class I genetic alterations ) in concert with co - occurring mutations in genes that are normally involved in haematopoietic differentiation ( so - called class II genetic alterations ) . Mutations in class I genes consist of activating mutations in genes such as <font color="blue">FMS - related tyrosine kinase 3</font> ( <font color="blue">FLT3</font> ) , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> and <font color="blue">KIT</font> . These class I alterations are rarely co - occurring , which is consistent with their overlapping function in myeloid malignancy transformation . This is visually depicted using primary data from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia ( AML ) in the form of a Circos diagram . Recently , a series of mutually exclusive mutations that affect DNA hydroxymethylation have been found in patients with myeloid malignancies ; these include <font color="blue">tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2</font> ( <font color="blue">TET2</font> ) , <font color="blue">isocitrate dehydrogenase 1</font> ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ) or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations , and potentially other heretofore unidentified disease alleles . Class II mutations occur in genes that are involved in regulating the chromatin state ( such as <font color="blue">mixed - lineage leukaemia</font> ( <font color="blue">MLL</font> ) and <font color="blue">additional sex combs - like 1</font> ( <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ) ) or DNA methylation ( such as <font color="blue">DNA methyltransferase 3A</font> ( <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> ) ) ; again , these mutations rarely co - occur , which is consistent with redundant roles in oncogenic transformation . Moreover , functional data of several genes in this new class of epigenetic modifier mutation have been found to affect both cellular proliferation as well as cellular differentiation ( for example , translocations in <font color="blue">MLL</font> as well as loss - of - function mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> ) . On this basis , a revised model of myeloid malignancy pathogenesis is depicted here , in which mutations in class I , class II and in two novel classes of epigenetic modifier genes co - occur to promote myeloid transformation . <font color="blue">CBF</font> , <font color="blue">CCAAT - binding factor</font> ; <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , <font color="blue">CCAAT / enhancer binding protein - alpha</font> ; <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , nucleophosmin ; <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">runt - related transcription factor 1</font> . <br>
PMID23054646Line13 The spectrum of gene mutations in MDS and related myeloid neoplasms includes mutations involving classical signaling molecules , such as <font color="blue">NRAS</font> / <font color="blue">KRAS</font> , PTNP11 , <font color="blue">NF1</font> , <font color="blue">c - CBL</font> , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , and <font color="blue">FLT3</font> , and those involving hematopoietic transcription factors , such as <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , <font color="blue">ETV6</font> , and <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , together with <font color="blue">TP53</font> and other tumor suppressor genes . <br>
PMID23531518Line82 Ninety patients ( 40 % ) had <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations , 13 ( 6 % ) had <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations and 20 ( 9 % ) had <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutations . <br>
PMID10706759Line70 All of these patterns were found in our AML patients . Sequencing of the normal - sized RT - PCR products amplified from the AML specimens , cell lines , and normal controls showed wild - type <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> transcripts except in the U937 line ( 4 - base insertion ) ( data not shown ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line233 Moreover , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> directly interacts with the PRC2 complex in reciprocal co - immunoprecipitation experiments . <br>
PMID23223431Line205 In the present study , we identified <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations as a cause of congenital mild neutropenia associated with a high risk of leukemic transformation . <br>
PMID21605981Line134 In striking contrast , the SCL complex was depleted at sites where <font color="blue">GATA1</font> functions as a repressor . <br>
PMID23054646Line55 <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations were reported to be associated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis , but may not be an independent prognostic predictor . <br>
PMID25465125Line177 Cenersen , an antisense oligonucleotide complementary to <font color="blue">TP53</font> , suppresses mutant p53 expression and restores impaired erythropoiesis in patients with del ( 5q ) MDS . <br>
PMID10706759Line18 Somatic mutations of the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene have been identified in a number of cancer cell lines and primary cancers , and most frequently found in advanced cancers . <br>
PMID23619563Line107 Accordingly , whereas the outcome of patients with IPSS / DIPSS - plus high - risk disease may not be affected by the presence of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations , the apparently lower - risk patients might not fare as well as expected , an observation that might affect therapeutic decisions . <br>
PMID24335498Line146 Interestingly , cohesin genes have been found to bind to CCCTC - binding factor , a sequence - specific transcription factor that is known to interact with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> in addition to regulating tumor suppressor loci . <br>
PMID19282830Line97 The overall survival of patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations did not differ from those without mutations ( median 15 . 7 months vs 12 . 8 months , P = 0 . 928 , Figure 2a ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line79 Recurrent mutations in <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> were recently identified in 25 % of aCML patients . <br>
PMID22898539Line162 2 - HG is present at markedly elevated levels in the serum of patients with AML harbouring <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations , suggesting that 2 - HG could be a biomarker for IDH - mutant AML . <br>
PMID22878824Line119 Although some studies showed no prognostic effect of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations on OS when considering all IDH mutations ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> combined ) or in the overall patient population , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations seemed to be associated with significantly worse outcomes in the subgroup of patients with NK - AML with favorable - or intermediate - risk disease . <br>
PMID25465125Line94 Subsequent analysis has confirmed this finding , showing an overall frequency of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutation ranging from 14 . 4 % to 20 . 7 % of MDS . <br>

PMID25465125Line146 The <font color="blue">ETV6</font> mutation appears also to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with MDS ( hazard ratio = 2 . 04 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 08 - 3 . 86 ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line9 The results showed aberrant <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> transcripts in 15 of the 62 ( 24 % ) AML patients , 4 of the 5 cell lines ( 80 % ) , and 4 of the 30 ( 13 % ) normal controls . <br>
PMID23978506Line217 In a second example , one assay reported a specimen positive for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F that was reported negative in all other laboratories ; however , that specimen was found to have a <font color="blue">JAK2</font> exon 12 mutation , which is mutually exclusive with the V617F mutation . <br>
PMID23223431Line223 Table 1 . Biologic and clinical presentations of patients with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22878824Line131 However , in another recent study , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutation ( restricted to <font color="blue">IDH2</font> - R140 ) was associated with improved survival among the overall study population , and among the subgroup of patients with favorable risk ( intermediate - risk AML with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD ) . <br>
PMID23054646Line45 Less prominently , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations were more frequently found in CMML ( 30 . 7 - 47 % ) than in other subtypes of myeloid neoplasms . <br>

Data are shown for the platelet count ( Panel A ) , percentage of blasts in bone marrow aspirate ( Panel B ) , and hemoglobin level ( Panel C ) at the time of bone marrow sample collection . The numbers in parentheses along the x axis indicate the number of patients with a mutation in the gene ( patients could have > 1 mutated gene ) . Mutations in <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">TP53</font> , and <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> were significantly associated with severe thrombocytopenia ( defined as < 50 , 000 platelets per cubic millimeter ) ( P < 0 . 001 for each comparison ) ( Panel A ) and elevated blast percentage ( defined as > = 5 % ) ( P < 0 . 001 , P = 0 . 005 , and P = 0 . 003 for mutations in the three genes , respectively ) ( Panel B ) . <br>

PMID21605981Line35 With the exception of <font color="blue">GATA5</font> , null mutations for each of the GATA genes results in embryonic lethality in mice , showing they are crucial transcriptional regulators in cell development . <br>
PMID22898539Line270 Regulators of DNA methylation ( such as <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> ) and of histone modifications ( such as <font color="blue">MLL</font> translocations , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ) are targeted by somatic alterations in a significant subset of patients with myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID23896413Line100 The basis for phenotypic differences between <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutation - positive CNL and aCML may relate to multiple factors . <br>
PMID24986690Line43 Patients without <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) were evaluated for <font color="blue">MPL</font> exon 10 mutations using a high - resolution melt assay or Sanger sequencing . <br>
PMID21605981Line146 Interestingly , they also found high <font color="blue">GATA2</font> occupancy and relatively low <font color="blue">GATA1</font> at one of the cis - regulatory elements that controls <font color="blue">FOG1</font> expression , which is normally occupied by <font color="blue">GATA1</font> in erythroid cells . <br>
PMID21605981Line290 It has been reported that ectopic expression of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> promotes erythroblast proliferation while it blocks erythroid terminal differentiation . <br>
PMID23978506Line11 In 2005 , several groups simultaneously described a point mutation in codon 617 of the protein tyrosine kinase gene <font color="blue">Janus kinase 2</font> ( <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ) in <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative myeloproliferative neoplasms ( MPN ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line85 Seventy - four of 617 patients ( 12 % ) progressed to blast phase ( leukemic transformation ) , including 43 of 399 subjects ( 11 % ) with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> mutation , 17 of 140 ( 12 % ) with <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation , 3 of 25 ( 12 % ) with <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation , and 11 of 53 triple - negative subjects ( 21 % ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line108 In fact , <font color="blue">FOG1</font> - deficient mice display erythropoietic defects that largely mimic those found in <font color="blue">Gata1</font> - null mice . <br>
PMID23978506Line173 Given the diversity of known <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations , the precise mutation detected should be reported using HGVS - standard nucleotide and amino acid nomenclature . <br>
PMID24335498Line8 Patients with any cohesin complex mutation had lower <font color="blue">BAALC</font> expression levels . <br>
PMID19282830Line114 However , we had examined a large number of Chinese patients with de novo AML and had found that <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations , except for AML - M0 subtype , were rarely present ( data not shown ) . <br>

PMID24335498Line95 The 2 mutations in <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> were both missense mutations ( Figure 1 and supplemental Table 6 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line248 However , recent studies have demonstrated a novel role for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> in epigenetic regulation . <br>
PMID25465125Line222 <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> . <br>
PMID19282830Line133 Activating mutations of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> and RAS genes are of class I , whereas <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutation is of class II . <br>
PMID24986690Line140 As previously observed in ET , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) appears to be highly thrombophilic also in patients with PMF , indicating that this mutation likely causes thrombosis through multiple mechanisms , including activation of platelets and granulocytes . <br>
PMID25465125Line167 <font color="blue">TP53</font> . <br>
PMID23531518Line80 Sixteen <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations were novel and have not been reported to date ( Table 2 ) . <br>
PMID22210327Line26 Importantly , they occurred at a higher frequency ( about 17 % ; 14 of 82 cases ) in the subset of CN - AML devoid of <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> , <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , and MLLPTD mutations , and mostly also lacking <font color="blue">IDH1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22323480Line155 In sum , most of the available results suggest that <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations convey better survival in the cohort of whole myeloid malignancies , including RARS and RCMD - RS . <br>
PMID21605981Line162 Besides , the human <font color="blue">GATA2</font> protein contains two putative SUMOylation sites : MKME ( amino acids 221 - 224 ) and MKKE ( amino acids 388 - 391 ) . <br>
PMID24335498Line91 Six of 7 mutations in <font color="blue">STAG1</font> were missense mutations , while one patient showed a frameshift mutation ( Figure 1 and supplemental Table 2 ) . <br>
PMID21714648Line127 The presence ( vs . the absence ) of mutations of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> carried a more modest hazard ratio for death ( 1 . 38 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 00 to 1 . 89 ] ) , but <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , as the second most commonly mutated gene identified in this study , contributed additional risk to the greatest number of patients . <br>
PMID23619563Line34 Similar techniques were used for analyzing the Mayo samples for mutations found to be prognostically relevant in the European cohort : <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ( see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table S1 for details ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line116 <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations can be observed as an early , probably disease - initiating event in patients with MPN , and can also be observed as a later disease event in patients with MPN whose disease transforms to AML ( BOX 1 ) . <br>

PMID19282830Line94 Sixteen of 30 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutation - positive CMML patients ( 53 % ) progressed to AML compared with 17 of 51 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutationnegative patients ( 33 % ) ( P = 0 . 102 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line45 The e19 / a2 type <font color="blue">BCR</font> / ABL mRNA transcript ( p230 ) that was initially reported as the molecular basis for some cases of CNL is instead now considered related to an uncommon neutrophilic variant of CML . <br>

PMID22035746Line136 Intermediate - 1 - risk patients who have anemia should be treated with either <font color="blue">erythropoietin</font> stimulating agents , testosterone enanthate ( 400 - 600 mg intramuscularly / week ) , fluoxymesterone ( 10 mg orally , 3 times a day [ t . id . ] ) , prednisone ( 0 . 5 - 1 . 0 mg / kg / day ) , danazol ( 600 mg / day ) , thalidomide ( 50 - 200 mg / day ) , or lenalidomide ( 10 mg / day ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line5 Recently , a putative tumor suppressor gene , <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> , has been identified at chromosome 10q23 . 3 , which encodes a 403 amino acid dual - specificity phosphatase containing a region of homology to tensin and auxillin . <br>
PMID23531518Line137 <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> gene sequencing was limited to 179 patients , 150 with CMML - 1 and 29 with CMML - 2 , because of limited availability of DNA . <br>
PMID22898539Line224 Scheuremann et al identified that the PR - DUB consists of BRCA1 - associated protein 1 ( <font color="blue">BAP1</font> ) and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> to deubiquitylate H2AK119 ( FIG . 2 ) . <br>
PMID22323480Line145 In contrast , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations are associated with generally good prognosis , compatible with their association with RARS , which has a protracted clinical course . <br>
PMID23619563Line115 These observations suggest an untapped resource of genetic alterations for disease prognostication and warrant the inclusion of mutation screening for <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> as laboratory correlative studies in future clinical trials and prospective observational studies . <br>
PMID22898539Line283 Current genetic and functional data suggest that mutations in epigenetic modifiers fall into at least two novel classes : one set of mutations that affect DNA hydroxymethylation ( including <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> ) , and a second set that directly regulate DNA methylation and / or the histone state ( including <font color="blue">MLL</font> , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line202 Conditional deletion of <font color="blue">Ezh2</font> in the haematopoietic compartment results in B - lymphoid defects without alterations of stem or progenitor cell function or of myelopoiesis in vivo . <br>
PMID21605981Line85 In fact , most of the cis - acting regulatory motifs for the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> mouse gene reside within a single yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) clone ( 250 kb long ) , since <font color="blue">Gata2</font> - deficient mice may be rescued from embryonic lethality with this <font color="blue">Gata2</font> - YAC transgene . <br>
PMID25465125Line43 Murine models have demonstrated that mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> are sufficient to induce a myeloid neoplasm by increased hematopoietic stem cell self - renewal and myeloid transformation . <br>
PMID23896413Line54 <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> is known to signal downstream through both Janus kinase ( JAK ) and <font color="blue">SRC</font> tyrosine kinase pathways , and the 2 classes of <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> mutations that we observed exhibit different downstream signaling and kinase inhibitor sensitivities . <br>
PMID25465125Line233 Analysis of splicing patterns in 35 <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> target genes has revealed that mutations are associated with dysregulation of cell cycle and RNA processing . <br>
PMID22210327Line21 These findings strongly suggest that , although <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> are homologous genes , they encode for proteins that are likely to play distinctly different roles in normal human cells . <br>
PMID23223431Line109 Two variations , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> R396Q ( c . 1187G A ; supplemental Figure 1 ) and <font color="blue">NEK11</font> D87Y , both genes located on the chromosome 3 that are separated by 2 . 7 Mb , were identified in the mother and in the 3 children ' s samples but were absent in the father ' s sample . <br>
PMID25465125Line101 <font color="blue">EZH2</font> . <br>
PMID23054646Line56 Also , <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> mutations were associated with poor prognosis or higher risk of progression to AML in univariate analysis in some series but not in others . <br>

PMID21605981Line205 Restoration of either <font color="blue">Evi1</font> or <font color="blue">Gata2</font> expression in these cells prevented the failure of in vitro maintenance and proliferation of the HSC <font color="blue">Evi1</font> - / - population . <br>
PMID23223431Line209 They display the typical WHIM - associated dysfunctions of the <font color="blue">CXCR4</font> chemokine receptor pathway without mutations of <font color="blue">CXCR4</font> that are frequent in WHIM syndrome . <br>

PMID21605981Line296 In our series , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> was overexpressed in 37 . 4 % of cases ( 97 / 259 ) , showing that this might a recurrent event in AML . <br>
PMID24986690Line134 Compared with PMF patients , those with the myelodysplastic syndrome associated with bone marrow fibrosis have more profound cytopenia and lower circulating <font color="blue">CD34</font> - positive cell count . <br>
PMID21605981Line60 The <font color="blue">GATA2</font> protein , like other vertebrate GATA transcription factors , contains a conserved DNA - binding domain composed of two multifunctional ZnF domains ( N - ZnF and C - ZnF ) of the Cys - X2 - Cys - X17 - Cys - X2 - Cys type . <br>
PMID22323480Line158 Other mutations , including those in <font color="blue">LUC7L2</font> , <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> , and <font color="blue">PRPF8</font> , appear to be less prevalent , and , because of the small number of positive cases within the already large cohort studied , we were unable to establish whether these mutations correlated with characteristic phenotypic features and survival . <br>
PMID23054646Line61 When expressed in HeLa cells , the S34F <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> allele induces global defects of splicing , causing abnormal retention of intronic sequences in a wide variety of mature mRNA species . <br>
PMID25465125Line250 Mutations in the cohesin gene family members ( mainly <font color="blue">STAG1</font> , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">PDS5B</font> , and <font color="blue">RAD21</font> ) have been recently reported in myeloid neoplasms . <br>
PMID19282830Line123 One patient each had trisomy 13 and trisomy 21 in the whole cohort of CMML patients ; it is of note that both patients harbored <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line181 Mutations in <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> have been shown to confer adverse overall survival in patients with cytogenetically defined intermediate - risk AML , and mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> confer adverse overall survival in this risk - subset of AML regardless of <font color="blue">FLT3</font> mutational status . <br>
PMID22035746Line154 However , the demonstrated oncogenecity in transgenic mice provides a reasonable rationale for <font color="blue">JAK2</font> inhibition as a targeted treatment strategy . <br>
PMID23619563Line81 However , when the four mutations were considered individually , only <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations retained their significance in the context of IPSS ( HR : 2 . 02 ; P < 0 . 001 ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line132 The allele burden varies greatly ( between 1 % and 100 % ) from patient to patient at the time of first diagnosis , and low levels of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F are not uncommon . <br>
PMID23223431Line143 His younger brother ( patient number 7109 ; P4 , III , 3 ) presented at the age of 15 with severe meningococcal infection associated with mild hematologic abnormalities and an identical <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation . <br>

PMID22898539Line166 Using an enhanced sequence - specific approach to examine methylation status , IDH - mutant AMLs were found to have a unique methylation profile that is distinct from AMLs arising from <font color="blue">MLL</font> translocations . <br>
PMID19282830Line143 Christiansen et al . observed that <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in chemotherapyrelated MDS were associated with a shorter time to AML transformation , and missense mutations had a shorter survival than those with frameshift or nonsense patterns . <br>
PMID22878824Line139 Some studies in the overall AML population and in patients with intermediate risk reported no significant effect of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations on survival outcomes , whereas other studies have shown a negative prognostic effect in the overall population or specific subgroups . <br>
PMID24986690Line96 No difference in OS was observed between patients with type 1 and those with type 2 <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation ( P = . 235 ) , and between patients with type 2 <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation and those with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) ( P = . 311 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line200 On the other hand , Yuasa et al reported that the oncogenic transcription factor <font color="blue">EVI1</font> regulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation through <font color="blue">GATA2</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line318 In this disease , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> is a marker predictive of poor outcome . <br>
PMID25465125Line238 In Wu ' s study , <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> mutation was found to be an independent poor - risk factor for OS in all patients ( P = 0 . 030 ) and could predict a shorter time - to - leukemia transformation in younger patients ( P = 0 . 020 ) , particularly in lower - risk MDS patients . <br>
PMID24986690Line80 Patients carrying a <font color="blue">CALR</font> mutation had a lower risk of thrombosis than those carrying <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) ( P = . 021 ) , whereas no significant difference was observed by comparing the other genotypic subgroups . <br>
PMID22898539Line265 Treatment with ATRA results in a loss of PRC2 recruitment by <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha while <font color="blue">PRC1</font> - mediated gene repression persists in an ATRA - insensitive manner . <br>
PMID22878824Line305 However , outcomes in favorable - risk patients who have c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations are more similar to those of patients with intermediate - risk karyotype , and these patients should be considered for either clinical trials targeted toward the molecular abnormality or consolidation strategies similar to those used in the intermediate - risk group . <br>
PMID24986690Line88 After adjusting for age , the risk of leukemic transformation remained higher in triple - negative patients compared with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant patients ( P = . 04 ) , whereas the significance of the difference between triple - negative and <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients was borderline ( P = . 052 ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line232 The degree of functional redundancy between <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in the erythroid - megakaryocyte differentiation pathway remains the subject of active investigation . <br>
PMID23978506Line41 The <font color="blue">JAK2</font> gene maps to chromosome band 9p24 and encodes a tyrosine kinase protein composed of 1132 amino acids . <br>
PMID23223431Line203 <font color="blue">GATA2</font> might be this putative mutator gene suggested by Minelli et al <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutation could act as a preleukemic event followed by an overt transformation due to the loss of genes located in the long arm of chromosome 7 . <br>
PMID23978506Line154 For qualitative <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F testing , the report should clearly indicate a final analytic result ( eg , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation DETECTED or <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation NOT DETECTED ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line64 C - ZnF is essential for <font color="blue">GATA1</font> function , since it is responsible for the recognition of the GATA consensus sequence and consequent binding to DNA . <br>
PMID24986690Line126 <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant ET and <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant PMF have a relatively indolent clinical course compared with the respective <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant disorders . <br>
PMID22878824Line132 In this latter subgroup , presence of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or mutations was associated with significantly increased 3 - year OS rate compared with patients with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD and without <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutations ( 89 % vs . 31 % ; P < . 0001 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line69 As shown in Figure 1A , <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients had a lower cumulative incidence of anemia compared with <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant ( P < . 001 ) , <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant ( P = . 004 ) , and triple - negative patients ( P < . 001 ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line266 This explains , at least in part , the lack of efficacy of ATRA in <font color="blue">PLZF</font> - RARalpha - positive APL ( FIG . 4 ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line95 The <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation has been shown to be associated NK - AML with a reported frequency of 48 % to 53 % . <br>
PMID24335498Line156 However , in CN - AML patients , in patients with mutated <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , and in the <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutated / <font color="blue">FLT3</font> wild - type subgroup of patients , cohesin mutations had no impact on outcome . <br>

PMID23531518Line86 The only notable difference was that patients with the <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations had a higher percentage of BM ring sideroblast ( P < 0 . 0001 ) , lower median WBC ( P = 0 . 04 ) and a lower ALC ( P = 0 . 045 ) . <br>
PMID21339759Line52 Furthermore , we performed a survival analysis taking both <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations into account , as <font color="blue">TET2</font> - mutated patients showed a better survival in our first analysis ( Figure 1c ) . <br>
PMID25465125Line232 The <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> / <font color="blue">U2AF35</font> gene is located at 21q22 . 3 and encodes U2 auxiliary factor protein , which recognizes the AG splice acceptor dinucleotide at the 3 end of introns during RNA splicing . <br>
PMID22323480Line167 We did not observe widespread defective splicing , but rather distinct changes in specific introns , as seen in <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , that would functionally have the same effect as <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25465125Line252 In another cohort , mutated <font color="blue">STAG2</font> was found in 6 % of patients with MDS , both low - grade ( RCMD ) and high - grade ( RAEB ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line85 Similarly , overall survival was significantly worse for CMML patients with <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID24335498Line40 Other relevant genes were assessed for frequently occurring mutations or expression levels as previously described ( ie , <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD , <font color="blue">nucleophosmin1</font> [ <font color="blue">NPM1</font> ] , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , and <font color="blue">MLL5</font> ) . <br>

PMID25006131Line84 Among <font color="blue">STAG2</font> sequence alterations , 62 out of 63 predicted loss of function , including frameshift ( n = 19 ) , splice site ( n = 10 ) , and / or nonsense ( n = 33 ) mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line189 By contrast , <font color="blue">PRC1</font> is more appropriately thought of as a collection of different complexes on the basis of genomic duplication of the core <font color="blue">PRC1</font> complex between D . melanogaster and mammalian evolutionary development . <br>
PMID21605981Line206 When the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> promoter region was analyzed , they found that <font color="blue">EVI1</font> directly binds to the <font color="blue">Gata2</font> promoter as an enhancer , showing that <font color="blue">Gata2</font> is one of critical targets for <font color="blue">EVI1</font> and that transcription factors regulate the HSC pool hierarchically . <br>
PMID19282830Line103 <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations have been described in chemotherapyrelated MDS , MDS of atomic bomb survivors or in de novo MDS , whereas <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations were rarely reported in CMML . <br>
PMID22898539Line84 Of note , in the vast majority of cases the remaining <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> allele remains wild - type , suggesting that <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> haploinsufficiency is sufficient to contribute to myeloid transformation . <br>

PMID21605981Line48 Given the fact that both <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> have key roles in controlling the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells , defects arising from mutations in these genes have long been suspected as possible contributions to hematopoietic disorders , including leukemia . <br>
PMID23978506Line164 Reports of quantitative <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F assays should include a statement of qualitative results ( eg , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation DETECTED ) , as well as a statement of quantitative allele burden . <br>

Adopted and modified based on Li KK et al . , Semin Hematol 2013 ; 50 : 48 - 60 and http : / / www . activemotif . com / stem - cell - identity . ( A ) DNA methylation is regulated by DNMT3 as hemi - methylated form and maintained by <font color="blue">DNMT1</font> to full - methylated DNA . Mutations ( red fond ) impair DNA methylation . ( B ) DNMTs add methyl group in C5 ( carbon 5 ) position of cytosines to produce 5mC , while TETs catalyze 5mC to 5hmC , then some other factors turn 5hmC back to cytosine . ( C ) There are two polycomb repressive complexes , 1 and 2 , and constitute totally different components as shown . PRC2 is incorporated to chromatin which allows trimethylation of histone H3 Lys27 by <font color="blue">EZH2</font> . The consequence of trimethylation of Lys27 is to recruit <font color="blue">PRC1</font> via <font color="blue">CBX</font> . <font color="blue">PRC1</font> interacts with nonadjacent regions of chromatin that further represses gene expression the function of H2AK119ub1 is to repress transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II . The <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> gene regulates epigenesis through interaction with PRC2 while the PRC2 complex serves to put 1 - 3 methyl groups on the 27th lysine residue of histone H3 ( H3K27 ) . Mutations in <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> alter Polycomb functions so as to cause inappropriate differentiation and perpetual self - renewal of cancer stem cells .

PMID24986690Line131 Ongoing investigations are trying to identify the molecular basis of PMF with nonmutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , <font color="blue">CALR</font> , or <font color="blue">MPL</font> , and to better define the distinctive features of these patients . <br>
PMID21339759Line47 Also , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations were neither associated with CMML subtype , dysplastic / myeloproliferative characteristics , age , karyotype , white blood cell count , platelets count , hemoglobin or gender ( Supplementary Information 2 ) . <br>
PMID22210327Line10 Following the identification of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations , this strategy has recently led to the discovery that two homologous genes , i . e . <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">BCORL1</font> , are recurrently mutated in AML . <br>
PMID25465125Line234 The recurrent mutation of <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> is a missense mutation affecting the serine at codon 34 ( Ser34 ) ( 8 . 7 % of de novo MDS ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line92 Thus , in early erythroid progenitors <font color="blue">GATA2</font> binds to GATA motifs that reside in five discrete regions within the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> gene ( - 77 , - 3 . 9 , - 2 . 8 , - 1 . 8 and + 9 . 5 kb from the IS exon ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line253 This results in decreased global arginine methylation of the <font color="blue">PRMT5</font> targets histone H2A and histone H4 and in altered haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion and erythroid differentiation . <br>

PMID25006131Line28 Somatic loss of function of <font color="blue">HDAC8</font> impairs <font color="blue">SMC3</font> deacetylation , leading to decreased cohesin occupancy and altered transcriptional programs , underscoring a role for cohesin in gene regulation . <br>
PMID25465125Line162 Heritable <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations are associated with deafness , lymphedema , mononuclear cytopenias , susceptibility to infections , familial myelodysplasia ( MDS ) , and AML . <br>
PMID25006131Line124 A subset of these patients had mutations in cohesin complex members and reduced expression of <font color="blue">STAG2</font> / <font color="blue">RAD21</font> / <font color="blue">SMC3</font> ; indeed , we noted that most patients with cohesin mutations had reduced expression of the entire cohesin complex . <br>
PMID21339759Line44 A similar high mutation burden was also detected in <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ( median 46 . 7 % ) , <font color="blue">TET2</font> ( median 44 . 6 % ) and <font color="blue">CBL</font> ( median 42 . 5 % ) , whereas the burden was low in RAS pathway alterations , that is , <font color="blue">NRAS</font> ( median 11 . 1 % ) , <font color="blue">KRAS</font> ( median 27 % ) or <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutations ( median 6 . 9 % ) . <br>
PMID21605981Line278 However , there are few studies analyzing the role of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in hematological malignancies . <br>
PMID22323480Line195 Figure 1 . Somatic spliceosomal gene ( <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , <font color="blue">LUC7L2</font> , <font color="blue">PRPF8</font> , and <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> ) mutations as detected by next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) and Sanger sequencing technologies . ( A ) With the use of an NGS - based whole exome sequencing analysis of whole BM DNA from a patient with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia ( left ) , a mutation of <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> ( 21q22 . 3 ) at position 44514 777 ( T > C ) was detected in 13 of 18 reads . Analysis of DNA from CD3 + cells showed a much lower frequency of the base change ( 2 of 15 reads ; right ) , highlighting the somatic nature of this alteration . The finding was confirmed by Sanger sequencing . Arrows and bars indicate the specific nucleotide and predicted codon , respectively . It should be noted that <font color="blue">U2AF1</font> is expressed from the minus strand ; therefore , the NGS presentation ( top panels ) is complementally reversed in comparison to the Sanger sequencing results ( middle panels ) . This heterozygous somatic mutation results in the predicted nucleotide change 470 A > G in exon 6 of the coding region , which lead to the amino acid change Q157R in the second zinc finger domain . In the entire cohort , 27 mutations were observed in 26 patients , including a whole gene deletion . All 26 missense mutations were located in 1 of the 2 zinc finger domains ( ZNFs ) ; 2 residues , S34 or Q157 , were frequently affected ( bottom panels ) . RRM indicates RNA recognition motif . ( B ) With the use of an NGS analysis of a patient with CMML ( middle left ) , a mutation of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> ( 2q33 . 1 ) at position 198 267 491 ( C > G ) was detected in 9 of 24 reads . The somatic nature of this alteration was confirmed by an analogous analysis of the CD3 + fraction , with the change being less frequent ( 2 of 23 ; middle right ) . The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing ( bottom ) . This heterozygous somatic mutation results in the nucleotide change 1866 G > T in exon 14 of <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , resulting in the amino acid change E622D in the HSH155 domain . Analysis of the entire cohort identified mutations in 33 patients , including a case with a whole gene deletion . ( C ) Further screening by NGS led to the detection of a nonsense mutation ( R27X ) in <font color="blue">LUC7L2</font> ( 7q34 ; top ) which participates in the recognition of splice donor sites in association with the U1 <font color="blue">snRNP</font> spliceosomal subunit , and a missense mutation ( M1307I ) in <font color="blue">PRPF8</font> ( 17p13 . 3 ; bottom ) which is a large U5 <font color="blue">snRNP</font> - specific protein essential for pre - mRNA splicing . RS indicates serine / arginine - rich domain ; U5 2 - snRNA bdg , U5 - snRNA binding site 2 ; and MPN , Mpr1p , Pad1p N - terminal domain . ( D ) Mutations of <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> , an arginine / serine - rich splicing factor , were detected in 29 cases among the entire cohort , including 2 whole gene deletions and a microdeletion within the gene ( top ) . All mutations were heterozygous and affected P95 . The somatic nature of the P95R mutation was confirmed with whole BM and T - cell rich fraction DNAs ( bottom ) . ( E ) Anonsense mutation ( W153X ) was found in <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> , another arginine / serine - rich splicing regulatory factor , in a case of CMML . <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> is located at Xp22 . 2 , and the nonsense mutation was hemizygous in this male case ( BM ) . <br>

PMID21714648Line134 More than one quarter ( 26 % ) of the samples with at least one <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutation had two distinct <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations , suggesting that biallelic loss of wild - type <font color="blue">TET2</font> contributes to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes in some cases . <br>

PMID23896413Line105 Future experience with these agents will inform whether complete hematologic remissions and indepth molecular responses are realized , similar to experience with TKIs in CML and <font color="blue">PDGFRA</font> / B - rearranged myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia . <br>
PMID22898539Line227 Interestingly , among patients with AML , <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations seem to occur in an age - dependent manner and are more enriched in AML from an antecedent haematological disorder rather than in de novo AML . <br>

PMID22323480Line24 The application of high - throughput molecular technologies , including high - density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays ( SNP - As ) and new sequencing technologies has led to the improved characterization of genomic lesions such as chromosomal aberrations and of somatic mutations affecting specific classes of genes , including signal transducers ( eg , <font color="blue">CBL</font> ) , apoptotic genes ( eg , <font color="blue">TP53</font> and RAS ) , genes involved in epigenetic regulation of DNA ( eg , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 , and <font color="blue">TET2</font> ) , and histone modifiers ( eg , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> , <font color="blue">UTX</font> , and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line95 There is a dearth of follow - up information for <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutation analysis , likely because of the low number of cases identified to date . <br>
PMID23223431Line219 Screening of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in patients with mild chronic neutropenia associated with monocytopenia may be important . <br>
PMID21605981Line177 In mice , <font color="blue">Gata2</font> is expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells and its level gradually declines during cell maturation into different blood cell lineages . <br>
PMID23978506Line139 Assays with adequate analytic sensitivity are required for the sensitive detection of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F , because the mutation may be present in a small fraction of the neoplastic clonal cell population . <br>
PMID25465125Line186 A recent study of 132 patients non - RARS - T MDS demonstrated that the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutation was apparently associated with lower progression to AML and a trend to better overall survival . <br>

PMID22878824Line108 Studies have shown that <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - TKD mutations can occur in a subgroup of patients with the prognostically favorable <font color="blue">NPM1</font> or <font color="blue">CEBPA</font> mutations . <br>
PMID25465125Line40 <font color="blue">TET2</font> mutations lead to increased self renewal of hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid hyperplasia . <br>
PMID22898539Line230 Recent work suggests that <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations are bona fide loss - of - function mutations , and that <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> loss results in loss of the transcriptionally repressive H3K27 trimethylation . <br>
PMID21605981Line8 <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> are expressed principally in hematopoietic lineages , and have essential roles in the development of multiple hematopoietic cells , including erythrocytes and megakaryocytes . <br>

PMID23978506Line165 The allele burden may be expressed as a ratio of mutant ( mut ) to wild - type ( wt ) alleles , or more commonly , as a percentage of mutated <font color="blue">JAK2</font> alleles , calculated as ( <font color="blue">JAK2mut</font> ) / ( <font color="blue">JAK2mut</font> + <font color="blue">JAK2wt</font> ) x100 . <br>
PMID23223431Line32 Subsequent analysis of the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry allowed the identification of 10 additional patients with <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations in 6 pedigrees with unexplained mild neutropenia in at least 1 patient of the pedigree . <br>
PMID22898539Line255 Although these findings reveal novel insights into noncanonical functions of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> , many questions remain . <br>
PMID25465125Line144 In AML , <font color="blue">ETV6</font> mutation caused a loss of repressor activity , suggesting that <font color="blue">ETV6</font> might have tumor suppressor features . <br>
PMID25465125Line152 How the <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutation regulates proliferative signaling remains unknown . <br>
PMID21605981Line248 Moreover , although <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> can inhibit <font color="blue">GATA2</font> expression , the generation of mast cells requires cooperated functions of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and <font color="blue">PU . 1</font> . <br>
PMID22035746Line19 In 2005 , it was observed that many patients with " classic <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative " MPDs ( PV , ET , and PMF ; Figure 1 ) carried the somatic mutation JAK2V617F , which had important implications for classification , diagnosis , and potential targeted therapy . <br>
PMID23896413Line56 In contrast , <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> membrane proximal mutations strongly activate the JAK / signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway and are sensitive to JAK kinase inhibitors such as ruxolitinib . <br>
PMID22210327Line46 Analysis of a large series of CN - AML patients suggests that <font color="blue">BCOR</font> mutations may confer a poorer prognosis . <br>
PMID25465125Line188 The <font color="blue">CBL</font> ( Casitas B - lineage lymphoma ) gene , located at 11q23 . 3 , encodes a protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that is thought to be a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) signaling driving the oncogenesis pathway . <br>
PMID23978506Line24 In ET and PMF , <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F mutations and / or <font color="blue">MPL</font> exon 10 mutations are present in approximately 60 % to 70 % of patients , with no other well - defined , recurrent <font color="blue">JAK2</font> or <font color="blue">MPL</font> mutations found in the remaining patients . <br>
PMID21714648Line95 Eight of the 33 <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutant samples ( 24 . 2 % ) had abnormalities of chromosome 17 ( P < 0 . 001 ) , suggesting that mutation and chromosomal loss are frequently found together , abrogating the activity of wildtype <font color="blue">TP53</font> . <br>
PMID22323480Line121 Overall , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations were less prevalent in patients with advanced forms of MDS , indicating that mutation of this factor does not contribute to progression ( Figure 2A ) . <br>
PMID22898539Line145 Importantly , conditional <font color="blue">TET2</font> loss in the haematopoietic compartment leads to the development of myeloid leukaemia , most accurately characterized as CMML . <br>
PMID23531518Line13 CMML is characterized by persistent peripheral blood ( PB ) monocytosis > 1 x 109 / l , absence of the <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> fusion , absence of rearrangements of the <font color="blue">PDGFRA</font> or <font color="blue">PDGFRB</font> genes , absence of > = 20 % myeloblasts or promonocytes in the blood and bone marrow ( BM ) and presence of dysplasia in one or more myeloid lineages . <br>
PMID22878824Line161 However , based on the substantial difference in relapse - free survival data between the Intermediate I and Intermediate II groups defined by ELN , the NCCN has continued to place NK - AML with <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD mutations in the unfavorable risk group rather than the intermediate risk group ( see " Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities , " on page 995 ) . <br>
PMID23223431Line193 The majority of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> mutations have been identified in MDS / AML , Emberger , or MonoMAC syndrome patients . <br>
PMID23896413Line61 Under normal circumstances , the <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> ligand , granulocyte - colony stimulating factor ( G - <font color="blue">CSF</font> ) , promotes growth and survival of myeloid precursor cells , ultimately leading to differentiation of these myeloid precursors into neutrophils . <br>
PMID23978506Line103 Allele - specific qPCR also allows for quantification of the mutant as a percentage of all of the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> alleles , as an estimate of disease burden . <br>
PMID20601954Line21 This region was shared by 13 out of 14 subjects with deletions , as well as by the two subjects with UPD , and encompassed two genes , <font color="blue">CUL1</font> and <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ( Fig . 1a and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . <br>
PMID24986690Line135 In addition , they do not carry <font color="blue">JAK2</font> ( V617F ) , which is instead found in two - thirds of PMF patients . <br>
PMID22898539Line130 <font color="blue">TET1</font> , but not <font color="blue">TET2</font> , can recruit Polycomb repressive complexes ( PRCs ) through direct binding to the trans criptional regulator <font color="blue">SIN3A</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line220 Moreover , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> inhibits the erythroid differentiation through the regulation of EPO , which is the major growth factor that controls the red blood cell production through the promotion of survival , proliferation and differentiation of the erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow . <br>
PMID25465125Line145 <font color="blue">ETV6</font> mutation was recently found in the patients with MDS transformed to chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . <br>
PMID21605981Line238 However , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> and <font color="blue">GATA3</font> replacement strains displayed significant thrombocytopenia , with 2 to 3 - fold reductions in platelet counts . <br>
PMID23978506Line17 Laboratory tests for these mutations have become standard in assessing clinically suspected <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPN . <br>
PMID22898539Line169 In addition , the expression of <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> mutants in mouse bone - marrow - derived cells induced the expression of markers associated with immature ( less differentiated ) cells , a phenotype that is similar to <font color="blue">Tet2</font> - knockdown or <font color="blue">Tet2</font> - knockout cells . <br>
PMID22898539Line143 In vitro studies have shown that short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) - mediated silencing of <font color="blue">TET2</font> expression leads to impaired haematopoietic differentiation . <br>
PMID23054646Line29 Finally , a U2 snRNP complex replaces <font color="blue">SF1</font> bound to the branchpoint sequence with one of its subcomponent , <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> , to establish a splicing A complex ( Fig . 1 ) . <br>
PMID23896413Line90 <font color="blue">CSF3R</font> and <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutational overlap . <br>
PMID21714648Line130 Even though these measures are integrated into the IPSS , <font color="blue">TP53</font> mutations remained strongly associated with shorter overall survival after adjustment for IPSS risk group ( P < 0 . 001 ) , indicating that these mutations adversely affect survival through other means ( Fig . 5 in the Supplementary Appendix ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line22 Mutation analysis was performed by sequencing the nine exons and adjacent intronic splice - junction regions of <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> . <br>
PMID21605981Line189 Furthermore , Pimanda et al described a regulatory circuit among <font color="blue">GATA2</font> , <font color="blue">FLI1</font> and SCL / <font color="blue">TAL1</font> , leading to the notion that switching on the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> / <font color="blue">FLI1</font> / SCL triad could be a prerequisite for specifying HSCs . <br>
PMID23223431Line107 Five SNVs were identified further and confirmed by classic Sanger sequencing : <font color="blue">EPHB6</font> T483P , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> R396Q , <font color="blue">IMPG2</font> P1161L , <font color="blue">NEK11</font> D87Y , and <font color="blue">TTN</font> P4737R . <br>
PMID22898539Line274 In addition , mutations in specific epigenetic modifiers including <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> and <font color="blue">MLL</font> predict benefit from dose - intensified induction therapy with daunorubicin , which suggests that these mutant disease alleles affect the response to classical cytotoxic therapies . <br>
PMID23054646Line39 The majority of the <font color="blue">ZRSR2</font> mutated cases were male , in which single mutations resulted in complete loss of functions . <br>
PMID22898539Line232 The intersection of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> - bound genomic regions - as identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high - throughput sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) - and gene expression profiling resulted in the identification of specific targets of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> , including the HOXA cluster of genes , the expression of which increases with <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> loss or mutation . <br>
PMID24335498Line88 Of the 5 patients with <font color="blue">STAG2</font> mutations , 2 patients were female and 3 were male . <br>
PMID21605981Line78 In addition , the <font color="blue">GATA2</font> protein contains putative modification motifs , through which cellular signals can regulate the stability of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in hematopoietic cells . <br>
PMID22898539Line90 The clinical and prognostic implications of <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations in chronic myeloid malignancies are not yet clarified . <br>
PMID19282830Line142 Harada et al . found that patients with de novo or secondary MDS / AML carrying <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations had a significantly poorer overall survival than those without mutations . <br>
PMID22898539Line217 The possible role of <font color="blue">PRC1</font> alterations in myeloid malignancies . <br>
PMID25006131Line18 The cohesin complex is composed of 2 long structural maintenance proteins , <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> and <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , which heterodimerize at the hinge domain , forming a closed loop by binding at the alpha - klesin end to <font color="blue">RAD21</font> and adapter proteins <font color="blue">STAG1</font> / <font color="blue">STAG2</font> . <br>
PMID24335498Line89 Both patients with <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> mutations were male . <br>
PMID25465125Line132 Interestingly , these mutations appeared to co - occur in patients who had <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> and <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations and were associated with inferior OS and higher risk of leukemic transformation . <br>
PMID10706759Line106 Fig . 3 . ( A ) SSCP analysis of <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> exon 5 . Altered mobility band ( arrowhead ) present in PCR products amplified from the leukemia cell line U937 DNA is seen in lane 3 . ( B ) The result of sequencing of the altered band shows a 4 - bp ( CCCG ) insertion at nucleotide 1423 . <br>
PMID23531518Line127 <font color="blue">SF3B1</font> mutations are commonly associated with myeloid neoplasms expressing ring sideroblasts . <br>
PMID22898539Line182 By contrast , mutations in <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">IDH2</font> seem to be significantly associated with mutations in <font color="blue">NPM1</font> , and <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - <font color="blue">IDH1</font> or <font color="blue">NPM1</font> - <font color="blue">IDH2</font> co - mutant patients comprise a subset of intermediate - risk AML with remarkably favourable clinical outcome . <br>
PMID20601954Line65 Aberrations of <font color="blue">EZH2</font> at chromosome 7q36 . 1 were detected in 29 bone marrow samples from 126 individuals with MDS . Genomic sequencing of the coding region and the splice donor and acceptor sites revealed missense mutations , donor - splice - site mutations , deletions and insertions , predicting amino acid substitutions and truncations . <br>
PMID24986690Line92 Median OS was 17 . 7 years in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant , 9 . 2 years in <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant , 9 . 1 years in <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant , and 3 . 2 years in triple - negative patients , as shown in Figure 4 . <br>
PMID23978506Line244 Full sequencing of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> , as well as other genes relevant for MPNs , may be performed in this manner . <br>
PMID23054646Line16 For example , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> are among most frequent targets of gene mutations in both MDS and normal karyotype AML . <br>
PMID23896413Line86 In aCML , the majority of <font color="blue">SETBP1</font> mutations are located in a 14 amino acid stretch that is also mutated in Schinzel - Giedion syndrome , a rare genetic disease characterized by congenital malformations , mental retardation , and a high prevalence of epithelial tumors . <br>
PMID21605981Line304 Outside the hematopoietic system , <font color="blue">GATA2</font> collaborates in the development of the endothelial cells , adipocytes , and the nervous system . <br>
PMID22898539Line295 Mutational frequencies of <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> are listed as reported in the original referenced manuscripts ( this may include the controversial <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> pGly646fsX12 variant ( REF . 83 ) ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line274 Notably , however , in patients with <font color="blue">CBF</font> AML who were treated with postremission therapy with high - dose cytarabine , the presence of c - <font color="blue">KIT</font> mutations resulted in poorer outcomes . <br>
PMID25465125Line269 Fig . 3 . The cohesin complex . Adopted and modified based on Ocampo - Hafalla M T , and Uhlmann F J . Cell Sci 2011 ; 124 : 685 - 691 . <font color="blue">SCC</font> family members include <font color="blue">SA1</font> and <font color="blue">SA2</font> in vertebrate , which are encoded by <font color="blue">STAG1</font> and <font color="blue">STAG2</font> . The cohesin complex is composed of <font color="blue">ATP</font> - bound proteins including <font color="blue">SMC1</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , and <font color="blue">SCC1</font> forming an embracing ring . Pds5 , Scc3 and Wpl1 proteins interact with the ring and modulate its function . Cohesin is loaded on the chromosomes prior to DNA replication with the help of <font color="blue">Scc2</font> / <font color="blue">Scc4</font> cohesin loader . During loading reaction , the <font color="blue">ATP</font> bound between <font color="blue">SMC3</font> / <font color="blue">SMC1</font> head domains is hydrolyzed , which is catalyzed by the <font color="blue">Scc2</font> - <font color="blue">Scc4</font> complex . Once the new complex is formed , cohesin is enabled to encircle the DNA , which allows translocation of cohesin rings along the DNA in response to transcription , leading to their accumulation between convergent gene pairs ( RNA - polymerase - II - transcribed genes and their direction of transcription ) . During DNA replication it is acetylated by <font color="blue">Eco1</font> acetyltransferase . The release of cohesin from DNA happens at the beginning of the anaphase and <font color="blue">SCC1</font> subunit is cleaved by separase , a protease . Cohesin is deacetylated by Hos1 deacetylase and released from chromosomes . Mutations in cohesin complex will lead to abnormal mitosis or meiosis . Note : * frequent mutation site . <br>

PMID22878824Line121 In another study , IDH mutations ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> and <font color="blue">IDH2</font> combined ) were associated with significantly inferior 5 - year relapse - free survival rates ( 37 % vs . 67 % ; P = . 02 ) and OS rates ( 41 % vs . 65 % ; P = . 03 ) in the subgroup of patients with favorable - risk AML ( normal karyotype with <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutation without <font color="blue">FLT3</font> - ITD ) . <br>
PMID22878824Line157 ELN classifies patients with t ( 9 ; 11 ) ( p22 ; q23 ) , <font color="blue">MLLT3</font> - <font color="blue">MLL</font> and other cytogenetic abnormalities that fall into neither the favorable or adverse category into the " Intermediate II " group . <br>
PMID22035746Line92 Current treatments for <font color="blue">BCR</font> - <font color="blue">ABL1</font> - negative MPN are considered noncurative and focus primarily on reducing the risk of complications . <br>
PMID23978506Line148 How Should the Results of <font color="blue">JAK2</font> and <font color="blue">MPL</font> Mutation Testing Be Reported ? <br>
PMID19282830Line28 In this study , we analyzed a large cohort of patients with CMML to define the prevalence and types of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID20601954Line66 Sequences were compared to the reference genomic sequence NT _ 007914 . 15 and the deduced protein sequences were compared to reference <font color="blue">NP _ 004447 . 2</font> . In subjects 44 and 104 , the 7q deletion that was identified on the SNP array was missed by karyotype analysis . In subject 43 , the 7q deletion that was revealed by karyotype analysis was not detected by a SNP array analysis . <br>
PMID24986690Line142 We did not find major differences between <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients with the 52 - bp deletion ( type 1 mutation ) and those with the 5 - bp insertion ( type 2 mutation ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line10 As in our previous study of <font color="blue">TSG101</font> , the abnormal transcripts may result from aberrant RNA splicing as evidenced by the presence of both these aberrant transcripts and normal full length transcripts in all specimens examined . <br>
PMID21714648Line131 Furthermore , patients with mutant <font color="blue">TP53</font> and a complex karyotype had a paucity of mutations in other genes , suggesting that this group could be considered to have a distinct molecular subclass of myelodysplastic syndromes with a unique pathogenic mechanism . <br>
PMID23619563Line109 The potential prognostic value of IDH , <font color="blue">EZH2</font> and <font color="blue">SRSF2</font> mutations in PMF were previously suggested by single center studies . <br>
PMID25006131Line10 Cohesin mutations were significantly associated with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> , Ras - family oncogenes , and <font color="blue">BCOR</font> and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations and were most prevalent in high - risk MDS and secondary AML . <br>
PMID22878824Line144 Interestingly , in this latter study , non - R882 <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> mutations were significantly associated with poorer outcomes in patients younger than 60 years ( but not R882 mutations ) ; in contrast , in patients aged 60 years and older , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> - R882 mutations ( but not non - R882 mutations ) were associated with significantly decreased DFS ( 3 - year rate , 3 % vs . 21 % ; P = . 006 ) and OS ( 3 - year rate , 4 % vs . 24 % ; P = . 01 ) . <br>
PMID10706759Line8 To evaluate the role of the <font color="blue">PTEN</font> / <font color="blue">MMAC1</font> gene in leukemia , bone marrow and / or peripheral blood from 62 acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patients , 5 hemopoietic cell lines ( HL60 , U937 , Raji , KG - 1 , K562 ) , and 30 normal controls were analyzed . <br>
PMID22898539Line171 The genetic , epigenetic and functional data suggest that <font color="blue">TET2</font> and IDH mutations form a novel mutational complementation group in myeloid leukaemia , and indicate that mutational studies may identify additional disease alleles that alter DNA hydroxymethylation in different malignancies . <br>
PMID21605981Line259 In this study , they dissect the function of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in normal and aberrant megakaryopoiesis , showing that <font color="blue">GATA2</font> promotes megakaryopoiesis by driving progenitor cell proliferation and megakaryocytic lineage gene expression , while suppressing myeloid gene expression . <br>
PMID25465125Line139 However , the prognostic value of <font color="blue">ETV6</font> translocation has not been fully investigated in myeloid neoplasms . <br>
PMID24986690Line71 The cumulative incidence of thrombocytopenia was significantly lower in <font color="blue">CALR</font> - mutant patients compared with the remaining ones ( P = . 001 ) , whereas no significant difference was observed between triple - negative and <font color="blue">JAK2</font> - mutant ( P = . 292 ) or <font color="blue">MPL</font> - mutant patients ( P = . 627 ) ( Figure 1B ) . <br>
PMID23978506Line140 In a study using direct sequencing , lower frequencies of the <font color="blue">JAK2</font> V617F were found in all three classical MPN entities : 65 % in PV , 23 % in ET , and 30 % in PMF . <br>
PMID24335498Line150 In our analysis , the allelelic burden of mutations in the cohesin genes were very similar to that observed for <font color="blue">NPM1</font> mutations . <br>
PMID19282830Line144 The prognostic relevance of <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations in CMML has not been determined earlier . <br>
PMID21605981Line297 High expression of <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in AML was first reported by Shimamoto et al , who found it in 87 % of cases ( 54 / 62 ) using RT - PCR . <br>
PMID22898539Line7 In this Review we discuss recent genetic and functional data implicating mutations in epigenetic modifiers , including <font color="blue">tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2</font> ( <font color="blue">TET2</font> ) , <font color="blue">isocitrate dehydrogenase 1</font> ( <font color="blue">IDH1</font> ) , <font color="blue">IDH2</font> , <font color="blue">additional sex combs - like 1</font> ( <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ) , <font color="blue">enhancer of zeste homologue 2</font> ( <font color="blue">EZH2</font> ) and <font color="blue">DNA methyltransferase 3A</font> ( <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> ) , in the pathogenesis of MPN , MDS and AML , and discuss how this knowledge is leading to novel clinical , biological and therapeutic insights . <br>
PMID25465125Line27 Abnormalities in cytosine methylation may result from mutations in <font color="blue">TET2</font> , <font color="blue">DNMT3A</font> , and <font color="blue">IDH1</font> / 2 . <br>
PMID24335498Line20 Genes that belong to the cohesin complex in somatic vertebrate cells are <font color="blue">SMC1A</font> , <font color="blue">SMC3</font> , <font color="blue">RAD21</font> ( SCC1 ) , <font color="blue">STAG2</font> ( <font color="blue">SA - 2</font> ) , and <font color="blue">STAG1</font> ( SA - 1 ) ; these genes form a ring structure that regulates chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis . <br>
PMID23619563Line106 In line with these observations , the current study identifies additional submicroscopic genetic changes , such as <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> mutations , which cluster with normal karyotype and yet portend a poor prognosis . <br>
PMID21605981Line142 Together , these results demonstrate that the SCL complex is a crucial regulator of the positive transcriptional activity of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> and <font color="blue">GATA2</font> in several hematopoietic lineages , probably by modulating the activity of <font color="blue">GATA1</font> cofactors to specify transcriptional activation . <br>
PMID19282830Line75 Four nonsense mutations were located in the RHD that generate termination codons resulting in truncated <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> proteins . <br>
PMID25006131Line132 This includes decreased expression of signaling effectors ( <font color="blue">NRAS</font> , <font color="blue">JAK1</font> , and <font color="blue">CBL</font> ) and reduced expression of <font color="blue">HIF1A</font> , suggesting a novel mechanism of transformation for patients with myeloid malignancies characterized by alterations in the cohesin complex . <br>
PMID19282830Line29 In addition , the mutation status of the <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> gene was also correlated with the clinicohematological features and outcome in CMML patients to determine its clinical and prognostic relevance . <br>
PMID24335498Line32 Patients with <font color="blue">PML</font> - <font color="blue">RARA</font> or t ( 15 ; 17 ) - positive AML were excluded from these trials . <br>
PMID19282830Line90 A comparison of clinicohematological features between CMML patients with and without <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations was carried out ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . <br>
PMID19282830Line89 Of the patients with <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> mutations , 11 had normal karyotypes with one partial tandem duplication of <font color="blue">MLL</font> ; trisomy 13 , trisomy 21 , monosomy 7 and complex anomaly were detected in one patient each , and none had - 5 / 5q - ( Table 1 ) . <br>
PMID22035746Line52 <font color="blue">MPL</font> . <br>
PMID25006131Line97 When compared with the cohesin WT cohort , cooccurring mutations in <font color="blue">RUNX1</font> ( P = . 0001 ) , Ras - family oncogenes ( P = . 0001 ) , <font color="blue">BCOR</font> ( n = 15 ; P = . 003 ) , and <font color="blue">ASXL1</font> ( P = . 03 ) were significantly enriched in patients with cohesin mutations ( Figure 2 and supplemental Table 7 ) . <br>
