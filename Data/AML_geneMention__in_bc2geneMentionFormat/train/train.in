Train_Line_0 But additional elaborate studies are needed to clarify this point.

Pie chart illustrating the molecular heterogeneity of cytogenetically normal AML based on mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, MLL, FLT3 (ITD and TKD mutations at codons D835 and I836), NRAS, and WT1 genes. The bluish colors denote NPM1-mutated subsets, the orange/red colors CEBPA-mutated subsets, and the yellow/green colors MLL-mutated subsets. The gray colors depict subsets without hypothetical class II mutations, and the white sector shows the subset without any mutation in the above-mentioned genes. Data are derived from mutational analysis of 485 younger adult patients with cytogenetically normal AML from AMLSG.

Train_Line_7 Consistent with this notion, somatic mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A have been described in the hematopoietic system of elderly individuals before the occurrence of clinically apparent myeloid malignancy.
Train_Line_8 Sensitivity analysis was performed on event-free survival, and the results are displayed for exploratory purposes.
Train_Line_9 Most patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis that was not associated with a JAK2 or MPL alteration carried a somatic mutation in CALR.
Train_Line_10 The mutation could be detected in patients with t(8;21), t(15;17) (not recruited in this study), and t(7;11).
Train_Line_11 Among the 186 MDS patients with wild-type IDH1, information about progression to AML was available for 145 patients. Among these, 41 developed AML (28.4%).
Train_Line_12 In conclusion, WT1 mutations are correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients.
Train_Line_13 Only high-quality reads with a Phred score >= Q20 were included for further analysis.
Train_Line_14 Representative examples of morphologic abnormalities of myelodysplasia are reported in Figure 1.

Train_Line_16 Specifically, the LR-PSS considers features missing from the IPSS, such as patient age, and reweights others, including thrombocytopenia, anemia, and blast count (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_17 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_18 Familial MDS has been rarely reported, usually in the context of early-onset disease and germline mutations.
Train_Line_19 CBL is a multifunctional adaptor protein and was previously shown to interact with 14-3-3, JAK2 and SH2B2 (Schmidt & Dikic, 2005); we therefore speculate that SH2B3, CBL, JAK2 and 14-3-3 may participate in a multiprotein complex.
Train_Line_20 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital.
Train_Line_21 Germline DDX41 mutations, per definition, can be considered founder lesions.
Train_Line_22 Management of Low-Risk PV or ET Patients with Extreme Thrombocytosis or Abnormal Bleeding Diathesis.
Train_Line_23 Results.
Train_Line_24 Levels of expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3.
Train_Line_25 In summary, given the recent flurry of reported mutations in chromatin regulatory genes in human tumors, a functional role of deregulated histone modification in cancer biology has not yet been established.
Train_Line_26 In this large cohort of MDS patients, we found that ASXL1 mutation was statistically closely associated with trisomy 8 and mutations of RUNX1, EZH2, IDH, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1 and SRSF2, suggesting cooperation of these gene alterations with ASXL1 mutation may contribute to the development of MDS.
Train_Line_27 This is particularly true for patients with a clinical diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia, because the differential diagnosis between clonal and reactive thrombocytosis may be difficult without a clonal marker.
Train_Line_28 Sequential analyses in 173 samples from 66 patients showed that all SRSF2-mutated patients retained their original mutations, whereas none of the SRSF2-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during disease evolution.
Train_Line_29 The close relationship between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations in MDS would in principle imply that the mutant gene be associated with a mild clinical course.
Train_Line_30 TABLE I. World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_31 Clonal hierarchy analysis showed that in some cases IKZF1 deletion was a late event in the progression of the disease and was frequently related to a complex karyotype.
Train_Line_32 In parallel, the development of these epigenetic-targeted agents provide exciting reagents to probe epigenetic complexes and their roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_33 The mechanisms by which a mutant SF3B1 protein determines clonal proliferation of a CD34-positive cell have not yet been elucidated.
Train_Line_34 Its role in human hematopoiesis is unknown.
Train_Line_35 In support of this notion, it has been shown that TET2, EZH2, or ASXL1 mutations are far less frequent in PV and ET than in PMF, which combine at least 2 mutations.
Train_Line_36 A prerequisite for biobanking is the patient's informed consent that ideally should allow a broad spectrum of correlative laboratory studies that also include analysis of germline DNA.
Train_Line_37 Sequencing of exon 23 in 80 healthy volunteers did not reveal any mutations.
Train_Line_38 Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities are mostly secondary genetic events with established clinical relevance in MDS.
Train_Line_39 The BRISC complex comprises the following proteins: FAM175B/ABRO1, BRCC3/BRCC36, BRE/BRCC45 and MERIT40/NBA1.
Train_Line_40 Table 1. Genetic and clinical characteristics according to TP53 alteration.
Train_Line_41 Statistical analyses.
Train_Line_42 The paradigmatic example is refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T), which has both the myelodysplastic features of RARS and the myeloproliferative characteristics of essential thrombocythemia.
Train_Line_43 In contrast, other mutations conferring secondary resistance affect the activation loop of the kinase domain in particular residue D816, D820, N822 or Y823.
Train_Line_44 Mutations of ZRSR2, which is located on the X chromosome, was found in both males (n = 4) and females (n = 2).
Train_Line_45 Briefly, the DNA was amplified to cover both mutations, the PCR products were then cloned into the Taq polymerase-amplified cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega), and 10 clones were selected for sequencing.
Train_Line_46 Causes that include term "disease" indicate that myelodysplastic syndrome was present at time of death.
Train_Line_47 Thus far, no prognostic relevance in terms of overall survival has been clearly defined, but recent studies suggest that TET2 mutation may predict response to hypomethylating agents.
Train_Line_48 To date, risk-adapted stratification to HDAC postremission therapy in CALGB protocols has been performed on the basis of cytogenetic and molecular genetic detection of t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and or inv(16)/CBFBMYH11.
Train_Line_49 In contrast, tumor cells with wild-type RAS genes undergo marked S-phase growth arrest on exposure to cytarabine that is reversible once the drug is removed.
Train_Line_50 Around 25% of MDS patients with International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) low or intermediate-1 risk are exempt of these recurrent mutations, underscoring the need for further molecular characterization.
Train_Line_51 Definitions of response criteria are based primarily on those given by Cheson et al.
Train_Line_52 JAK2 inhibitor development is well under way as a potential therapeutic strategy for treating MPD patients with the JAK2V617F allele.
Train_Line_53 We therefore investigated patients with JAK2V617F-negative MPD for somatic activating mutations in EPOR, MPL, or GCSFR.
Train_Line_54 In contrast to NPM1 mutations, which are quite stable during disease progression, WT1 mutation status may change at relapse.
Train_Line_55 U2AF1 mutation was also associated with inferior TTL in younger patients (median 50.4 vs. 197.4 months, P = 0.020, Fig. 2G), but not in older patients (Fig. 2F).
Train_Line_56 Table 3. Abundance of patient-specific TET2 mutations across different tissues.
Train_Line_57 We could not find the treatment difference between the patients with IDH mutations and those without (data not shown).
Train_Line_58 Cells were collected and stained with FITC-rat anti-mouse CD41 antibody (BD Biosciences), followed by 50 ug/mL propidium iodide in 0.1% sodium citrate buffer with 50 ug/mL RNAase, as previously described.
Train_Line_59 In contrast, among the 86 BCOR-unmutated patients, only 22.1% (19/86) had RUNX1 mutations (P = .07 by Fisher exact test; Table 3 block D).
Train_Line_60 Allogeneic HSCT using reduced-intensity conditioning.
Train_Line_61 In the study by Wang et al somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in approximately 15% of patients, making this the second most frequently mutated gene in CLL, and were highly enriched in patients with del(11q).
Train_Line_62 We used a size cut-off of: > 270 kb for deletions, > 500 kb for gains, and > 6.9 Mb for UPD, which were based on detecting deletions (106 kb), gains (207 kb), and UPD (2.2 Mb) at the 95th percentile in normal tissue.

Train_Line_64 Two studies in the Journal now solve this puzzle and identify mutations in a specific gene in the majority of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms who have nonmutated JAK2 or MPL.
Train_Line_65 Secondary MDS-RAEB with t(5;18)(q22;q12), which subsequently evolved to MDS-related AML.
Train_Line_66 BCOR V1616fs and other concomitant mutations of UPN3 (ASXL1, CBL, RUNX1, STAG2, and SRSF2) were quantified in flow-sorted CD31 T cells, CD191 B-cells, CD34+ CD38- progenitors, and in the bulk of mononuclear BM cells.
Train_Line_67 Despite the relative ease of identifying mutations in IDH1 (which occur at Arg132) and IDH2 (which can occur at Arg140 or Arg172), the results from the correlative studies have been complicated by the fact that a number of studies (1) examined the clinical relevance of only 1 or 2 mutations of the 3 possible point mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, (2) have included a limited number of additional genetic alterations beyond IDH1/2 in the analysis, and/or (3) have studied patients receiving different therapies including dose-intense chemotherapy, transplantation, and less aggressive antileukemic therapies.
Train_Line_68 Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) associated with proteins to form particles termed small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs; Figure 1).
Train_Line_69 Patients with isolated 5q deletion with TP53 mutation also have a short median OS (23 months) compared to those with wild type TP53 and 5q deletion.
Train_Line_70 In Vitro Colony-Forming Assays.
Train_Line_71 ATRA is being used clinically for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, and recently, it has been employed successfully in AML patients with NPM mutations.
Train_Line_72 Thus, the general use of growth factors in AML cannot be recommended.
Train_Line_73 Furthermore, ASXL1 mutation was closely associated with mutations of RUNX1, EZH2, IDH, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1 and SRSF2 in MDS patients.
Train_Line_74 Invasive fungal infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with prolonged neutropenia.
Train_Line_75 In addition, somatic mutations of JAK2 exon 12 are found in polycythemia vera, and activating mutations of the thrombopoietin receptor gene MPL are present in 5 to 10% of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis with nonmutated JAK2.
Train_Line_76 Signalling by mutant KIT.
Train_Line_77 Leukemic and normal samples.
Train_Line_78 Written informed consent for analysis of leukemic samples was obtained at each participating center in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_79 The dose of hydroxyurea is titrated to keep platelet count in the normal range and leukocyte count >2 x 109/L.
Train_Line_80 SH2B3 (LNK) mutations from myeloproliferative neoplasms patients have mild loss of function against wild type JAK2 and JAK2 V617F.
Train_Line_81 To investigate the possible impact of defective DDX41 on premRNA splicing, deep whole RNA sequencing was investigated in deletion, mutant, and WT cases (Przychodzen et al, 2013).
Train_Line_82 There was also no significant correlation between SOCS1 or SOCS3 transcript level and patient's sex, age, hemoglobin level, white cell count, Lille prognostic score, platelet count, blast count or grade of fibrosis.
Train_Line_83 MPD: myeloproliferative disorder; MF: myelofibrosis; PV: polycythemia vera; ET: essential thrombocythemia.
Train_Line_84 One frameshift and 2 nonsense mutations were identified for BCORL1.
Train_Line_85 UPN, unique patient number; Het, heterozygous; INS, insertion; SIFT, sorts intolerant from tolerant substitutions; NE, not evaluable.
Train_Line_86 No methylation of TGFBR2 CpG islands was detected in PV or IMF.
Train_Line_87 Methods and Findings.
Train_Line_88 These mutations and those in RAS activate pro-proliferative and antiapoptotic signals critical for myeloid leukemogenesis and are often referred to as class I mutations.
Train_Line_89 In some but not other studies, mutant IDH2 was associated with unfavorable prognosis in cytogenetically normal AML, whereas a more recent study suggested that mutant IDH2R140 was prognostically more favorable than mutant IDH2R172.
Train_Line_90 The majority were missense mutations (n = 130), followed by deletions/insertions (n = 21); 17 resulted in premature stop; 4 preserved the open reading frame (g.13149del6, g.13149del9, g.14001del21, and g.13162ins3), nonsense mutations (n = 9), and splice site mutations (n = 8; Figure 1).
Train_Line_91 The review of clinical and hematologic data identified 57 patients with RARS-T.
Train_Line_92 Patients and Methods.
Train_Line_93 However, in some models, an ET-like disorder, usually transient, was observed.
Train_Line_94 Lastly, in a study on MDS patients with lower-risk disease, mutations of SF3B1 showed only a trend toward longer survival.
Train_Line_95 We found that U2AF1 mutation occurred more commonly in younger patients.
Train_Line_96 Patient-specific "barcodes," adapted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers in the second round of amplification, were derived from Roche GS Titanium protocol. (supplemental Table 2A).
Train_Line_97 A 200 bp fragment including partially exons 1 and 2 of BCOR was amplified using forward primer 5'-TTCACAGCTGGATGAACAGC-3' and reverse primer 5'-CGTTGTGGTTCAAGGGATTC-3'.
Train_Line_98 Since C/EBPalpha is essential for granulocytic differentiation and cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia harbor a differentiation block resulting in an excess of myeloid blasts, it was hypothesized that C/EBPalpha may be absent or mutated in myeloid leukemias.
Train_Line_99 Although all three disease entities belong to the group of myeloid malignancies, treatment approaches are different.
Train_Line_100 These results suggest that ASXL1 mutations are frequent molecular aberrations in MDS that predict an adverse prognostic outcome.
Train_Line_101 These findings suggest that the simultaneous occurrence of NPM1 and BCOR mutations is uncommon.
Train_Line_102 Neither of the above SRSF2 mutation types correlated with BM RS%.
Train_Line_103 The results of this study identify a clinical setting in which genetic profiling of tumor samples can inform care decisions for patients with MDS.
Train_Line_104 Similar to previously described spliceosomal mutations (Yoshida et al, 2011; Makishima et al, 2012), the precise mechanisms by which DDX41 lesions exert their pro-leukemogenic defects are unclear.
Train_Line_105 The pathophysiology of the disease syndrome is complex and poorly understood.
Train_Line_106 Three-year OS in patients without these mutations was 59% (95% CI, 43% to 72%), versus 19% (95% CI, 9% to 33%) in patients with these mutations.
Train_Line_107 A total of 15 truncating BCOR (4.2%) and 3 BCORL1 (0.8%) alterations were identified all over the coding regions (Figure 1A).
Train_Line_108 4.1 Morphology
Train_Line_109 HL-60 cells carrying stably transduced 4HT-regulatable GATA2 (wild-type, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) were treated with and without 100 nM 4HT.
Train_Line_110 Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed on a Stratagene MX3000P sequence detection system.
Train_Line_111 n.a. indicates not applicable to direct Sanger sequencing. In the chromatogram of these samples, the size of the mutated peak relative to the proportion of leukemic cells was consistent with a clonal event.
Train_Line_112 Treatment.
Train_Line_113 As inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases are increasingly used in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms, it is of great importance to understand the role of the recently identified mutations in DNMT3A.
Train_Line_114 They demonstrated that Pro95 of SRSF2 forms extensive contact with the RNA through stacking.
Train_Line_115 Genomic DNA was extracted from samples by using the All Prep DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Train_Line_116 RESULTS.
Train_Line_117 The high frequency of somatic alterations in epigenetic modifiers in AML patients, combined with the established clinical importance of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in the clinical management of patients with myeloid malignancies, has led to a great interest in the development of novel epigenetic therapies (Table 3).
Train_Line_118 High levels of BCR-ABL, as present in CML blast crisis, induce hnRNP-E2 expression via a MAPK-dependent mechanism.
Train_Line_119 Neither randomized trial showed a higher CR rate with HiDAC, and both demonstrated increased toxicity.
Train_Line_120 All MPNs are clonal disorders with an initial hit in the HSCs resulting in an excessive production of blood cells because of hypersensitivity or independence from normal cytokine regulation.
Train_Line_121 In a multivariate Cox regression analysis of overall survival that included type of myeloid neoplasm (essential thrombocythemia vs. primary myelofibrosis), type of mutated gene, and patient cohort (Pavia vs.
Train_Line_122 The clinical implications of mutations involving some of these splicing machinery genes, like SRSF2 and SF3B1, in MDS patients have been explored.
Train_Line_123 This included 101 patients from the German series (15 with and 86 without BCOR mutations) and 3 of 10 Italian BCOR-mutated patients with material available for analysis.
Train_Line_124 In most tissues, including hematopoietic stem cells, the number of passenger mutations is a function of age.
Train_Line_125 Among the patients with ET, those who were JAK2 V617F-positive displayed higher levels of SOCS3 within granulocytes than those who were MPL mutation-positive, reflecting the lineage specificity of MPL expression.
Train_Line_126 Four additional variants predicted by the SAVI algorithm were not confirmed by Sanger sequencing as somatic mutations; in 1 instance, the normal DNA harbored the variant, and in the other 3 instances, the variant was not present in the tumor DNA (Table 1).
Train_Line_127 Further analysis of positive and negative regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway is warranted in JAK2V617F-negative MPD.
Train_Line_128 To prevent alloimmunization, removal of contaminating leukocytes is advised.
Train_Line_129 HL-60 cells carrying stably transduced 4HT-regulatable GATA2 (wild-type, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) were treated with and without 100 nM 4HT.
Train_Line_130 In univariate analysis patients with mutations in codon R132 of IDH1 had significantly lower event-free survival (HR 2.37; 95%CI 1.10-5.11) (Figure 2B).
Train_Line_131 Median follow-up time for survival was calculated according to the method of Korn.
Train_Line_132 In conclusion, we identified mutations of SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and U2AF35 in 42.2% of MDS patients and found a strong association between the clinical phenotype and the different splice gene mutations.
Train_Line_133 Both rounds of PCR were amplified using the same conditions and consisted of: denaturation at 95--degrees--C for 10 min followed by 35 cycles of: denaturation at 95--degrees--C for 1 min, annealing at 56--degrees--C for 1 min, and extension at 72--degrees--C for 1 min; with a final extension at 72--degrees--C for 10 min.
Train_Line_134 However, SH2B3 mutations can occur concurrently with JAK2 V617F (Pardanani et al 2010; Lasho et al 2011), suggesting that these mutations may be cooperative in nature.
Train_Line_135 We performed LNK sequence analysis in 42 chronic phase MPN patients (14 polycythemia vera, 15 essential thrombocythemia, 9 primary myelofibrosis, and 4 myeloproliferative neoplasm, unclassified) and detected total three types of genetic mutations (7.1%) including p.Q423X, p.R551W and p.I568T.
Train_Line_136 Fig 1. Spectrum of mutations in 87 patients in select myelodysplastic syndrome-associated genes. Each column represents an individual patient sample, and each colored cell represents mutation of gene or gene group listed to left of that row. No. of mutations for each row is indicated in column to right. Tyrosine kinase (TK) pathway genes include JAK2, NRAS, CBL, KRAS, PTPN11, BRAF, and CBLB.
Train_Line_137 DNMT3A mutations also independently predicted a lower CR rate in multivariate analysis (OR=0.42; 95%CI, 0.21 to 0.84; P=.015; Table 2) when considering DNMT3A mutations, age, NPM1/FLT3-ITD risk group, WT1 SNP rs16754 status, and BAALC, ERG, and MN1 expression levels.
Train_Line_138 The etiology and specific factors that predispose to therapy-related myeloid neoplasms largely remain elusive.
Train_Line_139 Including respiratory failure, sepsis, infection, cardiac, bleeding, second malignancy, graft-versus-host disease, veno-occlusive disease, and other.
Train_Line_140 Oh et al reported two types of LNK mutations in 33 (6.1%) JAK2 V617F-negative MPN patients, and Lasho et al identified two mutations (25.0%) in eight JAK2 V617F-negative patients with unexplained erythrocytosis.
Train_Line_141 Mutation status of BCOR and BCORL1 among 354 MDS, 54 CMML, and 22 AML-MRC patients.
Train_Line_142 Next, we evaluated the correlation of clinical and genetic characteristics with DNMT3A mutations in all patients (Table 1).
Train_Line_143 Table 3. Novel epigenetic-targeted pharmacologic agents in preclinical development in the treatment of myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_144 Methylation and down-regulation of SOCS1 has been demonstrated in a number of hematologic malignancies including myelodysplasia and chronic myeloid leukemia although conflicting results have been obtained in some diseases.
Train_Line_145 Likewise, SOCS1 transcript level was not correlated with length of survival.
Train_Line_146 EFS was calculated by combining the 2 previous outcomes (death or leukemic transformation).
Train_Line_147 Mutations in ASXL1 were initially identified by Gelsi-Boyer et al in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_148 Therefore, cytoreductive treatment is currently not recommended for low-risk women with ET that are either pregnant or wish to be pregnant.
Train_Line_149 It is possible that imatinib or other KIT inhibitors may have a role in treatment of melanomas driven by KIT mutations, but a much fuller evaluation is required.
Train_Line_150 The cytogenetic risk group is defined according to Medical Research Council criteria.
Train_Line_151 Two Phase II trials of imatinib in metastatic melanoma with activating KIT mutations were reported recently, both showing significant benefit from drug treatment.
Train_Line_152 Patients and sample preparation.
Train_Line_153 Approximately 50 ng of DNA was used for each PCR reaction.
Train_Line_154 Risk Stratification.
Train_Line_155 The first mutation leads to a premature stop codon resulting in the absence of the PH and SH2 domains, whereas the second (E208Q) is a missense mutation in the PH domain (Figure 1B).
Train_Line_156 We found IDH mutations occurred more frequently in RAEBT (14.3%) and CMML (11.3%) than in RARS (2.9%), RAEB (2.5%), and RA (1.7%).
Train_Line_157 Mutations in ASXL1 occurred with a frequency of 20.7% in MDS (n = 40 of 193) with 70% (n = 28) of mutations being frameshift mutations and 30% (n = 12) being heterozygous point mutations leading to translational changes.
Train_Line_158 The mutation occurred more frequently in younger patients and was stable during disease evolution.
Train_Line_159 AML with FLT3 mutations are not considered a distinct entity, although determining the presence of such mutations is recommended by WHO because they have prognostic significance.
Train_Line_160 Aberrant profiles were verified by bidirectional sequencing and compared with wild-type sequence (GenBank; X54156).
Train_Line_161 Patients with induction failure who are not eligible for allogeneic HSCT should be considered for clinical trials evaluating novel agents.

Train_Line_164 Early molecular modelling work indicated that substitution of D816 in KIT destabilised intramolecular interactions in the inactive conformation of the kinase domain and markedly favoured the active conformation.
Train_Line_165 In the majority of patients with AML who achieve a CR, the leukemia will recur within 3 years after diagnosis.
Train_Line_166 All molecular analyses were conducted in a blinded fashion on DNA extracted from cryopreserved cells taken at the time of diagnosis.
Train_Line_167 The authors concluded that the presence of a RAS mutation may change cellular response to cytarabine from cytostatic to cytotoxic, most likely because of altered cellular checkpoint functions in response to cytarabine.
Train_Line_168 Ultimately, modeling these mutations in an organism will be required to understand their transforming potential.
Train_Line_169 The majority (seven out of eight) of the truncating mutations in the patients resulted in loss of the C terminus SRI domain (Fig. 2a), which is responsible for the recruitment of SETD2 to its target gene locus through binding to the phosphor-C-terminal repeat domain (PCTD) of elongating RNA polymerase II (Pol II).
Train_Line_170 For loading controls, blots were stripped and reprobed using anti-JAK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, United States), anti-TYK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-STAT3 (Cell Signaling), anti-ERK (Cell Signaling), antiAKT (Cell Signaling), and anti-TYK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies as appropriate.
Train_Line_171 C/EBPalpha is a critical transcription factor that controls tissue-specific gene expression and proliferation arrest, thereby coordinately regulating two essential features of terminally differentiated cells.
Train_Line_172 Cell numbers were determined by manual counting, and FACS analysis (Phycoerythrin anti-mouse CD11b and Phycoerythrin rat IgG2b isotype control) (eBioscience) was performed 6 days after the addition of ATRA.

Train_Line_175 Other randomized studies in PV have compared hydroxyurea against pipobroman (the first report showed a significant difference favoring pipobroman in the incidence of transformation into post-PV MF but no difference in survival, incidence of thrombosis, or the rate of leukemic conversion; however, a longer-term follow-up revealed a shorter survival, an increased risk of leukemic transformation, and a lower risk of post-PV MF, associated with pipobroman therapy), radiophosphorus alone or with HU (no difference in survival, incidence of thrombosis, or risk of transformation into post-PV MF but radiophosphorus alone was associated with significantly less incidences of both acute leukemia and other cancers), and radiophosphorus plus phlebotomy against phlebotomy plus highdose aspirin (900 mg/day) in combination with dipyridamole (225 mg/day) (the addition of antiplatelet agents provided no benefit in terms of thrombosis prevention but increased the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding).
Train_Line_176 The most common are point mutations in exons 13 and 14 (encoding the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain) resulting in amino acid substitutions V654A or T670I, respectively, which confer imatinib resistance by interfering with drug binding.
Train_Line_177 So far, no specific molecular marker has been identified in the remaining 30 to 45% of patients.
Train_Line_178 In fact, RARS is mainly characterized by erythroid dysplasia and ineffective erythropoiesis, and in most patients its clinical course is stable for years with a low risk of leukemic evolution.
Train_Line_179 The function of the SH2B3 PH domain is unknown.
Train_Line_180 Genome-wide gene expression data from 14 wild-type and nine DNMT3A mutated patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia were used to assess differential gene expression (for details of patients and array protocol, see Heuser et al).
Train_Line_181 Etiology of PV-associated pruritus remains to be determined and treatment responses to antihistamines have been both unpredictable and variable.
Train_Line_182 However, the effect of the absence of ASXL1 protein may have been masked by partially penetrant perinatal lethality.
Train_Line_183 Patients with TET2 mutations had slightly more early deaths that patients with mutations in DNMT3A alone, but both groups had comparable long-term survival rates (Fig 2C).

Train_Line_185 The relatively common occurrence of these mutations in two different prognostic spectrums of MDS, i.e. isolated 5q- and CK with -5/5q-, possibly implies two different mechanistic roles for TP53 protein.
Train_Line_186 Four mouse models with genetic deletion of Tet2 have shown that deletion of Tet2 results in progressive expansion of the hematopoietic stem progenitor compartment, increased hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal, and progressive development of a proliferative myeloid malignancy most similar to human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_187 Total RNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells and cell lines. cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng total RNA using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen).
Train_Line_188 ET and PV, disorders with a pure excess of mature blood cells, fit with this hypothesis, whereas PMF, which also has abnormal MK differentiation, is likely more complex.
Train_Line_189 Evidence is accumulating to indicate that in older patients age-dependent leukemia-specific differences also account for reduced treatment response.
Train_Line_190 DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_191 Within the IMF patients, there was no association between SOCS3 promoter methylation and patient's sex, age, hemoglobin level, white cell count, Lille prognostic score, platelet count, blast count, fibrosis grade, JAK2 V617F status or the presence of an abnormal karyotype.
Train_Line_192 Management of low-risk PV or ET patients with extreme thrombocytosis or abnormal bleeding diathesis.
Train_Line_193 Overall, 150 of 533 (28.1%) MDS patients had a somatic mutation of SF3B1, and the proportion of positive patients was significantly higher in the RARS and RCMD-RS subgroups than in the remaining WHO categories (72.0% vs 9.8%, P < .001).
Train_Line_194 Mutations involving SRSF2 are frequent in CMML (28-47%) and can also be seen in MDS (~12%), PMF(~17%), and therapy related/secondary AML (~7%).
Train_Line_195 There were no differences in the distribution of patients across the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification and the MDAPS risk categories.
Train_Line_196 There was no significant difference in the mRNA levels of TET1 (P = .82), TET2 var1 (P = .26), TET2 var2 (P = .44), or TET3 (P = .67) between TET2-mutant and nonmutant patients (Figure 4A).
Train_Line_197 This is particularly true in the case of GIST and CBF AML which are heterogeneous with respect to the presence and type of KIT mutations with different inhibitor sensitivity.
Train_Line_198 We hypothesized that activation of the JAK-STAT pathway might also occur as a consequence of activating mutations in certain hematopoietic-specific cytokine receptors, including the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), or the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR).
Train_Line_199 In one study, all of the IDH mutations identified in MDS patients were IDH1 mutation (3.6%).
Train_Line_200 The mutant gene had a positive predictive value for ring sideroblasts of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 93.5%-99.5%).
Train_Line_201 Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA by ranks showed no significant difference in SF3B1 mutant allele burden between these subgroups (P = .077).
Train_Line_202 Using unbiased sequencing approaches to identify molecular abnormalities in MDS, we probed the mutational status of a number of DNA repair genes.
Train_Line_203 This finding might constitute a possible therapeutic intervention for otherwise poor risk disease, but further studies are necessary to determine the predictive value of DDX41 mutations, deletions, or low expression for lenalidomide response.
Train_Line_204 A slightly higher incidence (12.6%) of WT1 mutations was reported by Gaidzik el al who analyzed all exons 1 to 10 but found the mutations were clustered in exons 7 and 9.
Train_Line_205 The reported incidence of IDH mutations in MDS varied from 3.5% to 12%.
Train_Line_206 A number of studies have linked ASXL1 mutations to the outcome of malignant myeloid diseases.
Train_Line_207 EZH proteins are methyltransferases involved in the di- and trimethylation of K27.
Train_Line_208 8 of 12 MDS patients with DNMT3A mutations received some treatment with the DNMT inhibitors, azacitidine or decitabine (Supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_209 Of 564 patients with MDS, 135 had refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia presenting as refractory anemia (RA), 107 had RARS, 102 had RCMD without ring sideroblasts, 54 had RCMD with ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS), 87 had RAEB-1, 57 had RAEB-2, and 22 had MDS del(5q).
Train_Line_210 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_211 Notably, SETD2 mutation is not unique to MLL-rearranged leukemia, as the SETD2-mutated patients also harbored a number of other known genetic aberrations, including AML1 (also called RUNX1)-ETO (also called RUNX1T1) or mutations in CEBPA or NPM1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 3-6).
Train_Line_212 It is not known whether ASXL1 has a similar function in mammals.
Train_Line_213 When evaluating thrombocytosis, the detection of JAK2V617F confirms the presence of an underlying MPN but its absence does not rule out the possibility since up to 40% of patients with ET might be JAK2V617F-negative.
Train_Line_214 We used these data to classify patients with intermediate-risk AML who had mutant FLT3-ITD into three categories.
Train_Line_215 Quantification of expression patterns of several surface and cytoplasmic antigens is necessary for lineage assignment, to diagnose mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and to detect aberrant immunophenotypes allowing for measurement of minimal residual disease (MRD).
Train_Line_216 CASITAS B-CELL LYMPHOMA.
Train_Line_217 Clinical and hematologic data were recorded after informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the analysis of the samples was approved by the institutional review boards of Paris Centre and Marseille.
Train_Line_218 The follow-up information was updated by means of clinic visits.
Train_Line_219 In cases with low blast percentages (5-10%), a repeat marrow should be performed to confirm relapse. Appearance of new dysplastic changes should be closely monitored for emerging relapse. In a patient who has been recently treated, dysplasia or a transient increase in blasts may reflect a chemotherapy effect and recovery of hematopoiesis. Cytogenetics should be tested to distinguish true relapse from therapy-related MDS/AML.
Train_Line_220 In the low/Int-1 subgroup of patients who were untreated (n = 162), there was no difference in OS between TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients (54.0 months; 95% CI: 40.1-68.5.0 vs 68.0 months; 95% CI: 16.6-119.4; P = .42).
Train_Line_221 We found no evidence of SETD2 gene deletion in our cohort of 241 patients with acute leukemia by Sequenom genotyping across chromosome 3 (Supplementary Fig. 10a).
Train_Line_222 Although replication of these findings will be required, our study demonstrates how mutations in TET2, DNMT3A, and TP53 identify a significant fraction of HSCT recipients with poor long-term survival, for whom alternatives to standard transplantation options should be considered.
Train_Line_223 These mice die at birth as a result of severe hypoglycemia, and they show disturbed hepatic tissue architecture with proliferative acinar formations resembling pseudoglandular hepatocellular carcinoma.
Train_Line_224 Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1, and details of their conditioning regimens are listed in the Data Supplement.
Train_Line_225 Consistent with the results of our overall analysis, the patients with non-CBF AML with mutated RAS treated with HDAC had the lowest CIR (Fig 1C).
Train_Line_226 The identification of patients with greater-than-predicted prognostic risk could influence the selection of therapy and improve the care of patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_227 The relative risk of death was found to be lower in the mutation-positive group than in the mutation-negative group.
Train_Line_228 In addition to increased proliferative capacity, we evaluated anti-differentiation and anti-apoptotic potential due to reduction of DDX41 function.
Train_Line_229 Consequently, deletion and mutations of this gene may be functionally equivalent.
Train_Line_230 The splicing of pre-mRNA, a highly regulated cascade of processes, is important for gene expression and genetic diversity; more than 90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing to make various protein isoforms for different biologic functions.
Train_Line_231 JAK2 V617F-positive PV patients showed higher levels than did JAK2 V617F-positive ET patients reflecting the increased V617F burden in PV compared to ET.
Train_Line_232 The SHP-2 protein has 3 functional domains: the PTPase catalytic domain and two SH2 domains (src homology 2), one in the C-terminal part (C-SH2) and the other in the N-terminal part (N-SH2) of the protein.
Train_Line_233 JMML has been observed rarely in Noonan syndrome, leading us to consider whether defects in PTPN11 were present in myeloid disorders.

Train_Line_236 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_237 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_238 The TET family consists of 3 proteins (TET1, TET2, and TET3) sharing 2 highly conserved domains.
Train_Line_239 The captured targets were subjected to sequencing using HiSequation 2000 with the pair-end 75-bp to 108-bp read option, according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_240 Maintenance therapy.
Train_Line_241 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_242 No CALR mutations were found in patients with polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm that is specifically associated with JAK2 mutations.
Train_Line_243 Similarly, in a study by the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA) group, priming with GM-CSF resulted in a higher CR rate and a better EFS, in particular in the intermediaterisk group, albeit without influencing OS.
Train_Line_244 We generated complementary DNAs (cDNAs) for the p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del mutant GATA2 proteins and the acquired CML blast crisis p.Leu359Val mutant.
Train_Line_245 Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper.
Train_Line_246 Concordant with the effect of ASXL1 on H3K27me3 levels, ASXL1 was found to physically associate with the core PRC2 complex members, and loss of ASXL1 diminished recruitment of PRC2 member PRC2 target loci, suggesting that ASXL1 may function in recruitment and/or stabilization of the PRC2 complex to specific loci in the mammalian genome.
Train_Line_247 In addition, BCOR-wt patients showed a BCOR expression level similar to non-MDS control (P < .001).
Train_Line_248 GO can produce remissions in 15% to 35% of older patients in first relapse.
Train_Line_249 Mutations were observed in all IPSS risk groups and WHO subtypes (Table 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Train_Line_250 He acquired RUNX1, ASXL1 and SETBP1 mutations when the disease progressed to RAEB 90 months later.
Train_Line_251 In 12 cases, where we had identified TET2 mutations in the total bone marrow cells, the mutation status was also assessed in paired bone marrow, CD34+, and CD3+ T cells, and in 8 of these cases, TET2 mutational status was also assessed in the skin biopsy.
Train_Line_252 It occurred concurrently with at least 1 additional mutation in 29 patients (85.3%) and was closely associated with RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations (P = .004, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively).
Train_Line_253 Treatment with busulfan or interferon-a is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures.
Train_Line_254 Germline and somatic DDX41 mutations were distinguished by analysis of buccal DNA in patients.
Train_Line_255 We, therefore, wanted to investigate the contribution, if any, of aberration(s) of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the pathogenesis of MPD.
Train_Line_256 All microarray data are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus public database less than accession number GSE2330.
Train_Line_257 Overview.
Train_Line_258 Thus, instead of being a single-hit disorder, MPN would result from the combination of several genetic events as exemplified by the finding of EZH2, TET2, and JAK2 mutations in the same MPN patient.
Train_Line_259 The mutation was closely associated with younger age, FAB M6 subtype, and t(7;11)(p15;15), but inversely related to M0 subtype.
Train_Line_260 TP53 alterations were associated with inferior survival; the 3-year estimated survival rates for CK+/TP53-altered and CK+/TP53-unaltered patients were as follows: EFS, 1% versus 13% (log-rank, P = .0007); RFS, 7% versus 30% (P = .01); and OS, 3% versus 28% (P < .0001), respectively (Table 1; Figure 3).
Train_Line_261 Following the guidelines approved by the local ethical committee, the files of the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany, and of the Bone Marrow Registry, University of Dusseldorf, Germany, were searched for bone marrow specimens that fulfilled the WHO criteria for RARS-T: a) evidence of >15% ringed sideroblasts (RS) on marrow smears, b) sustained high platelet counts without evidence of reactive thrombocytosis, and c) absence of defined cytogenetic abnormalities such as BCR-ABL, deletion 5q, inv(3) (q21q26) or t(3;3)(q21; q26).
Train_Line_262 Karyotypic risk categories based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system were; 11 (12%) high risk, 19 (21%) intermediate risk and 60 (63%) low risk.
Train_Line_263 In addition, there is no evidence from our study that cases with homo- or hemizygous TET2 mutations show reduced survival relative to heterozygous mutations, as might be expected if aberrant TET2 were driving the disease independently.
Train_Line_264 C/EBP proteins form a family of basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors that includes six members with related sequences and functions (alpha, beta, y, sigma, epsilon and Zeta).
Train_Line_265 All patients without U2AF1 mutation remained germline of the gene during clinical follow-ups while all U2AF1-mutated patients retained their original mutations unless they received intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_266 In the cohort of 353 AMLs from Italy, genomic DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and bidirectional direct Sanger sequencing of all BCOR coding exons (total of 21 amplicons) were done according to standard methods (Genewiz) using the primers listed in supplemental Table 10.
Train_Line_267 Correlation of TP53 alteration with pattern of chromosome abnormalities and CNAs.
Train_Line_268 Despite the prediction of a relatively benign clinical course, a subset of these patients with lower-risk MDS have more aggressive disease and shorter overall survival.
Train_Line_269 The spectrum of affected genes overlaps with those seen in AML and the closely related myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and myelodysplastic (MDS) syndromes.
Train_Line_270 Patients with CN-AML who harbored a mutation in DNMT3A were older, more frequently belonged to FAB groups M4 and M5, had higher WBC counts in peripheral blood at diagnosis, more often had mutated NPM1, more frequently had the NPM1/FLT3 low-risk mutation status, and had higher MLL5 gene expression levels as compared with DNMT3A wild-type CN-AML patients (Data Supplement Table S2).
Train_Line_271 Recommendations: In patients with PV or ET and extreme thrombocytosis, the use of aspirin can lead to bleeding complications because of AvWS; therefore, in the presence of platelets >1,000 x 109 /L, screening for ristocetin cofactor activity is advised and consideration be given to withhold aspirin therapy if the result shows <30% activity.
Train_Line_272 Results.
Train_Line_273 This high mutation rate suggests that DNMT3A mutations are among the most common molecular aberrations in CN-AML.
Train_Line_274 TABLE III. International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) Recommended Criteria for Post-Polycythemia Vera and Post-Essential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_275 The difference remained significant when the analysis was performed in the subgroup of patients with lower-risk MDS defined by the FAB classification (including RA and RA with ring sideroblasts), the WHO classification (other than RAEB, subtypes with blasts <5%), IPSS-R (including very low, low and intermediate groups) and those with favorable-risk cytogenetics (median, 36.1 vs 170.2 months, P<0.001, 36.1 vs 170.2 months, P<0.001, 33.8 vs 113.7 months, P<0.001 and 18.5 vs 69.3 months, P<0.001, respectively; Figure 2).
Train_Line_276 Such a finding raises the possibility of an integral link between 5q and TP53 mutations, building on a related suggestion that haploinsufficiency of RPS14 in 5q- patients is driving TP53 expression levels (Dutt et al 2011).
Train_Line_277 A third patient from whom sequential biopsies were available remained negative for the JAK2 mutation over a period of 3 years.
Train_Line_278 Pairwise comparisons were performed by Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and by 2-sided Fisher exact or X2 tests for categorical variables, and are provided for exploratory purposes.
Train_Line_279 Bone marrow aspirates or blood samples were collected from the eight index cases (families 1-4); an additional 840 patients with myeloid neoplasms seen at Cleveland Clinic, University of Muenster, and University of Chicago; and 197 cases from TCGA database (n = 1,045; Table S1).

(A) Overall survival (OS) in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) having wild-type (WT) or mutated DNMT3A.

(F) RFS in patients with CN-AML of the NPM1/FLT3 low-risk group according to DNMT3A mutation status.
Train_Line_281 Overall survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and groups were compared by the log-rank test.
Train_Line_282 This results in a functionally more relevant defect that may not be apparent when measuring VWF:Ag and FVIII levels alone and requires the use of assays that assess VWF function (e.g. ristocetin cofactor activity; VWF:RCoA).
Train_Line_283 The association of SRSF2 mutation with other gene mutations also was explored (Table 2).
Train_Line_284 Furthermore, novel therapies are now being developed that target some of the genetic lesions.
Train_Line_285 The earlier in gestation the diagnosis of leukemia, the higher the incidence of spontaneous abortion, prematurity, and low birthweight.
Train_Line_286 Recommendations.
Train_Line_287 The median International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score was 1 (range 0-3), and the median myeloblast count was 5 (range 0-28%).
Train_Line_288 This compound, which does not extend beyond the gatekeeper into the catalytic region (Figure 3) is a potent inhibitor of the T670I and V654A KIT mutants.
Train_Line_289 Although rare, dozens of families developing nonsyndromic forms of MDS and AML (that is, lacking other systemic manifestations) have been described.
Train_Line_290 Activation of Notch1 led to overexpression of Trib2, a protein which was found to decrease p42 C/EBPalpha protein-- possibly through enhanced proteasomal degradation - and to induce AML in mice.
Train_Line_291 Fourteen out of 19 (73%) patients with mutations who had BM trephine biopsies available for analysis showed strong TP53 expression with a Q score >6 (Supplementary Figure S1).
Train_Line_292 Three of the 16 patients with WT1 mutations at diagnosis lost the mutations at relapse, whereas 2 others acquired additional mutations.
Train_Line_293 Dose-intensive induction therapy was associated with a marked improvement in the rate of survival among patients who were positive for DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P = 0.001) (Fig. 4C) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A and NPM1 and no MLL translocations (P = 0.67) (Fig. 4D).
Train_Line_294 Detection of BCOR mRNA and protein.
Train_Line_295 ASXL1 has been reported to be involved in a large number of physical interactions where the biological and biochemical relevance of the majority of these interactions to hematopoiesis is unclear.
Train_Line_296 Statistical Analysis.
Train_Line_297 On multivariate analysis, age (> 50 years) was associated with a higher incidence of TET2 mutation (P=02).
Train_Line_298 A single patient (UPN4) showed both an acquired nonsense and a validated germline missense of BCOR (Table 3).
Train_Line_299 At a median follow-up of 8.4 years from diagnosis, only 1.3% of the patients developed AML.
Train_Line_300 Therefore, we tested the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations on patients with CN-AML in the molecularly defined NPM1/FLT3 mutation risk groups (high v low).
Train_Line_301 Multivariable analysis that included IDH1 and IDH2 mutations as separate categories, risk stratification by both WHO-defined histology and the IPSS-R prognostic scores, bone marrow karyotype and red-cell transfusion dependence identified presence of mutant IDH1 (P = 0.001), IPSS-R (P<0.0001) and transfusion need (P = 0.002) as independent predictors of inferior survival (Figures 1,2 and Table 3).
Train_Line_302 In addition to the changes in spliced isoform ratios, ZMYM2 mRNA was expressed at significantly lower levels in DDX41 low expressors (p < 0.001; Figure S7D).
Train_Line_303 Among the 53 AML patients with a previous history of MDS, four patients (7.5%) had IDH1 mutations in codon 132.
Train_Line_304 Fig 2. Distribution of mutations in 204 of 288 samples from patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes with one or more mutations. Each column represents an individual sample. Colored cells indicate a mutation in the gene(s) described in that row on the left. Darker bars indicate two or more distinct mutations. Tyrosine kinase (TK) pathway genes include NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, CBL, and JAK2.
Train_Line_305 Moreover, mutations in DNMT3A have been associated with adverse overall survival (OS) (Table 1 and reviewed recently by Thiede).
Train_Line_306 The mutation spectrum may imply the functional role of an affected gene acting as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in leukemia development.
Train_Line_307 Paternal cousins of the index case were also afflicted by AML at the ages of 79 and 89, but they declined genetic testing.
Train_Line_308 There are no randomized studies comparing standard AML therapy to other forms of treatment.
Train_Line_309 In another leukemia family (Figure S2A), a 73-year-old male patient (case 7) was diagnosed with secondary AML, whereas his nephew (case 8) presented with AML at the age of 56.
Train_Line_310 Patients with DNMT3A mutations had worse overall survival compared to patients without DNMT3A mutations (p=0.005) and more rapid progression to AML (p=0.007), suggesting that DNMT3A mutation status may have prognostic value in de novo MDS.
Train_Line_311 This report and the recent identification of mutations and deletions in histone modifying genes (UTX, ASXL1, TET2, EZH2) in MDS patients provides compelling evidence that epigenetic alterations contribute to MDS pathogenesis.
Train_Line_312 The slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Vector Laboratories, Inc).
Train_Line_313 Cytogenetics.
Train_Line_314 MPL mutations have been inconsistently associated with older age, female gender, lower hemoglobin level, and higher platelet count; no associations with survival or leukemic transformation have been reported.
Train_Line_315 Figure 1 Survival data for 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes stratified by IDH1 mutational status.
Train_Line_316 Both acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) genomes contain different global DNA methylation patterns compared to normal bone marrow cells and compared to each other, suggesting that there may be methylation-specific gene alterations that contribute to these diseases.
Train_Line_317 We identified distinct clinical phenotypes and molecular association patterns for each splice gene.
Train_Line_318 Targeted analysis in a larger patient population showed that RNA splicing mutations were frequent in patients with MDS and MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_319 1. The ancestral clone exhibits a mutation different from a coding sequence mutation on TET2 as exemplified by the EZH2 mutation preceding TET2 mutation.
Train_Line_320 When combined with a JMD (exon 11) mutation, the resultant double mutant also displays similar imatinib sensitivity to WT KIT, however substantially less than the JMD mutant alone (author's unpublished data).
Train_Line_321 This is primarily true for AML, although, as underlined by Walter et al, some genes are over-represented in MDS compared with AML and vice versa.
Train_Line_322 Accounting for both gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations, the overall frequency of genetic lesions range from 78% to 90%.
Train_Line_323 PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_324 Cytogenetic status, sex, WHO subtypes, transformation to AML, and IPSS score did not correlate with TET2 mutations.

Train_Line_326 This predisposition is different from the familial forms of MPN with a Mendelian transmission.
Train_Line_327 However, it is not known whether C/EBPalpha upregulation contributes to the favorable response of these patients to ATRA, as ATRA also greatly increases expression of C/EBPbeta which can itself induce maturation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells.
Train_Line_328 BCORL1 has been implicated in chromosomal rearrangements in hepatocellular carcinoma.
Train_Line_329 Genomic DNA from bone marrow samples was isolated using the Autopure extractor (QIAGEN/Gentra, Valencia, CA).
Train_Line_330 Three patients had 2 mutations that were associated with the same amplicon being sequenced (unique patient codes [UPCs] 55, 682G, and 2644).
Train_Line_331 According to the series studied, ASXL1 mutation frequency varies from a few percent to more than 50% of cases (Table 1).
Train_Line_332 The mutation that was identified was at position 515 in the MPL gene sequence, hence the name MPLW515L--the W and the L are the shorthand way of indicating exactly which change occurred.
Train_Line_333 Treatment details for both cohorts have been published earlier and are shown according to mutation status in supplemental Table 1 (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Train_Line_334 Aberrations >200 Kb with <50% overlap with copy number variations from the DGV and healthy individuals were considered as somatic aberrations and included in the analysis.
Train_Line_335 The functional relevance of some reported missense mutations is not clear.
Train_Line_336 Sensitization of leukemic cells with hematopoietic growth factors, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte macrophage (GM)-CSF, has been studied to increase cytotoxicity of chemotherapy.

Train_Line_338 All results were analyzed using a Student's t-test and are reported as mean += s.e.m., with significance of P < 0.05 indicated with an asterisk.
Train_Line_339 However, U2AF1 mutation was an independent poor-risk factor for OS, after adjustment for age and IPSS, using a multivariate Cox-regression analysis (Table III).
Train_Line_340 All mRNA-seq data are deposited at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database under accession code SRA123673.
Train_Line_341 This beneficial effect of cytarabine dose intensification, however, was restricted to patients with CBF AML and, to a lesser extent, to patients with CN-AML, whereas outcome of patients with other cytogenetic abnormalities was not affected by cytarabine dose.
Train_Line_342 Of the aforementioned 325 patients, 101 (31%) carried a mutation in SF3B1.
Train_Line_343 Studies investigating the function of this protein in hematopoietic malignancies as well as in lung and skin cancer have revealed numerous ways how tumor cells abrogate C/EBPalpha function.
Train_Line_344 Unlike the IPSS, the LR-PSS assigns a specific prognostic weight to the patient's age and stratifies patients into three risk categories instead of the two IPSS groups that define patients with lower risk.
Train_Line_345 We demonstrated that t(7;11)(p15;15), a translocation resulting in NUP98/HOXA9 fusion, was closely associated with the WT1 mutation.
Train_Line_346 On the other side, among the 110 patients who had no WT1 mutation at diagnosis, 3 acquired a novel WT1 mutation at relapse.
Train_Line_347 With a median follow-up time of 53 months (range, 1.0-160 months), patients with WT1 mutation had a significantly poorer OS and RFS than those without WT1 mutation (median, 14.0 months vs 29.5 months, P = .021; and 6 months vs 14 months, P < .001, respectively; supplemental Table 2; Figure 2).
Train_Line_348 Correlation with CNAs.
Train_Line_349 A higher proportion of non-CBF AML cases (~30% of all AML) display activating mutations in the closely related RTK, FLT3.
Train_Line_350 Primary analysis was performed on OS.
Train_Line_351 The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogenous group of diseases, characterized by cytopenia, but usually hypercellular bone marrow with dysplastic hematopoiesis, and a propensity to acute leukemia transformation.
Train_Line_352 In mouse models of AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia, overexpression of C/EBPalpha has resulted in abrogation of the leukemia and in increased survival of the animals.
Train_Line_353 Octa-Arginine mediated delivery of SH2B3 into megakaryocytic leukaemia cell lines was recently shown to be a non-toxic method to inhibit leukaemic cell proliferation (Looi et al 2011) and may serve as a model to develop SH2B3-based therapies in MPN.
Train_Line_354 Driver mutation: A mutation that causes a selective advantage in a cell with capacity for self-renewal, leading to formation of a clone of mutated cells.
Train_Line_355 In the second study, anagrelide was compared to hydroxyurea in WHO-classified ET in 259 high-risk ET patients; during the total observation time of 730 patient-years, there was no significant difference between the anagrelide and hydroxyurea group regarding incidences of major arterial (7 vs. 8) and venous (2 vs.6) thrombosis, severe bleeding events (5 vs. 2), minor arterial (24 vs. 20) and venous (3 vs. 3) thrombosis and minor bleeding events (18 vs. 15), or discontinuation rates (adverse events 12 vs. 15 or lack of response 5 vs. 2); incidences of leukemic or fibrotic transformations were not reported.
Train_Line_356 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_357 Among them, the disease of 368 patients fulfilled the criteria of MDS according to the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_358 Previous studies have shown a high incidence of TET2 mutations in CMML patients.
Train_Line_359 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_360 MPLS505N is both a germline (hereditary thrombocythemia) and somatic (ET) mutation.
Train_Line_361 The implications of SF3B1 mutations based on the findings of studies published so far are summarized in Table 3.
Train_Line_362 On the other hand, mutations in WT1 gene are found in approximately 10% of AML patients with hotspots in the 4 Cys-His zinc finger domains on exons 7 and 9.
Train_Line_363 The ASXL1 gene can be translocated and fused to the PAX5 gene in acute lymphoblastoid leukemia and altered by germ-line mutations in the Bohring-Opitz syndrome; this severe syndrome leads to death at an early age preventing to know whether susceptibility to hematopoietic diseases might result from ASXL1 germ-line mutations.
Train_Line_364 A tentative schematic representation of our current knowledge of these relationships is reported in Figure 3.
Train_Line_365 Recently, the mutation of lymphocyte adaptor protein (LNK or SH2B3) was detected in MPN.
Train_Line_366 Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: no (0 points); yes (2 points).
Train_Line_367 However, in contrast to JAK2V617F, exon 12 mutations are not associated with ET and PMF, although JAK2 exon 12 PV may progress to a secondary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_368 Analysis of TP53 mutation in sequential samples - effects of 5-azacitidine on mutant TP53 clones.
Train_Line_369 The coding exons of SF3B1 were screened using massively parallel pyrosequencing in patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolving from MDS.
Train_Line_370 (For details of patients and array protocol, see Heuser et al.)
Train_Line_371 Abnormal mRNA splicing may result from mutations of splice-site sequences, mutations in splicing regulatory sequences, and mutations in genes of the splicing machinery itself (ie, spliceosome mutations).
Train_Line_372 For example, the MAPK pathway is activated by WT KIT following SCF stimulation, and by mutant KIT in primary GISTs and cell lines, but not in AML cells or immortalised early myeloid cells expressing D816 mutant KIT where PI3K and/or STAT3 activation appear to be key effectors.
Train_Line_373 Figure 6. Deep Whole RNA-Seq Showed Splicing Defects in DDX41-Deficient Cells. (A) Increased exon skipping (top) and retention (bottom) in patients with DDX41 defects are indicated by an excess of green reads and red reads, respectively. The center panel shows a scatterplot of exon skipping in RNA isolated from control cells versus RNA from DDX41-defective mutant cells. Lines show the 10% difference cutoff limit used to select the most frequently affected exons. (B) Deep RNA sequencing was performed for blasts from patients with DDX41 mutations, deletions, and wild-type to analyze altered splicing. The bar diagrams indicate the top ten genes significantly more skipped in DDX41 defects (top) and in DDX41 WT (bottom). The arrow indicates the 13% difference of exon skipping in the ZMYM2 gene when comparing DDX41 defect and WT samples. (C) Exon 3 of ZMYM2 was skipped in DDX41-deficient cells as demonstrated by the read counts from deep sequencing. (D) RT-PCR was performed in K562 cells, CD34+ progenitors, and U937 cells to evaluate ZMYM2 exon 3 skipping compared with controls. Depicted is the skip:retain intensity ratio for WT and DDX41 knockdown/overexpressing samples. Each bar represents the mean += SEM of three independent experiments. See also Figure S7 and Table S6.
Train_Line_374 Mutation analyses of JAK2 and MPL were performed exclusively on patients with RARS-T.
Train_Line_375 Seventeen patients showed a mutant allele burden higher than 50%, but only in 6 cases this value was higher than 60%.
Train_Line_376 These data suggest that NPM1-mutated AML originates at or has characteristics of a more differentiated stage of hematopoiesis that is more susceptible to current treatment protocols than NPM1 wild-type patients.
Train_Line_377 We also performed JAK2 and MPL W515L/K mutation analyses to identify the relationship with the LNK mutation.
Train_Line_378 This has been attributed to the possibility that earlier studies unknowingly included patients with prefibrotic MF.
Train_Line_379 Here, we describe hypermethylation of the SOCS3 locus in a significant proportion of patients with IMF but not in patients with PV or ET.
Train_Line_380 Most of the patients received conservative and supportive care and only 91 (19.5%) patients received AML-directed chemotherapy, including 56 patients (12%) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_381 Besides, U2AF1 mutation was a poor prognostic factor for OS in the study of Markeshima et al (patient number, N = 310) but this finding was not confirmed in other studies (N = 150, 193, and 210, respectively).
Train_Line_382 Few deletions of the gene have been reported and ASXL1 is generally not included in the more telomeric 20q13 deletion that is often observed in myeloid diseases.
Train_Line_383 Although FLT3/ITD and CEBPA mutations were the most frequent gene alterations accompanied with WT1 mutation, there was no difference in the incidence of these 2 gene mutations between patients with and without WT1 mutation (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_384 Germline DDX41 frameshift mutations lead to a loss of function.
Train_Line_385 The long-term value of allogeneic HSCT after RIC regimens remains to be evaluated but current experience suggests a greater relapse incidence compared with transplants after high-dose preparative regimens.

Train_Line_387 Consequently, targeting of a single aberrant protein is unlikely to eradicate the leukemic clone.
Train_Line_388 Ideally, DNA and RNA should be extracted and viable cells stored; if cell numbers are limited, RNA extraction should be a priority, because RNA is suitable for molecular screening for fusion genes and leukemia-associated mutations.
Train_Line_389 The low number of BCORL1-mutated patients precludes any statistical analyses, but clinical follow-up was available for 3 MDS patients.
Train_Line_390 Mutations of the RNA splicing machinery are largely mutually exclusive and are most often founding events.
Train_Line_391 Patients.
Train_Line_392 In the current cohort, SRSF2 mutation was detected in 14.6% of patients.
Train_Line_393 Molecularly, our cohort was enriched in patients with mutations in SF3B1.
Train_Line_394 The presence of ASXL1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival for frameshift and point mutations combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.744; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024) and for frameshift mutations only (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008).
Train_Line_395 For the diagnosis of AML, the table provides a list of selected markers rather than a mandatory marker panel.
Train_Line_396 Two new provisional entities defined by the presence of gene mutations were added, "AML with mutated NPM1 [nucleophosmin (nucleolar phosphoprotein B23, numatrin)]," and "AML with mutated CEBPA [CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), alpha]."
Train_Line_397 Figure 2. MPLW515L-Expressing Cells Show Hyper-Responsiveness to TPO. (A) 32D MPLWT cells and 32D MPLW515L cells were cultured in triplicate at an initial concentration of 1 x 105 cells/mL, in RPMI/10% FBS containing TPO 2 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 0.01 ng/mL, 0.001 ng/mL, or in the absence of TPO for four days, and then cell numbers were assessed. Error bars denote the standard deviation for each sample measured in triplicate. (B) UT7 MPLWT cells and UT7 MPLW515L cells were cultured in triplicate, at an initial concentration of 1 x 105 cells/mL, in IMDM/10% FBS containing TPO 5 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 0.01 ng/mL, 0.001ng/mL, or in the absence of TPO for six days, and then cell numbers were assessed. Error bars denote the standard deviation for each sample measured in triplicate. (C) 32D MPLWT or 32D MPLW515L cells were deprived of cytokine overnight and then stimulated with TPO 5 ng/mL, 1 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL, 0.01 ng/mL, or without TPO for seven minutes and then analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, demonstrating increased JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation in response to TPO in 32D MPLW515L cells as compared with 32D-MPLWT cells. (D) Phosphorylation of JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, STAT5, AKT, and ERK in response to seven-minute stimulation with TPO (50ng/mL). 32D MPLWT or 32 MPLW515L cells were deprived of cytokine overnight and then stimulated with TPO 50 ng/mL for seven minutes and then analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylation of JAK2, TYK2, STAT3, STAT5, AKT, and ERK, demonstrating increased phosphorylation of these proteins in response to TPO in 32D MPLW515L cells as compared with 32D MPLWT cells.

Train_Line_398 The current concept of the disease considers gene mutations, deregulated gene expression, and epigenetic changes as key steps in the pathogenesis of the disease.
Train_Line_399 IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive.
Train_Line_400 This category may be useful in the clinical development of novel agents within phase 1 clinical trials, in which a transient morphologic leukemia-free state may be achieved at the time of early response assessment.
Train_Line_401 The resultant DNA-PK complex activates DNA-PK's kinase activity which phosphorylates H2AX to form yH2AX.
Train_Line_402 This disruptive mutation pattern is similar to that of BCOR germline mutations causing the OFCD syndrome.
Train_Line_403 Further, WT1 mutations were distinctly associated with poor prognosis in AML patients.
Train_Line_404 After 27 months of follow-up, the incidences of thrombotic complications were 3.6% for hydroxyurea and 24% for no hydroxyurea, although the "thrombotic" episodes in two patients in the non-hydroxyurea arm constituted superficial thrombophlebitis.
Train_Line_405 Moreover, in hibition of the calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma results in reduced levels of phosphorylated Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5.
Train_Line_406 Similar to prior reports, P95H was the most frequent mutation.
Train_Line_407 Subsequently, Bejar et al used next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based genotyping to screen mutational hotspots in 111 genes in 439 patients with MDS.
Train_Line_408 The expression level of target genes was normalized to the GAPDH mRNA.
Train_Line_409 PV diagnosis requires meeting either both major criteria and one minor criterion or the first major criterion and two minor criteria. ET diagnosis requires meeting all four major criteria. PMF diagnosis requires meeting all three major criteria and two minor criteria.
Train_Line_410 This and other ongoing studies have been recently reviewed.
Train_Line_411 Primary analysis was performed on OS and time to AML progression.
Train_Line_412 For detection of SRSF2 and U2AF35 mutations, we applied standard PCR techniques and bidirectional sequencing.
Train_Line_413 Mutation analyses.
Train_Line_414 In our study, seven of the nine IDH-mutated patients retained the same mutation during sequential follow-ups and the other two lost IDH mutations in remission status after chemotherapy.
Train_Line_415 This has been attributed to the possibility that earlier studies unknowingly included patients with prefibrotic MF.
Train_Line_416 Expression Analysis of ASXL1 mRNA.
Train_Line_417 The long latency is also supported by the finding of the germline mutation in adult carrier family members who did not so far develop leukemia.
Train_Line_418 It is unclear whether point mutations in ASXL1 play a similar role as frameshift mutations. Chou et al considered frameshift mutations as true mutations in AML and excluded point mutations that were located outside the PHD domain.
Train_Line_419 In the last 2 years, studies of whole exome or whole genome sequencing led to the discovery of mutations in the RNA splicing machinery, of SETBP1 mutations in aCML, and of CSF3R mutations in CNL.
Train_Line_420 ASXL1 mutations are usually heterozygous, suggesting that haplo-insufficiency is the key pathological factor; however, the truncated ASXL1 protein could also have a dominant negative role in titrating out an interacting protein.
Train_Line_421 JAK2 AND MPL MUTATION ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_422 The histogram of mutant allele burden was compatible with a bimodal distribution that resulted from a mixture of 2 normal distributions with different variance and means.
Train_Line_423 The cells were then stained with rabbit alpha-GATA2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) (1:1000) for 1 h followed by Alexa 594-conjugated goat rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) (2 mug/ml) for 20 min.
Train_Line_424 11.3 Demethylating agents.
Train_Line_425 In one report, the ASXL1 mutation detected in one patient with RAEB2 at diagnosis was retained at the time of AML transformation.
Train_Line_426 Sequential analysis of WT1 mutation during the clinical course was performed in 309 samples from 133 patients.
Train_Line_427 Somatic mutations in the corresponding ZF2 of the related protein family member GATA3 are found in breast cancer8 (Fig. 1c).
Train_Line_428 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_429 This finding is in sharp contrast to the frequent (>80%) large deletions in SETD2 in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) detected by the same genomic analysis (Supplementary Fig. 12) and by SNP array data (Fig. 2b).
Train_Line_430 All statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters obtained at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic, which in most instances coincided with time of BM biopsy at the Mayo Clinic and study sample collection.
Train_Line_431 Accurate determination of prognosis is critical for selection of appropriate therapy in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Train_Line_432 Figure 2. Subcellular localization and DNA binding properties of wild-type and mutant GATA2. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with empty vector (EV) (pCMV-XL6 empty vector), wild-type (WT), p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or p.Leu359Val and harvested them after 24 h. (a) Protein blot analysis of GATA2 expression in nuclear lysates. We prepared the nuclear lysates and performed protein blots probing for GATA2. (b) We stained the cells for GATA2 (pink) and DAPI (blue). Scale bars, 10 mum. (c) Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) of wild-type and mutant GATA2. We prepared the nuclear lysates and bound them to the TCRsigma enhancer (which contains the GATA binding site) oligonucleotide in the absence or presence of 200-fold unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide (D, human TCRsigma enhancer; C, GATA consensus; G, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promoter). We visualized the probes using chemiluminescence (top). GATA2 & NS corresponds to a band that contains both GATA2 and a non-specific protein. To visualize GATA2 alone, we performed an EMSA-protein blot probing with polyclonal alpha-GATA2 antibody (bottom), which shows the level of binding of wild-type and mutant GATA2. A neutralizing alpha-GATA2 antibody in the far right lane removed GATA2 but not the non-specific binding protein (top), and the specificity of GATA2 is confirmed below.
Train_Line_433 Univariate analysis of SF3B1 mutation status showed a significant effect on OS (HR = 0.28, 95% CI, 0.09-0.94, P = .039) but no effect on LFS (HR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.1-3.78, P = .6) in this subgroup.
Train_Line_434 Approximately 66% of all mapped reads mapped to an exon target += 100 bases, documenting the successful technical outcome of this experiment.
Train_Line_435 Evaluation of the JAK2V617F burden at different hematopoietic differentiation steps in humans has shown that the clonal expansion occurs mainly in late differentiation steps in PV and ET.
Train_Line_436 Survival analysis.
Train_Line_437 In the normal course of events ligand binding triggers receptor dimerisation, relief of auto-inhibitory interactions and trans-phosphorylation within dimer pairs followed by recruitment, phosphorylation and activation of downstream signalling proteins.
Train_Line_438 The diagnosis of post-PV or post-ET MF should adhere to criteria recently published by the International Working Group for MPN Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) (Table III).
Train_Line_439 The pathogenesis of MDS has not been clearly identified; genomic damage with accumulation of genetic aberrations, deregulated or autoreactive immune responses, and abnormal bone marrow microenvironment might all contribute to the development and progression of this preleukemic disease.
Train_Line_440 Progression to AML was defined according to the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_441 3. More surprisingly, it was initially reported that approximately 50% of acute leukemia developing on a JAK2V617F MPNs was JAK2 wild type, even in the absence of previous chemotherapy.
Train_Line_442 We investigated the prevalence of mutations in PTPN11 in leukemic cells from five unrelated children with Noonan syndrome and JMML.
Train_Line_443 Furthermore, two patients who were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation had in-frame germline mutations (type G1 and G2) (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_444 This is in accord with the concept that the target must be a "driver" of the cancer (e.g., as evidenced by mutation or over-expression) to be a useful therapeutic target.
Train_Line_445 TP53 mutations were present only in 5/26(19%) patients with isolated 5q-, in comparison to 21/29 (72%) with CK with 5q abnormalities (P < 0.001) (Fig 1A).
Train_Line_446 Notably, the only group in which more than 50% of patients remained in remission was that with mutated RAS treated with HDAC.
Train_Line_447 Posttranslational Modification.
Train_Line_448 All nine (100%) patients with IDH mutations and LT had died.
Train_Line_449 Most frequent high-level DNA amplifications mapped to 21q22, 11q13~25 (n = 22 each; 9%), and 8q24 (n = 8; 4%).

Niemeyer; Wolf-Karsten Hofmann; Brigitte Schlegelberger; Arnold Ganser; Michael Heuser.
Train_Line_451 The studies published so far on the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in MDS have provided conflicting results, as detailed in Table 2.
Train_Line_452 With a median follow-up of 12.9 years (range, 4.3 to 18.8 years), the estimated 10-year CIR for patients with RAS mutations was 65% (95% CI, 48% to 82%) compared with 73% (95% CI, 66% to 88%) for those with wild-type RAS (P = .31; Table 1).
Train_Line_453 Favorable outcome has also been reported in single arm studies using oral busulfan.
Train_Line_454 Eleven patients had exon 6 mutations, including Q157P in seven patients and Q157R in four.
Train_Line_455 Human wild-type ASXL1 associates with the calypso ortholog BAP1.
Train_Line_456 Clonal expansion of T cells has been well documented in some patients with MDS, and it will be interesting to additionally investigate a potential association of ASXL1 mutations and immune-mediated bone marrow failure.
Train_Line_457 Written, institutional review board-approved, protocol-specific informed consent was obtained when each patient entered the study.
Train_Line_458 From a theoretical point of view, they disrupt several processes downstream, because an altered spliceosome may cause abnormal transcription and altered splicing outcomes of thousands of genes.
Train_Line_459 Moreover, sequential analyses showed all ASXL1-mutated patients retained the original ASXL1 mutation during disease progression, but frequently acquired other novel genetic alterations, including RUNX1, NRAS, KRAS, SF3B1 and SETBP1 mutations and chromosomal evolution, at the same time.
Train_Line_460 Other studies have confirmed the low incidence of AML in PV patients treated with hydroxyurea (1-5.6%).
Train_Line_461 Double CEBPA mutations (CEBPA double-mutation) instead of all CEBPA mutations were used as a variable for survival analysis in this study because recent studies showed that only CEBPA double-mutation, but not single mutation, were associated with favorable prognosis.
Train_Line_462 Analysis of sequencing reads and further genotyping using Sequenom assay showed an approximate 50% allele frequency for each of the two mutations (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that these mutations are present in almost all of the leukemic cells.
Train_Line_463 In U2AF1, the most commonly affected codon was Q157 resulting in a glutamine to proline substitution in 9 patients.
Train_Line_464 Thus, the picture of TP53 mutations in post-MPN-AMLs suggests that they play a prominent role in the transformation process.
Train_Line_465 METHODS.
Train_Line_466 These results are in agreement with previous reports on the detection of methylation of the exon 2 region in normal individuals.
Train_Line_467 Assessment of global DNA methylation levels did not reveal differential methylation of ASXL1 mutation versus wild type (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_468 We did not observe any association between ZRSR2 and other mutations, which may be because of the low number of ZRSR2-mutated patients in our cohort.
Train_Line_469 Genetic significance of BRCC3 mutations.
Train_Line_470 Three representative cases are shown in Figure S3.
Train_Line_471 All amplicons were generated using AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 2 mM MgCl2 and the following cycle strategy: 95 --degrees--C, 10 min; 95 --degrees--C, 30 s; 66-58 --degrees--C, 20 s (touchdown, 0.8 --degrees--C per cycle for 10 cycles); 72 --degrees--C, 45 s (total of 40 cycles); and 72 --degrees--C, 3 min.
Train_Line_472 Karyotypic risk categories in this group of SF3B1-mutated patients, based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system were; 1 (8%) high risk, 5 (38%) intermediate risk, and 7 (54%) low risk.
Train_Line_473 JAK2 V617F allele burden was determined by real-time PCR using MGB-hydrolysis probes (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_474 The MPL gene is known to be part of a pathway of genes that control how certain blood cells develop.
Train_Line_475 Together, this suggests that point mutations and small indels in the GATA2 coding sequence are not frequent in sporadic AML.
Train_Line_476 Other variables predicting for inferior OS in univariable analysis were age (P < .0001), cytogenetic MK (P = .03), and genomic losses of 5q (P = .03), 7q (P = .003), 16q (P = .0004), and gains of 1p (P = .04), and amp(11)(q13~25; P = .05).
Train_Line_477 The range of allelic ratios in all JAK2V617F positive patients was 4 to 35%T suggesting heterozygosity, while the range in our patients was compatible with the presence of a homozygous JAK2V617F mutation in six patients (21.4%).
Train_Line_478 We assessed the impact of cytarabine dose on cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of patients with (mutRAS) and without (wild-type; wtRAS) RAS mutations.
Train_Line_479 Genomic DNA from patients, normal individuals and methylated control samples [5 peripheral blood DNA samples that had been methylated using CpG methylase (New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK)] were modified with sodium bisulphite and the CpG island regions were amplified by PCR as previously described.
Train_Line_480 A total of 67 patients had nonmutated JAK2 and MPL as well as nonmutated CALR exon 9.
Train_Line_481 However, when we considered both the RAS status and consolidation therapy, our analysis revealed for the first time that the impact of RAS mutations on the risk of relapse in adult AML depends on the type of postremission chemotherapy.
Train_Line_482 This finding suggests that the important issue is not the order of appearance of the mutations but the fact that they all occur in a HSC with the MPN phenotype being mainly driven by the JAK2V617F mutation.
Train_Line_483 To date, the presence of molecular genetic abnormalities has not been routinely included in the evaluation of patients before transplantation.
Train_Line_484 The median follow-up time for survival in the 155 CK-AML was 36.6 months (95% CI, 29.9-51.4 months); the estimated 3-year event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort were 5% (95% CI, 2%-10%), 17% (95% CI, 9%-31%), and 12% (95% CI, 7%-19%), respectively.
Train_Line_485 THE ROLE OF C/EBPalpha IN AIRWAY EPITHELIAL DIFFERENTIATION AND LUNG CANCER.
Train_Line_486 The chromosomal region including C/EBPalpha was found deleted in 50% of non-small-cell lung cancers suggestive of the presence of a tumor suppressor at this locus.
Train_Line_487 Simultaneously, other splicing genes such as U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1, synonym U2AF35), serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 35 kDa subunit-related protein 2 (ZRSR2) involved in the spliceosome pathway have also been reported to be frequently mutated in MDS.
Train_Line_488 Several factors may explain the poor outcome, such as persistence of the primary malignant disease, injury to organs from prior therapy, depletion of normal hematopoietic stem cells, damage to marrow stroma (in particular by radiation therapy), chronic immunosuppression or dysfunctional phagocytes leading to colonization with pathogenic or antibioticresistant bacteria and fungi, and refractoriness to transfusion support.
Train_Line_489 Of the 21 patients with TP53 mutations analysed by SNP-A, 10 had an aberrant chromosome 17 with the smallest region affecting 17p13.3-p13.1 (6.9 Mb) in UPN28, associated with a large clonal TP53 mutation (Figure S1).
Train_Line_490 Definitions for basic terms used in studies of the genetic basis of myeloid neoplasms are reported in the Appendix.
Train_Line_491 BRCC3 is a member of the JAMM/MPN+ family of zinc metalloproteases capable of cleaving Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains, and is implicated in DNA repair.
Train_Line_492 Because most BCOR mutations are predicted to trigger nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, we used quantitative RT-PCR to quantify BCOR mRNA levels in 5 patients harboring frame-shift mutations that introduced premature stop codons (before the second last exon) in comparison with 14 patients devoid of BCOR mutations.
Train_Line_493 First, CALR mutations are exclusively seen in patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis without JAK2 or MPL mutations and are never observed in patients with polycythemia vera or in patients with JAK2 or MPL mutations.
Train_Line_494 The Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to evaluate time to survival and time to progression.
Train_Line_495 The purity of each sorted fraction was superior to 95%.
Train_Line_496 No recurrent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in more than two patients.
Train_Line_497 Many efforts have been made to improve the prognostication in MDS by modifying the old scoring system or developing new ones.
Train_Line_498 Myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF) is one of a group of chronic blood disorders, known as chronic myeloproliferative disorders.
Train_Line_499 BaF3-E cells overexpressing either WT or mutant SH2B3 were serum-starved for 6 h, stimulated with Epo and studied for changes of STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation using phospho-flow (Fig 2).
Train_Line_500 Table 1. List of candidate somatic mutations identified in the AML index patient.
Train_Line_501 For example, in a study of lower-risk patients with MDS, DNMT3A mutations were not associated with OS in univariable analysis.
Train_Line_502 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_503 Pruritus occurs in the majority of patients with PV (and a substantial number with PMF) and is often exacerbated by hot bath.
Train_Line_504 In addition to genetic mutations, we detected downregulated mRNA expression of SETD2 in patients with lymphoma and a subset of patients with leukemia at an ~9.0% frequency using expression data deposited in the Oncomine data set 17 (Supplementary Fig. 10b,c).
Train_Line_505 Significantly, 86% (18/22) of CK patients with TP53 mutation had either LOH at 17p or double mutations, suggesting complete loss of wild type TP53 allele and protein.
Train_Line_506 Screening for RAS mutations was performed initially using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and a slot blot technique, and subsequently a denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography method and polymerase chain reaction enrichment assay based on PNA-mediated clamping.
Train_Line_507 RESULTS.
Train_Line_508 Table 3. Cox regression analysis for the overall survival in MDS patients.
Train_Line_509 Genomic DNA libraries were generated from peripheral-blood granulocyte DNA (tumor samples) and matched CD3+ T-lymphocyte DNA (control samples) with the use of the NEBNext DNA Sample Prep Reagent set (New England BioLabs).
Train_Line_510 Single-cell suspensions of spleen and bone marrow were prepared by pressing tissue through a cell strainer, followed by red blood cell lysis.
Train_Line_511 NOTE. Cox proportional hazard regression models were constructed for individual mutation status and adjusted for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS; Model I) and Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System (LR-PSS; Model II) risk classifications. The 15 mutations with a frequency >= 1% were evaluated along with age (< 60 v >= 60 years), sex, and either IPSS or LR-PSS (excluding age) as candidates in stepwise Cox regression modeling. Patient sex was not a statistically significant variable in either model.
Train_Line_512 Consequently, allogeneic HSCT has been widely used for these patients.
Train_Line_513 Older age per se, however, should not be a reason to withhold intensive therapy.
Train_Line_514 Variables considered for model inclusion were IPSS risk group, transfusion dependence, age (below vs above median), and mutation status of all 18 analyzed genes (mutated vs wild-type).
Train_Line_515 A transcriptional profiling study performed using these models identified the forkhead family member and differentiation gene, FoxA2, as directly regulated and induced by C/EBPalpha in lung cancer cells.
Train_Line_516 Despite the decreased cellularity of the marrow in the KI mice, there was an expansion in the most primitive stem/progenitor compartment in these mice due to an expansion of the multipotent progenitor population specifically.
Train_Line_517 Thus, a secondary AML developing from MDS is not monoclonal in the strict sense but is instead a mosaic of several clones/genomes with different sets of somatic mutations, illustrating the concept of intraclonal or intratumoral heterogeneity.
Train_Line_518 Correlation of TP53 alterations with MK.
Train_Line_519 In its inactive form, the PTPase catalytic domain is masked by N-SH2; binding of phospho-tyrosyl peptides on N-SH2 induces a conformational change uncovering the catalytic site.
Train_Line_520 Gleixner and co-workers recently reported that KIT-independent activation of SFKs, Btk and Lyn, synergises with D816V KIT in HMC-1 leukaemic mast cells.
Train_Line_521 In a randomized trial, low-dose cytarabine (LDAC; 20 mg twice daily s.c. for 10 days) was associated with longer survival than hydroxyurea (sufficient dose to keep WBC < 10 x 109/L) and thus might be considered for such patients, but the magnitude of benefit is not so great as to make hydroxyurea or supportive care an unreasonable option.
Train_Line_522 In multivariate analysis using covariables including age >=50 years, IPSS-R and mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, IDH, SRSF2 and DNMT3A (Table 4), ASXL1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for OS.
Train_Line_523 To determine the estimated cell frequency, the mutated read count was multiplied by 2 according to the 2 gene copies per cell expected for normal karyotype.
Train_Line_524 In essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, CALR mutations and JAK2 and MPL mutations were mutually exclusive.
Train_Line_525 Whole-exome sequencing was performed in six patients with primary myelofibrosis who did not have mutations in JAK2 or MPL.
Train_Line_526 5.2 AML-related factors.
Train_Line_527 Genomic DNA was amplified using a whole-genome amplification kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany).
Train_Line_528 The multivariate Cox regression analysis also showed the same result (supplemental Table 3).
Train_Line_529 These results provide genetic evidence for the tumor suppressive role of C/EBPalpha in skin carcinogenesis.
Train_Line_530 Isolated BCOR or BCORL1 mutations were detected in only 3 patients.
Train_Line_531 A genotype fingerprint of 22 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each sample was generated by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight genotyping (Sequenom, San Diego, CA).
Train_Line_532 First, U2AF1 mutation rate was low in MDS patients, so a large cohort might be needed to demonstrate a significant survival difference.
Train_Line_533 Except for one patient with del5q (UPN1), all patients with mutations and non-complex karyotype had normal 17p status by SNPA karyotyping, and harboured a single TP53 mutant clone with an allele burden <37%.
Train_Line_534 It is thought that PRC2 contributes to chromatin structure regulation.
Train_Line_535 To fit the definition of a blast phase-transforming event, the candidate event had to be detected in all blast cells but not in the majority of cells from the preceding MPN clone.
Train_Line_536 The Ba/F3 cells expressing the 52-bp deletion showed cytokine-independent proliferation.
Train_Line_537 DDX41 knockdown in K562 cells slightly impaired apigetrin-induced erythroid differentiation (Figures 4H, 4I, S5E, and S5F).
Train_Line_538 Despite better characterization of the genetic background of MPN, the contribution of specific somatic genetic events to transformation to AML has not been well understood.
Train_Line_539 At the time of diagnosis, the majority of patients with MDS (approximately 70%) have lower-risk disease as defined by the low and intermediate-1 risk groups of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).
Train_Line_540 We tested 84 patients: 38 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 18 RAEB, 4 RAEB in transformation, 4 AML with monosomy 7, 12 AML post-myelodysplastic syndrome and, as a control, 8 non-syndromic JMML.
Train_Line_541 Figure 1. Nucleotide variations found in our study. Arrows in each DNA sequence trace are indicating the substituted position. Three variations are new mutations composed of two missense mutations (p.R551W and p.I568T) and one nonsense mutation (p.Q423X). The others (p.P242S, p.W262R and p.A536T) are known SNPs.
Train_Line_542 In that study, SF3B1 mutations had a trend toward longer survival and patients with concomitant DNMT3A and SF3B1 mutations had a longer median survival than patients with DNMT3A mutations alone.
Train_Line_543 The earliest and most studied of such genes is MLL1, which is affected by translocations as well as in-frame duplications in AML.
Train_Line_544 Identification of Myeloid Leukemias with Mutant Familial DDX41 Mutations.
Train_Line_545 C/EBPalpha is required for granulocytic differentiation, and restoration of its proper function holds the promise of enabling leukemic stem and progenitor cells from patients with AML and CML myeloid blast crisis to overcome the block of differentiation and undergo maturation into functional effector cells.
Train_Line_546 Almost half of investigated patients presented a mutation in SF3B1 (16.4%), SRSF2 (11.1%), ZRSR2 (11.1%), or U2AF35 (5.4%).
Train_Line_547 Pairwise comparisons were performed by Mann-Whitney test or t test for continuous variables and by two-sided X2 tests for categoric variables and are provided for exploratory purposes.
Train_Line_548 In a recent study of patients older than 60 years of age receiving induction therapy (idarubicin 12 mg/m2 for 3 days, cytarabine 1.5 g/m2 for 3 days), scoring of baseline comorbidities using the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCTCI) was predictive of early death rates and overall survival (OS).
Train_Line_549 Downregulation of hnRNP-E2 by the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib restored both C/EBPalpha protein expression and granulocytic differentiation of the blasts.
Train_Line_550 In this regard, it makes more sense to pursue a more specific JAK2 inhibitor, such as SAR302503, rather than a less specific JAK1/2 inhibitor, such as ruxolitinib or CYT387.
Train_Line_551 Our final goal was to identify CN-AML-associated somatic mutations in protein-coding genes and to assess their recurrence in a cohort of 553 AML patients to improve our knowledge of this poorly characterized subgroup.
Train_Line_552 Note: DNA samples were not available for analysis of SF3B1 and U2AF35 mutations in two patients.
Train_Line_553 Recently, Sasaki et al have reported the phenotype of a conditional Idh1(R132H) knock-in (KI) mouse model.
Train_Line_554 Therapy was administered with 2 induction cycles of ICE (idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide), followed by 2 consolidation cycles with high-dose cytarabine.
Train_Line_555 When point and frameshift mutations combined were considered, patients with ASXL1 mutations had significantly lower expression of ASXL1 (P = .025); conversely, point mutations alone, compared with wild-type ASXL1, were not significantly associated with lower ASXL1 expression levels (P = .124; Table 1).
Train_Line_556 Figure 5. Impact of BCOR mutations on survival. Data are shown for overall survival (n = 26 vs n = 396; alive at 2 years, 25.6% vs 56.7%; P = .032; A) and event-free survival (n = 26 vs n = 396; event-free survival at 2 years, 7.5% vs 41.4%; P = .015; B).
Train_Line_557 Mutations in histone modifying genes have been described in MPNs, particularly in the polycomb group proteins (PcG), EZH2, and the polycomb repressive ubiquitinase component, ASXL1.
Train_Line_558 The results of sequential analysis of 142 patients without IDH mutation at diagnosis were not shown.

Train_Line_562 The somatic origin could be verified for 2 truncating BCORL1 mutations.
Train_Line_563 Somatic alterations were identified in 97.3% of the patients.
Train_Line_564 The inhibitory effect on growth was partially lost with SH2B3 EQ and GV PH domain mutants.
Train_Line_565 Target regions of 40 genes (Data Supplement) and genotype fingerprint regions were enriched using the HaloPlex polymerase chain reaction or Custom SureSelect hybrid capture system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to manufacturer instructions.
Train_Line_566 Of these, FLT3 mutation analysis was performed on 1,232 (58%) MDS and 302 (65%) CMML patients.
Train_Line_567 We observed heterozygosity with respect to a mutation in exon 3 of PTPN11, predicted to alter the N-terminal src-homology-2 (N-SH2) domain, in all cases (Table 1).
Train_Line_568 We, therefore, measured SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels within granulocytes of normal individuals, IE patients and MPD patients (20 with PV, 48 with ET, 30 with IMF, 5 with post-PV MF and 5 with post-ET MF) (Figure 3).
Train_Line_569 Fig 3. IL3-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation is inhibited less by the Sh2b3 PH domain mutants compared to WT Sh2b3. Murine 5FU-enriched BM progenitor cells transduced with either WT or mutant Sh2b3 were serum-starved for 2 h and stimulated with 10 iu/ml IL3 for 15 and 60 min. Phosphorylation of STAT5 and ERK was assessed in GFP-positive cells by flow analysis, using PE-conjugated STAT5 (pY694) and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated ERK 1/2 (pY202/204) antibodies. A representative of 2 independent experiments is shown. (A) Gating of GFP-positive cells. (B) STAT5 phosphorylation. MFIs for each time point were normalized to unstimulated cells and are represented as fold-change.
Train_Line_570 PROGNOSTIC IMPACT OF ASXL1 MUTATIONS AND ASXL1 EXPRESSION LEVELS.
Train_Line_571 Duration of remission prior to relapse: > 18 months (0 points); 7 to 18 months (3 points); and 6 months or less (5 points).
Train_Line_572 Recommendations: I recommend the use low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day; range 40-100 mg/day) in all patients with low-risk PV or ET, provided there are no major contraindications.

Setd2 knockdown or scrambled shRNA-transduced MLL-NRIP3 HSPCs were transplanted into recipient mice. For secondary and tertiary BMT, an equal number of Setd2 knockdown or scrambled shRNA-transduced leukemia cells were transplanted to sublethally irradiated recipient mice. Survival curves of the leukemic mice and the associated P values are shown. (b) Hepatosplenomegaly in Setd2 knockdown MLL-NRIP3 leukemic mice.

(c) Setd2 knockdown accelerates Mll-Af9 leukemia in serial BMT assays. Setd2 knockdown or scrambled shRNA-transduced Mll-Af9 knock-in HSPCs were transplanted into recipient mice. For secondary and tertiary BMT, an equal number of Setd2 knockdown or scrambled shRNA-transduced leukemia cells were transplanted to sublethally irradiated recipient mice. Survival curves of leukemic mice and the associated P values are shown. (d) Limiting dilution assay. An equal number of Setd2 knockdown or scrambled shRNA-transduced Mll-Af9 knock-in leukemia cells isolated from secondary leukemias in cell dosage (as indicated in Supplementary Table 9) were transplanted to sublethally irradiated recipient mice. Leukemia-initiating cell frequencies and the P value calculated by L-calc software are shown. (e) GSEA plot showing increased gene expression of human leukemia stem cell and cancer-related embryonic stem cell (ESC) signatures, as well as Wnt signaling, in MLL-NRIP3 leukemia cells with Setd2 knockdown relative to scrambled shRNA controls. The normalized enrichment score (NES) and P values are shown.
Train_Line_575 Given that MPN is a disease of myeloid progenitors and WT JAK2 is also a mediator of IL3 signalling, we studied IL3 signalling in progenitor-enriched BM cells with forced expression of either WT SH2B3 or one of the SH2B3 mutants (Fig 3).
Train_Line_576 TP53 gene encodes p53, a major tumor suppressor protein involved in various biologic activities, including the control of cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis.
Train_Line_577 Background.
Train_Line_578 However, a significant proportion of patients with ET or MF are JAK2V617F-negative.
Train_Line_579 For example, beta-thalassemia may derive from mutations in splice-site sequences of the HBB gene that cause abnormal splicing of HBB and defective synthesis of its protein, beta-globin.
Train_Line_580 SOCS3 transcript levels were highest in patients with polycythemia vera and other JAK2 V617F positive myeloproliferative disorders, consistent with SOCS3 being a target gene of JAK2/STAT5 signaling.
Train_Line_581 The median follow up of this cohort of these 51 patients was 31 months (95% CI 24-39 months) and their WHO category included 7 with 5q-syndrome;7 refractory anaemia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD); 27 refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) types 1/2; 3 secondary AML (sAML); 6 therapy-related MDS (tMDS) and 1 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML).
Train_Line_582 Other studies have confirmed the low incidence of AML in PV patients treated with hydroxyurea (1-5.6%).
Train_Line_583 Patients with SRSF2 mutation had an inferior overall survival (P = .010), especially in the lower risk patients.
Train_Line_584 No specific comorbidity index has yet been developed for older patients with AML; thus, only organ dysfunctions are currently taken into account.
Train_Line_585 Event-free survival end-points, measured from the date of first sample collection, were progression to AML or death (failure), and alive without progression of disease to AML at time of last follow-up (censored).
Train_Line_586 The limiting dilution analysis of the transplanted mice showed a significantly higher frequency of leukemia-initiating cells or leukemia stem cells (LSCs) after Setd2 knockdown (1/142 as compared to 1/2765, P = 0.001, Fig. 5d), thereby providing direct evidence for increased self-renewal of LSCs through loss of function of Setd2.
Train_Line_587 TP53 losses or mutations entail various tumor phenotypes, and mouse models investigating TP53 inactivation identified gain of function for hot spot mutations, such as R175H, R248W, and R273H, as well as increased proliferation related to accelerated tumorigenesis and leukemogenesis, resulting in a more aggressive AML.
Train_Line_588 The percentages of chromosomes carrying the G>T transversion representing the JAK2V617F allele (%T) were determined using a standard curve method and the formula: %T=(height of G-peak)x100.
Train_Line_589 There are multiple sites of KIT mutation in cancers, with some "hot-spots" corresponding to the intracellular and extracellular juxtamembrane domains (exons 8, 9 and 11) and the activation loop of the kinase domain (exon 17) which lead to disruption of auto-inhibitory mechanisms.
Train_Line_590 The prognostic significance of some recently described mutations, such as TET2 (Smith et al 2010), EZH2 (Ernst et al 2010), SF3B1 (Malcovati et al 2011), IDH1/IDH2 (Patnaik et al 2012) and DNMT3A (Walter et al 2011), in MDS remains unclear, but mutations of TP53 have been consistently associated with complex karyotype (CK) with -7/7q- and -5/5q-, and predicts poor outcome (Bejar et al 2011).
Train_Line_591 The murine bone marrow transplant assay was performed as previously described.
Train_Line_592 The finding that IDH mutation predicts poorer OS in patients with lower-risk MDS in this study implies IDH mutation can be used as a surrogate biomarker to risk-stratify this group of patients for early treatment intervention.
Train_Line_593 Ayalew Tefferi.
Train_Line_594 Mutation analysis of IDH in MDS patients is useful for risk and treatment stratification, especially in the lower-risk group.
Train_Line_595 The criterion of CRi is of value in protocols using intensified induction or double induction strategies, in which hematologic recovery is not awaited, but intensive therapy will be continued. In such protocols, CR may even not be achieved in the course of the entire treatment plan. In these instances, the overall remission rate should include CR and CRi patients. Some patients may not achieve complete hematologic recovery upon longer observation times.
Train_Line_596 Additional passengers mutations can be captured during subclonal evolution.
Train_Line_597 The clinical and hematologic characteristics of patients with and without mutations are compared in Table 3.
Train_Line_598 The first normal distribution accounted for 22% of observations with a mean value for mutant allele burden equal to 15%, whereas the second distribution accounted for 78% of observations with a mean value of 41%.
Train_Line_599 HiDAC, if not used for first induction, with or without an anthracycline may be considered for salvage therapy before allogeneic HSCT.
Train_Line_600 Older patients from a clinical practice perspective may be divided according to whether they are 60 to 74, or 75 years of age or older.
Train_Line_601 Of note, ASXL1 mutation has been recently incorporated into a prognostic scoring system for CMML as a negative prognostic factor.
Train_Line_602 However, BCOR mutations in AML were of somatic origin, as confirmed by their absence in the germline DNA of all 7 AML patients studied at the time of complete remission (including 1 patient with a consensus splice-site mutation), and in line with the observation that the OFCD syndrome was not apparent in any of our 14 female AML patients.
Train_Line_603 Indeed, we found that DNMT3A mutational status had a significant effect on the outcome with dose-intensive chemotherapy (Fig. 4B) (P = 0.02).
Train_Line_604 Since this first description of IDH1 mutations in AML several reports have confirmed that IDH1 mutations occur in patients with cytogenetically normal AML with a frequency of 5.5-11%.
Train_Line_605 Hence, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del perturb the transactivation ability of GATA2, presumably by disrupting association with PU.1 or other interacting transcription factors, and are likely affect expression of downstream targets.
Train_Line_606 Cytogenetic and molecular analysis.
Train_Line_607 Five microliters of each PCR product were amplified in a 25 muL reaction containing 1X SYBR Green mix (Stratagene), 0.6 muM of each primer and 0.03 muM ROX reference dye (Stratagene).
Train_Line_608 RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR.
Train_Line_609 This suggests that BRCC3 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in MDS.
Train_Line_610 Imatinib in treatment of SM and AML.
Train_Line_611 In summary, the current study demonstrates that patients with primary AML harboring RAS mutations treated with HDAC as postremission therapy are significantly less likely to experience relapse than patients treated with LDAC.
Train_Line_612 Biochemistry: glucose, sodium, potassium, calcium, creatinine, aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, urea, total protein, uric acid, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). Coagulation tests: prothrombin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR) where indicated, activated partial thrombo-plastin time (aPTT). Urine analysis: pH, glucose, erythrocytes, leukocytes, protein, nitrite.
Train_Line_613 Most response criteria and survival measures as described in the previous recommendations have been widely used by clinicians and cooperative groups (for definitions see Tables 5 and 6).
Train_Line_614 All 23 WT1-mutated patients studied lost their WT1 mutations at remission status, suggesting that these mutations were somatically acquired in the leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_615 Based on the above, the use of aspirin in both PV and ET requires caution, especially in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 109 /L), which promotes the development of AvWS.
Train_Line_616 Western Blot Analysis.
Train_Line_617 CNAs and copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity UPD.
Train_Line_618 The corresponding mutational frequencies in CMML1/CMML-2 were 40/37, 5/9, and 10/3%.
Train_Line_619 Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and time to AML transformation. (A-B) The DNMT3A/SF3B1 mutation status. (C-D) The SRSF2/TET2 mutation status. (E-F) The ZRSR2/TET2 mutation status in 198 MDS patients (log-rank test).
Train_Line_620 IDH mutations were closely associated with older age (median, 74 years vs. 65 years, P = 0.015), higher platelet count at diagnosis (median, 132 x 103/muL vs. 74 x 103/muL, P = 0.008) and FAB subtype RAEBT (36.4% vs. 10.5%, P < 0.001) and CMML (27.3% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.014).
Train_Line_621 In a retrospective study, aspirin use has also been reported to be beneficial in JAK2V617F-positive low-risk ET, in preventing venous thrombosis, and also in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, in preventing arterial thrombosis.
Train_Line_622 However, when we regarded these three variations as new mutations based on the study using 50 normal controls, the prevalence of LNK mutation in our study could be estimated as 7.1% in chronic-phase MPN.
Train_Line_623 Mutations in ASXL2 and ASXL3 have not been found in myeloid diseases so far, but ASXL2-MYST3 and EPC1-ASXL2 fusions have been identified in myelodysplastic syndrome and T-cell acute leukemia, respectively.
Train_Line_624 Patients with >= 5% blasts had significantly worse OS compared with those with < 5% (HR, 1.84; P = .032), as did patients with a complex karyotype compared with those without (HR, 2.16; P = .007).
Train_Line_625 Whole-genome sequencing has become a useful tool for finding new mutations.
Train_Line_626 3 modalities are considered that have reached phase 3 clinical trial
Train_Line_627 These data indicate that constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling by the mutant JAK2V617F kinase plays a central role in the pathogenesis of JAK2V617F-positive PV, ET, and MF.
Train_Line_628 In one of these index cases, deep sequencing at two time points (Case #1 in Table 1) indicated that the BRCC3 mutation was present at RCMD diagnosis as well as throughout RAEB evolution (20 months later) (Figure 2A).
Train_Line_629 Previous studies have highlighted the clinical and biologic heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_630 A prominent finding in our study was the infrequency of low-abundance TET2 mutant clones.
Train_Line_631 Immunophenotype analysis.
Train_Line_632 Array CGH (n = 131) using the 2.8k platform and/or the 8.0k platform and unpaired SNP analyses using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Array (n = 61) were performed as previously described; Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 profiling (n = 42) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocols (Affymetrix).
Train_Line_633 There was no difference in CD4/CD8+ or c-Kit positive cell populations between MPLW515L and MPLWT bone marrow and spleen cells (unpublished data).
Train_Line_634 Reasonable precautions should be undertaken to protect patients from bacteria or fungi in their environment.
Train_Line_635 NOTE. Hazard ratios greater than or less than 1 indicate an increased or decreased risk, respectively, of an event for the first category listed.
Train_Line_636 DNMT3A mutations have recently been reported in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), providing a rationale for examining the status of DNMT3A in MDS samples.
Train_Line_637 It has proved successful in treating many cases of GIST following relapse on imatinib and has received FDA approval for use in this context.
Train_Line_638 Progression to AML was defined according to the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_639 The JAK2V617F positive patients had significantly higher red blood cell counts (p=0.009), lower mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (p=0.002) and higher leukocyte count (p=0.011; Table 2).
Train_Line_640 Among the 54 CMML patients, 3 BCOR nonsense and 1 frameshift mutations were identified (4/54 = 7.4%; 95% CI, 2.9-17.6; Table 3 and Figure 1).
Train_Line_641 Our data support the concept that RARS-T shares several of the distinct pathophysiological features common to classic Philadelphia-chromosome negative MPD including striking megakaryocytic proliferation, overproduction of platelets, vascular events, and abnormalities of chromosomes 8 and 20 and MF.
Train_Line_642 This approach could be used to identify an additional subgroup of patients who would have a mutationally defined favorable outcome with induction and consolidation therapy alone and a subgroup of patients with mutationally defined unfavorable risk who would potentially be candidates for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation or participation in a clinical trial, given the prediction of a poor outcome with standard AML therapy (Fig. 5A).
Train_Line_643 Barcoded samples were pooled in equimolar amounts and subjected to 100-nucleotide paired-end sequencing on an Illumina Hi Seq 2000 (San Diego, CA).
Train_Line_644 This region undergoes a major conformational shift on kinase activation (Figure 2).
Train_Line_645 To approach the primary imatinib resistance of D816 mutant KIT that commonly occurs in SM and also in AML, melanoma and germ cell tumours, newer drugs have been evaluated.
Train_Line_646 Induction therapy.
Train_Line_647 About 85% to 90% of unfractionated bone marrow cells were found to be clonal in these patients, both in the MDS and in AML phase, irrespective of the number of blasts.
Train_Line_648 Therefore, allogeneic HSCT should be performed within clinical trials.
Train_Line_649 Overall survival (OS) end points, measured from the date of first sample collection, were death (ie, failure) and alive at last follow-up (ie, censored).
Train_Line_650 ISM is a chronic disease which is treated for symptomatic relief, whereas ASM is a debilitating and incurable disease with shortened life expectancy and is a candidate for therapy with KIT inhibitors.
Train_Line_651 Delivery while patient and fetus may be cytopenic should be avoided.
Train_Line_652 In a recent study, mutations in 5 genes (TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1) were found to be independently associated with decreased OS in MDS.
Train_Line_653 It is known that DNMTs interact with EZH2, allowing the coupling between PRC2 and DNA methylation.
Train_Line_654 Expression of TET1, TET2, and TET3 was analyzed in a subset of 116 patients [RCMD = 48, RAEB-II = 26, RAEB-I = 13, AML with MDS-related changes (sAML) = 12, MDS/MPN-U = 8, CMML-I = 3, CMML-II = 3, and RCMD with ringed sideroblasts (RS) = 3], of which 18 had TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_655 The patient was diagnosed with AML with maturation according to WHO 2008 criteria.
Train_Line_656 The results of the current study support a different role for the various SH2B3 domains.
Train_Line_657 In a first model of Asxl1 gene knock-out in the mouse ASXL1 loss mildly perturbed myelopoiesis but did not trigger an actual hematological malignancy.
Train_Line_658 More specifically, somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in 75% of patient with ring sideroblasts, whereas mutations of U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SRSF2 were more common in myeloid disorders without ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_659 Somatic mutations in other genes, such as TET2, CBL, EZH2, DNMT3A, and ASXL1, are present in a proportion of cases of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but these can co-occur with JAK2 and MPL mutations and are found in all types of myeloid cancers.
Train_Line_660 Mutations of the splice-site sequences or splicing regulatory sequences are responsible for a large fraction of human inherited diseases.
Train_Line_661 In summary, ASXL1 mutations were detected in a substantial portion of MDS patients and were closely associated with trisomy 8 and mutations of RUNX1, EZH2, IDH, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1 and SRSF2.
Train_Line_662 In 3 families, subjects carrying the GATA2 (C1061T) mutation had macrocytic anemia and developed MDS/AML between the second and fifth decade of life.
Train_Line_663 The patients comprised 27 males and 15 females with average ages of 63 and 64 years, respectively.
Train_Line_664 Mutations in codon 140 or 172 of IDH2 were not identified in any of the 193 MDS patients. Only one NPM1 mutation was found in a MDS patient with wild-type IDH1 and IDH2.
Train_Line_665 Mann-Whitney test method was used to compare continuous variables and medians of distributions.
Train_Line_666 The function of the resulting modified nucleotide, hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is not clear yet, but it appears to be present in all cell types.
Train_Line_667 This finding is compatible with the presence of cells heterozygous for the JAK2V617F mutation, but since we analyzed a mixture of cells, we cannot exclude the presence of a small population of cells that were already homozygous for JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_668 PV diagnosis requires meeting either both major criteria and one minor criterion or the first major criterion and two minor criteria. ET diagnosis requires meeting all four major criteria. PMF diagnosis requires meeting all three major criteria and two minor criteria.
Train_Line_669 ASXL1 mutations are all disclosed in exon 12 of the gene and are believed to lead to the truncation of the plant homeodomain at the C-terminus of the protein, which is involved in chromatin modification.
Train_Line_670 This valine is located at one of the predicted interfaces between JH1 and JH2 domains, and the change to a phenylalanine appears to relieve the inhibition of the JH2 domain on the kinase domain.
Train_Line_671 However, two other studies demonstrated IDH1 mutation was an independent predictor of inferior survival, while another two showed no prognostic impact of IDH mutations.
Train_Line_672 A subsequent multivariate analysis according to FLT3-ITD status showed that in patients with wild-type FLT3-ITD, mutations in TET2, ASXL1, PHF6, and MLL-PTD were independently associated with an adverse outcome.
Train_Line_673 Mapping results and detected variants were exported to R/Bioconductor for further analysis.
Train_Line_674 Since KIT expression is down-regulated during normal myelopoiesis, any disease resulting from activating mutation of KIT might be self-limiting in the absence of a differentiation block.
Train_Line_675 In addition to low-dose aspirin (and phlebotomy to a hematocrit target of 45% in case of PV), high-risk patients with PV or ET should receive hydroxyurea in order to minimize their risk of thrombosis (starting dose 500 mg BID).
Train_Line_676 Initially, it was suggested that TET1 was involved in the self-renewal of ES cells by controlling Nanog, but recent evidence suggests that both TET1 and TET2 are necessary for pluripotency by controlling cell fate through the regulation of distinct sets of genes.
Train_Line_677 Time to AML progression was measured from date of first sample collection to the time of AML diagnosis.
Train_Line_678 In our study, ASXL1-mutated MDS patients had poorer OS and higher rates of AML progression, especially in lower-risk patients, but not in the higher-risk ones.
Train_Line_679 According to Vogelstein et al, most human cancers are caused by 2 to 8 sequential genetic lesions that develop over the course of 20 to 30 years.
Train_Line_680 The median age of the cohort was 71 years (range, 20-90 years), with 67% of the patients being males.
Train_Line_681 The Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to plot survival curves, and log-rank tests were used to calculate the difference of OS between groups.
Train_Line_682 Seven patients (88%) with IDH1 mutations, including all six IDH1 R132S mutants had a normal karyotype.
Train_Line_683 Furthermore, the quantitative nature of the sequencing data allowed us to confirm cellular mixes, comprising clones with LOH and ones without.
Train_Line_684 This model revealed as significant factors TP53-altered (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-1.00; P = .05) and age (OR for a 10-year difference, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.87; P = .003).
Train_Line_685 At presentation, most MDS patients have 2 or 3 oncogenic driver mutations and hundreds of background or passenger mutations.
Train_Line_686 * Drug resistance also arises due to secondary KIT mutations resulting in relapse.
Train_Line_687 Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include history of thrombosis, leukocytosis, and advanced age.
Train_Line_688 Analysis of B cells demonstrated a proportionate decrease in B220 positive cells in MPLW515L bone marrow and spleen (unpublished data).
Train_Line_689 Fig 2. Forest plots summarizing the multivariable models for cumulative incidence of relapse of (A) all 185 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and (B) 150 patients with non- core binding factor AML. The hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for each variable in the model are shown. HRs less than 1 indicate lower risk for relapse for the first category listed. mutRAS, mutated RAS; wtRAS, wild-type RAS; HDAC, high-dose cytarabine; LDAC, low-dose cytarabine.
Train_Line_690 Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out on a StepOne Plus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) by using the ASXL1 gene expression assay (Applied Biosystems; Assay ID ASXL1: Hs00392415_m1).
Train_Line_691 Any discussion of choice of therapy must refer to observations that 74% of older patients estimated that their chances of cure with "3 + 7" were 50% or more; in contrast, 85% of their physicians estimated this chance to be less than 10%.
Train_Line_692 Comparison of the distribution of categorical variables in different groups was performed with either the Fisher exact test (when computationally feasible) or the X2 test (larger tables).
Train_Line_693 Out of these genes affected in myeloid neoplasms, frequently deleted UIMC1 showed haploinsufficient expression (P<0.05) (Online Supplementary Figure S7).
Train_Line_694 In a study of MPNs, with the exception of a single patient who acquired both ASXL1 and TET2 mutations, all patients with ASXL1 mutation at leukemic transformation already had ASXL1 mutation at the chronic stage.
Train_Line_695 We sequentially studied 119 samples from 51 patients at different time points for the emergence of TP53 clones in 16% of patients, whilst the rest did not have sequential samples available for analysis.
Train_Line_696 The mutations were confirmed at least twice.
Train_Line_697 For flow cytometry, cells were washed in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin and stained with monoclonal antibodies in PBS + 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 minutes on ice.
Train_Line_698 WT SH2B3 and all the PH domain mutants interacted with 14-3-3 to a similar extent.
Train_Line_699 Some mutations in the different SOCS have been found in MPNs, but they seem rare.
Train_Line_700 This box summarises key points contained in the article.
Train_Line_701 BCOR mRNA levels were quantified in duplicate wells by real-time PCR using the TaqMan Gene Expression assays; Hs00372378_m1* for BCOR and Hs99999907_m1 for B2M (housekeeping gene) in an AB7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_702 Hydroxyurea was better in terms of reducing the risk of arterial thrombosis, major bleeding, and fibrotic progression.
Train_Line_703 Indeed, within these risk groups, patients carrying an SF3B1 mutation showed significantly better OS and EFS compared with those without mutation (P = .038 and P = .026; Figure 4).
Train_Line_704 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Allogeneic HSCT as a postremission strategy is associated with the lowest rates of relapse.
Train_Line_705 Furthermore, it acted synergistically with imatinib or sunitinib.
Train_Line_706 RESULTS.
Train_Line_707 A significant proportion of del(5q) cases include the DDX41 locus, which leads to haploinsufficiency in a sizable proportion of patients with myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_708 To further test this hypothesis, the time-to-AML-transformation was analyzed in low and intermediate-1 IPSS risk patients of the current cohort.
Train_Line_709 MPLS505N is both a germline (hereditary thrombocythemia) and somatic (ET) mutation.
Train_Line_710 In one of these studies involving 163 patients, the drug was effective in more than 90% of the patients and median survival exceeded 17 years.
Train_Line_711 Immunoprecipitation products were extracted from protein G beads using Laemmli sample buffer.
Train_Line_712 BCOR is also affected by acquired mutations or translocations in retinoblastoma and sarcoma.
Train_Line_713 For example, small deletions outside of the coding sequence or deletion of a single exon would have been missed by the current analyses.
Train_Line_714 The inferior survival of the JAK2 mutation-negative patients may be due to the predominance of dysplastic features reflected by lower erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, higher MCV and even multilineage dysplasia of the bone marrow in a subset of patients.
Train_Line_715 There was no correlation of ASXL1 mutation with other gene mutations studied (Table 2).
Train_Line_716 Late obstetric complications as well as maternal thrombohemorrhagic events are relatively infrequent and platelet count usually decreases substantially during the second and third trimesters.
Train_Line_717 The panel considers a marrow trephine biopsy optional, but it should be performed in patients with a dry tap (punctio sicca).
Train_Line_718 Therefore, druginduced reduction in JAK2V617F allele burden might not necessarily translate into long-term benefit in ET or PV.
Train_Line_719 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_720 One of these, BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex 3 (BRCC3), is a member of the JAMM/MPN+ family of zinc metalloproteases capable of cleaving Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains.
Train_Line_721 Among the three patients with IDH1 mutation, two had R132C mutation and the remaining one had R132H mutation.
Train_Line_722 Mutation status of ASXL1 in patients with MDS.
Train_Line_723 All three disorders are characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation but their disease-causing mutations remain unidentified despite a plethora of mutations described beginning in 2005.
Train_Line_724 Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly decreased the risk of death and the risk of infection-related death.
Train_Line_725 Mutations in DNMT3A independently predicted a shorter overall survival (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.21; P = .005) by multivariate analysis, but were not associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) or complete remission (CR) rate when the entire patient cohort was considered.
Train_Line_726 "Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms" has remained a distinct entity; however, since most patients have received treatment using both alkylating agents and drugs that target topoisomerase II for prior malignancy, a division according to the type of previous therapy is often not feasible.
Train_Line_727 GATA2 is indispensable for hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_728 A minimum of 10 wild-type clones per patient were considered to exclude a mutation.
Train_Line_729 While this biochemical activity has been demonstrated in cell-free biochemical assays, the in vivo relevance of this interaction and regulation of H2AK119Ub levels is less clear, possibly related to redundancy in ASXL proteins and their interaction with BAP1.
Train_Line_730 CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CALR MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_731 These data suggest a control of the mutated transcript by the nonsense-mediated decay system.
Train_Line_732 A trend was observed for RUNX1 mutations to be enriched in patients concomitantly mutated for SRSF2 (16% vs 6%; P = .09).
Train_Line_733 Conclusions.
Train_Line_734 Study patients and samples.
Train_Line_735 Table 4. Causes of Death and Cumulative Incidence of Relapse or NRM.
Train_Line_736 In general, CK-AMLs are characterized by chromosomal gains and losses, rather than balanced translocations, suggesting distinct mechanisms in leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_737 Nearly one half of patients (46%) carried a mutation in TP53, DNMT3A, or TET2 and accounted for 64% of deaths.
Train_Line_738 Our univariate analysis confirms the importance in 4 out of 5 prognostically relevant genes reported in MDS.
Train_Line_739 While investigating the coding genome of fludarabine-refractory CLL, Rossi et al found recurrent mutations of SF3B1, and therefore did targeted resequencing of the gene in 3 different patient cohorts.
Train_Line_740 The functions of the other ASXL proteins are poorly defined.
Train_Line_741 Although previous reports suggest that the R882 mutation has loss of function properties, the R882 mutant was not tested in the presence of the wild-type allele, which may alter the mutant phenotype.
Train_Line_742 None of these mutant forms display the enhanced imatinib sensitivity of exon 11 mutant KIT, however the N822K mutant and those involving D419 have similar sensitivity to WT KIT, suggesting that detection of CBF AML patients with these mutations may select a subgroup of patients likely to respond.
Train_Line_743 The prevalence of LNK mutations is not high in human MPN, especially among patients with chronic-phase MPN (<10% mutated).
Train_Line_744 U937 was transfected in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene for 24 hr, and then selected with blasticidin (5 mg/ml).
Train_Line_745 In GIST cell lines apoptosis could be induced with antagonists to the upregulated BCL2 antiapoptotic protein, while reversing down-regulation of pro-apoptotic BIM could bring about cell death.
Train_Line_746 The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), c-KIT, and other type III RTKs, PDGF receptor (PDGFR), Colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (c-FMS) and FLT3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3) play important roles in cancer.
Train_Line_747 The mutations in all SRSF2-mutated patients were heterozygous.
Train_Line_748 Impact of IDH mutations on clinical outcome.
Train_Line_749 They looked at DNA from white blood cells, and also from normal cheek cells for comparison.
Train_Line_750 In addition to the predisposition for somatic DDX41 mutations, germline DDX41 mutations were associated with several other somatic mutations; among the 62 most frequently mutated genes, DDX41 lesions coincided with TP53, RUNX1, and LUC7L2 mutations (Figure S4).
Train_Line_751 Although in a few AML patients we observed missense BCOR variants, we decided not to discuss them in this paper as they often turned out to be germline polymorphisms when non-leukemic DNA was available for analysis.
Train_Line_752 Primer sequences are available upon request.
Train_Line_753 The difference in survival was attributed to an increased incidence of AML in patients treated with chlorambucil or radiophosphorus compared to those treated with phlebotomy alone (13.2% vs. 9.6% vs.1.5% over a period of 13-19 years).
Train_Line_754 Research done over the past several years clearly points out the critical tissue- and cell-specific function of C/EBPalpha at the crossroads of cell proliferation and differentiation control.
Train_Line_755 PROGNOSTIC IMPACT OF DNMT3A MUTATIONS IN PATIENTS WITH AML IN CYTOGENETIC SUBGROUPS.
Train_Line_756 Iron stains may allow for the detection of iron stores, normal sideroblasts, and ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_757 A number of transcription factors such as thyroid transcription factor-1, FoxA2, and C/EBPalpha control the intricate process of lung development and airway epithelial differentiation.
Train_Line_758 Table 2. Expression of cell-surface and cytoplasmic markers for the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia and mixed phenotype acute leukemia.
Train_Line_759 In the first controlled study in PV, the PV study group (PVSG) randomized 431 patients, between 1967 and 1974, for treatment with either phlebotomy alone or phlebotomy with either oral chlorambucil or intravenous radioactive phosphorus (P32).
Train_Line_760 From the crystal structure of autoinhibited KIT, it is apparent that the side chain of residue K642 forms an H-bond with the backbone of T574 which stabilises the autoinhibited structure.
Train_Line_761 Features of the AML index patient subjected to WES.
Train_Line_762 Thus, 28 (1.9%) of our 1444 patients with various myeloid neoplasms exhibited BRCC3 mutations.
Train_Line_763 The relatively common occurrence of these mutations in two different ends of the spectrum of MDS, isolated 5q- and complex cytogenetics with 5q aberrations, possibly implies two different pathogenetic roles for TP53 protein in disease biogenesis and evolution.
Train_Line_764 Mutations of EZH2, RUNX1, TP53, and ASXL1 were associated with shorter overall survival independent of the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_765 Recently, a new cytogenetic category has been proposed that distinguishes AML of particularly unfavorable risk, that is, the monosomal karyotype.
Train_Line_766 Colonies were scored by morphology, and representative colonies were confirmed by Wright-Giemsa stained slides of colony cytospins.
Train_Line_767 SF3B1 mutants were also detected at a lower frequency in a variety of other tumor types.
Train_Line_768 All microarray data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE30442.
Train_Line_769 HR > 1 indicates an increased risk of an event for the first category listed.
Train_Line_770 Although progress has been made in defining prognostic markers for AML, a substantial percentage of patients lack a specific abnormality of prognostic significance.
Train_Line_771 A 6-bp insertion starting at amino acid residue R446, resulting in the duplication of the amino acids arginine and serine, was observed in 9 patients (9 of 221, 4.1%).
Train_Line_772 This phosphatase is a key regulator of multiple KIT signalling pathways.
Train_Line_773 All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 18 software (SPSS).
Train_Line_774 Variables considered for model inclusion were IPSS, transfusion dependence, ferritin level (above or below 1000 mug/L), age (below vs above median), SF3B1 mutation status, ASXL1 mutation status, RUNX1 mutation status, IDH1 mutation status, TP53 mutation status, DNMT3A and NRAS mutation status, and SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutation status.
Train_Line_775 Western blotting of native protein in primary extract as well as immunoprecipitates obtained with anti-DDX41 confirmed the findings of the mass spectrometry experiments (Figure S6C).
Train_Line_776 We have previously identified a common region of UPD on chromosome 4q24 in MDS (8%) using 250-K SNP arrays that were subsequently shown to harbor TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_777 Conclusion.
Train_Line_778 Thus, in this study we investigated the frequency and prognostic influence of DNMT3A mutations in the context of other prognostic markers in a cohort of 489 uniformly treated patients with AML.
Train_Line_779 Three mutations in codon R140 of IDH2 and one mutation in codon R172 were found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (7.5%).
Train_Line_780 Various germ-line mutations of GATA2 have been detected in patients with the Emberger syndrome, characterized by primary lymphedema associated with a predisposition to AML.
Train_Line_781 FLT3 mutation status was determined in DNA from initial bone marrow aspirate samples.
Train_Line_782 Methylation of H3K36 and H3K79 are the two major histone modifications that are involved in transcriptional elongation.
Train_Line_783 One family presented with MDS and lymphedema, resembling symptoms of Emberger syndrome, and we have evidence of GATA2 function in lymphatic vessels (J. Kazenwadel, G.A. Secker, C.N. Hahn, H.S. Scott & N.L. Harvey, unpublished data).
Train_Line_784 When considering the Italian and German series together, DNMT3A mutations were detected in 10 of 23 (43.5%) BCOR-mutated patients as opposed to 24 of 172 (13.9%) BCOR-unmutated patients, a statistically significant difference (P = .001 by Fisher exact test; Table 3 block C).
Train_Line_785 Fig 1. Schematic hierarchical representation of TP53 mutations in patients with chromosome 5 aberrations either isolated 5q- or part of a complex karyotype (A) and in patients with poor risk International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetics (B).
Train_Line_786 Figure 1. Frequency of CALR Mutations in Myeloid Neoplasms. Panel A shows the distribution of JAK2, MPL, and CALR mutations in the three classical entities of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Panel B shows the frequency of CALR mutations in various myeloid cancers. The total numbers of patients included in the analysis for a specific disease entity are shown. Panel C shows the distribution of mutations in JAK2, MPL, CALR, and SF3B1 among 24 patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T). AML denotes acute myeloid leukemia, CML chronic myeloid leukemia, CMML chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and MDS myelodysplastic syndrome.
Train_Line_787 In recent years, molecular cytogenetic and array-based techniques have enabled a more precise characterization of these complex genetic changes.
Train_Line_788 Autologous HSCT is considered an alternative option for postremission therapy in patients with favorable- and intermediate-risk cytogenetics, whereas it cannot be recommended in patients with high-risk cytogenetics.
Train_Line_789 Fig 1. SH2B3 PH domain mutants compared to WT SH2B3 have a decreased inhibitory effect on BaF3-E and BM colonies. (A,B) BaF3-E cells were transfected with either Sh2b3 wild type (WT) or mutant Sh2b3. GFP-positive cells were sorted 2 d after transfection and plated in equal cell densities with either 10 iu Epo/ml (A) or 10 iu IL3/ml (B) in soft agar. Colonies were counted after 10 d. Results represent the mean += SD of triplicate samples. (C,D) BM enriched progenitor cells from Sh2b3 knock-out (KO) (C) or WT (D) mice were infected on 2 consecutive days with either Sh2b3 WT or mutant Sh2b3. GFP positive cells were sorted 2 d after the second infection and equal cell number plated in cytokine rich methylcellulose media (M3434, STEMCELL Technologies Inc., Vancouver, BC). Total colonies number was scored after 8-9 d. Results represent the mean += SD of triplicate samples. (E) Western blot demonstrating SH2B3 expression in sorted BaF3-E cells transfected with Sh2b3 variants. Significantly different from WT SH2B3, P < 0.05.
Train_Line_790 We, however, neither detected a decreased interaction between SH2B3 with PH domain mutations and WT JAK2, nor with other known or putative SH2B3 binding partners including 14-3-3 (Jiang et al 2012) and CBL.
Train_Line_791 We sequenced 31 amplicons for 355 patients across the entire TET2 coding region.
Train_Line_792 Genetic and global expression analysis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases identifies C/EBPalpha-deficient AML as a separate entity yielding novel classification schemes.
Train_Line_793 HEL cells were serum-starved for 8 h.
Train_Line_794 Frequency of Genetic Alterations.
Train_Line_795 However, they were younger than most of the patients with germline DDX41 mutations.
Train_Line_796 Such transcriptional patterns have suggested a poor prognosis in AML, though no distinct clinical prognostic association between HoxA gene expression and outcome has been reported in MPN.
Train_Line_797 DNMT3A mutations were more often found in SF3B1-mut patients than in SF3B1-wt patients (35% vs 7%, P < .001; Table 2).
Train_Line_798 Thus they would be expected to respond to imatinib in a similar way to wild-type (WT) KIT.
Train_Line_799 The JH2 domain is a negative regulator of the JH1 kinase activity.
Train_Line_800 Other translocations involving MLL should be reported accordingly: for example, AML with t(6;11)(q27;q23); MLLT4-MLL; AML with t(11;19)(q23;p13.3); MLL-MLLT1; AML with t(11;19)(q23;p13.1); MLL-ELL; AML with t(10;11)(p12;q23); MLLT10- MLL.
Train_Line_801 Diagnosis.
Train_Line_802 In conditional cell line models, induction of C/EBPalpha led to significant growth reduction attributable to proliferation arrest, morphological changes suggestive of airway epithelial differentiation, and ultimately apoptosis.
Train_Line_803 Typically these patients have a combination of severe monocytopenia with mild neutropenia and marginally reduced hemoglobin level, and progression to MDS/AML typically occurs in the second or third decade of life.
Train_Line_804 Alternatively, this may also indicate multiple mutant clones existing entirely independently, perhaps as products of a single reciprocal recombination event occurring in an early clone containing both mutations.
Train_Line_805 SF3B1 mutation types and mutant allele burden Twenty-three mutations were identified mapping in 15 different codons.
Train_Line_806 Four patients showed a heterozygous point mutation in codon S34 leading to a change from serine to phenylalanine and 1 patient had a frameshift mutation in codon E159.
Train_Line_807 Variables with P <= .1 in univariate analysis were included in the model.
Train_Line_808 Estimates for hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CIs were obtained for each significant prognostic factor.
Train_Line_809 Malcovati et al developed a dynamic prognostic model, the WHO-based prognostic scoring system to classify patients into five risk groups which can predict the survival and risk of leukemic evolution at any time during the disease course and seems particularly useful in lower-risk patients.
Train_Line_810 However, reliable estimates can be provided only by whole genome sequencing studies.
Train_Line_811 Studies that interrogate both TET2 function and clonal evolution in parallel are likely to clarify the role of this gene in disease.
Train_Line_812 SUMMARY.
Train_Line_813 Analysis of bands was done with the ImageJ software.
Train_Line_814 Genetic defects of other component of BRCA1-A and BRISC complex.
Train_Line_815 FLT3 stimulates survival and proliferation of leukemic blasts.
Train_Line_816 Therefore, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms are no longer subcategorized.
Train_Line_817 Resistance due to secondary activation loop mutations.
Train_Line_818 No significant associations were observed between BCOR disruptive mutations and sex, age, WBC count, hemoglobin, or platelets (supplemental Table 13).
Train_Line_819 Compared to wild type SH2B3, PH domain mutants have mild loss of function, with no evidence for a dominant-negative effect.

Train_Line_821 The purpose of the study was to determine whether mutations in the RAS proto-oncogenes influenced response to different doses of postremission cytarabine in vivo.
Train_Line_822 However, Jost et al. failed to detect methylation of RARB in any of 23 MF patients.
Train_Line_823 The study also identified older age, anemia, and absence of JAK2V617F as risk factors for fibrotic progression and history of thrombosis and extreme thrombocytosis as risk factors for leukemic transformation.
Train_Line_824 DNA was extracted from bone marrow mononuclear cells or peripheral blood samples collected before transplantation (median, 18 days; range, 9 to 119 days).

Train_Line_827 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_828 Specifically, of the 36 patients with a DNMT3A mutation, 20 (56%) also had a mutation in SF3B1.
Train_Line_829 The C/EBPalpha (C/EBPalpha) gene is localized to chromosome 19q13.1, is intronless, and two protein isoforms are generated from two inframe AUG codons on the mRNA (Fig 1C).
Train_Line_830 The CSF3R (T618I) mutation has been shown to drive a lethal myeloproliferative disorder in a murine model.
Train_Line_831 To quantify gene expression, the quantities of targets were tested in duplicate and normalized to endogenous GAPDH according the delta Ct method.
Train_Line_832 Significant relationships were found between SF3B1 mutant allele burden and percentage of ring sideroblasts (P = .002, Figure 2), or percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts (P = .01).
Train_Line_833 CBL proteins are multifunctional adapter proteins with ubiquitin ligase activity.
Train_Line_834 DDX41 was also found to be affected by somatic mutations in sporadic cases of myeloid neoplasms as well as in a biallelic fashion in 50% of patients with germline DDX41 mutations.
Train_Line_835 SOCS3 represents an attractive target gene in both JAK2 V617F-positive and JAK2 V617F-negative MPD for a number of reasons.
Train_Line_836 These studies have generally compared "more" versus "less" postremission therapy.
Train_Line_837 The comparison of clinical characteristics and laboratory data between patients with and without WT1 mutation is summarized in Table 2.
Train_Line_838 Of these 67 patients with triple-negative findings, 19 underwent Sanger sequencing for mutations in all nine exons of CALR, but no mutations were detected (data not shown).
Train_Line_839 To date, the reason for the selective prognostic effect of DNMT3A mutations in NPM1/FLT3 high-risk but not low-risk patients is unclear.
Train_Line_840 WT1-mutated patients were younger than WT1-wild patients (median, 38.5 years vs 53 years, P < .001).
Train_Line_841 Primary MDS-related AML with --7.
Train_Line_842 EZH2 overexpression is observed in numerous solid tumors such as breast and prostate cancers and may induce dedifferentiation.
Train_Line_843 After quality controls by gel electrophoresis and Bioanalyzer (Agilent), PCR fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), and subsequently pooled in equimolar amounts for library construction using the Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit (Life Technologies).
Train_Line_844 UTX is a histone demethylase, EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase, ASXL1 helps recruit polycomb and trithorax complexes to chromatin, and TET2 converts methylcytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine.
Train_Line_845 These findings demonstrate the association of mutations with prognostic clinical variables and suggest that the LR-PSS may more accurately capture biology driven by particular mutations.
Train_Line_846 Activation of JAK-STAT signaling via MPLW515L is an important pathogenetic event in patients with JAK2V617F-negative MF.
Train_Line_847 We first evaluated clinical parameters that might improve the prediction of prognosis in patients with MDS who had lower-risk disease, as determined by the IPSS score.

Train_Line_850 The 2 spliceosomes differ in their snRNA composition (Figure 1) but share most of the proteins.
Train_Line_851 A bivariate regression analysis, including RS and SF3B1 mutation status, revealed an independent association for SF3B1-mut patients with lower hemoglobin levels (odds ratio = 0.21, 95% CI, 0.06-0.7, P = .01).
Train_Line_852 However, although the efficacy of some of these treatments has been demonstrated in prospective clinical trials, we still lack reliable predictors of response to epigenetic therapy.
Train_Line_853 Sunitinib, like imatinib, selectively binds to the inactive conformation of the kinase domain and fails to inhibit D816 mutant forms.
Train_Line_854 Compared with MPLWT animals, MPLW515L mice demonstrated markedly hypercellular bone marrow with a predominance of maturing myeloid forms and with increased numbers of atypical and dysplastic megakaryocytes which could be found in frequent clusters and exhibited emperipolesis of neutrophils in megakaryocyte cytoplasm (Figure 4C and 4D).
Train_Line_855 Each single-stranded oligomer was labeled using a Biotin 3' End DNA Labeling kit (Pierce) and annealed according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Train_Line_856 The results favored busulfan in terms of both first remission duration (median, 4 years vs. 2 years) and overall survival (10-year survival rates of 70% vs. 55%).

Train_Line_858 In the combined cohort of 1107 patients with analyzed samples, we studied 289 patients with essential thrombocythemia and nonmutated JAK2 and MPL, of whom 195 had mutated CALR (67%).
Train_Line_859 Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.
Train_Line_860 Molecular screening for mutations in exons 1 and 2 of NRAS and KRAS2 identified defects in five and seven individuals with isolated cases of JMML, respectively, none of whom harbored a mutation in PTPN11.
Train_Line_861 The presence of IDH1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival (HR 3.20; 95% CI 1.47-6.99) and a higher rate of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (67% versus 28%, P=0.04).
Train_Line_862 TP53-altered CK-AMLs were characterized by a significantly higher degree of genomic complexity, as assessed by total number of genomic losses and gains, as well as the frequency of high-level DNA amplifications.

Train_Line_867 The 222 French MDS samples were collected at diagnosis in multicenter clinical trials in France between 1999 and 2011 in Paris Cochin (n = 135) and Marseille (n = 87).
Train_Line_868 CD34+ cells from MDS patients were fractionated into immature CD34+ CD38- and mature CD34+ CD38- progenitors.

For both CpG islands, methylated control DNA yields a PCR product within both the unmethylated and methylated-specific PCR due to mispriming of UMSP primers.
Train_Line_873 For ASXL1 expression analysis, MDS samples were dichotomized at the median ASXL1 expression value (median normalized relative copy number [copies of ASXL1 per copy of ABL], 6.323 x 10-5 ; range, 2.386 x10-5 to 32.878 x 10-5), as reported previously.
Train_Line_874 Subsequently, we examined the prognostic impact of IDH mutations in chronic-phase primary myelofibrosis and showed inferior overall and leukemia-free survival in the presence of IDH mutations.
Train_Line_875 Prognostic impact of splice gene mutations.
Train_Line_876 Oscier et al have recently assessed the effect of NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations in a cohort of 494 newly diagnosed CLL patients enrolled in the randomized phase 3 CLL4 trial comparing chlorambucil with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or fludarabine alone.
Train_Line_877 In a recent review article in Blood, Issa described cellular differentiation as an epigenetic process that requires specific and highly ordered DNA methylation and chromatin modification programs.

Train_Line_881 However, it is at present unknown whether other genetic alterations also influence response of patients with AML to treatment with high-dose cytarabine.
Train_Line_882 Correlation with clinical and laboratory factors.
Train_Line_883 Of note, none of the 8 cases with isolated 5q- abnormalities had TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_884 Mutations involving SF3B1 are common in MDS-RS (~80%), and to a lesser extent in PMF (<10%), but hold no independent prognostic value.
Train_Line_885 In regards to aspirin therapy in PV or ET, a recent report suggested that twicea-day aspirin may work better than once daily dose in apparently aspirin-resistant cases.
Train_Line_886 Protein blot analysis.
Train_Line_887 Ongoing analyses from the German CLL Study Group will likely provide additional information.
Train_Line_888 During the clinical follow-ups, 6 of the 8 SRSF-mutated patients showed disease progression to higher risk subtypes, including 5 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation, whereas 31 of the 58 SRSF2-wild patients showed disease progression, including 23 with AML transformation.
Train_Line_889 After 10 to 14 days, the colony numbers were counted under microscope.
Train_Line_890 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_891 In acute myeloid leukemia, mutations of both genes are enriched in patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes and are associated with poor prognosis.
Train_Line_892 The current study suggests a powerful adverse prognostic effect for mutant IDH1 in MDS.
Train_Line_893 Quantification of BCOR transcript levels in 5 primary AML samples with BCOR mutations that introduced a premature stop codon (before the 2nd last exon) and in the 14 BCOR-unmutated AML samples was performed according to the delta-Ct method relative to the calibrator, which was set as 100%.
Train_Line_894 This indicates that defects in RAS, neurofibromin and SHP-2, all involved in regulation of the MAPK cascade, are mutually exclusive in JMML.
Train_Line_895 No difference in overall survival (OS) was noted between included and excluded patients (P = .44).
Train_Line_896 SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION.
Train_Line_897 In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity in the outcome for individual patients in each risk group.
Train_Line_898 WES and bioinformatic analyses were carried out as described previously.
Train_Line_899 The levels of SOCS3 expression in mononuclear cells from JAK2 V617F-positive IMF patients was higher than that in both normal individuals and JAK2 V617F-negative patients (Figure 3C).
Train_Line_900 Exclusivity of TP53 mutation with splicing factor, epigenetic modulators and other oncogenic mutations.
Train_Line_901 The BCOR gene - initially identified as a BCL6 transcriptional corepressor - was recently found to translocate with RARA in acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_902 Variant-allele clusters: Group of mutation with similar VAF, potentially belonging to the same clone or subclone.
Train_Line_903 The product was sequenced using the ABI PRISM 3730xl analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) to screen for the presence of mutations.
Train_Line_904 Forced expression of DDX41 in these DDX41-defective primary cells reduced colony formation (Figure S5D).
Train_Line_905 In the first controlled study in PV, the PV study group (PVSG) randomized 431 patients, between 1967 and 1974, to treatment with either phlebotomy alone or phlebotomy with either oral chlorambucil or intravenous radioactive phosphorus (P32).
Train_Line_906 Table 4. Cox regression analysis for overall survival and event-free survival in MDS patients with mutated (n=7) or unmutated (n=146) IDH1.
Train_Line_907 The mutation rate was especially high in the patients with trisomy 8 (45.5%, P = 0.02; Supplementary Table 2).
Train_Line_908 It remains unclear how acquired mutations in DNMT3A may alter hematopoiesis, but murine knockout models suggest that simple loss of function may not be the predominant mechanism.
Train_Line_909 The Austrian-German MDS cooperative study group identified LDH as an additional poor prognostic variable in IPSS-based risk assessment.
Train_Line_910 Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier-survival analysis of patients with RARS-T according to JAK2V617F-mutation status. The survival probability is significantly better for patients with the mutation than for those without.
Train_Line_911 This effect was lost when stratification included also a "ring sideroblast" category, again because of the strict collinearity between SF3B1 mutation and ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_912 In most PV and ET at diagnosis, the allele burden is extremely low in HSC, and the clonal dominance only occurs during late stages of hematopoiesis, corresponding to the maximum activity of hematopoietic cytokines (Figure 3).
Train_Line_913 Here, we report the discovery of somatic mutations in the BRCC3 gene participating in the BRCA1-A and BRISC complexes in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_914 Our clinical trial protocol allowed an intent-to-treat analysis on the basis of donor availability in patients with CN-AML.
Train_Line_915 CBF leukaemias frequently display KIT mutations in exon 8, usually involving D419, or in exon 17, most commonly affecting D816 or N822, but not in exon 11 (reviewed [47]).
Train_Line_916 Samples from 320 MDS and 35 CMML patients (Table 1) were screened for TET2 mutations at an average sequence coverage of 130X across the gene-coding region using the Roche GS FLX "next-generation sequencing" (NGS) platform.
Train_Line_917 Interestingly, the negative prognostic effect of frameshift mutations was restricted to IPSS low-risk patients (IPSS low and intermediate-1) but was not found in IPSS high-risk patients (intermediate-2 and high) in our patient cohort (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_918 Once activated, KIT autophosphorylates on multiple Y residues which serve as docking sites for downstream effectors.
Train_Line_919 We found that mutations in IDH1 occurred with a frequency of 3.6% in myelodysplastic syndromes (7 mutations in 193 patients) and 7.5% in acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (4 mutations in 53 patients).
Train_Line_920 In the 4 cases lacking evidence for UPD(17p) in SNP profiling, homozygous TP53 mutations possibly resulted from intragenic loss of heterozygosity.
Train_Line_921 The role of gene mutations in driving the disease phenotype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and their contribution to the prognosis is of paramount importance, although they have yet to become incorporated into prognostic scoring system for MDS, unlike other haematological malignancies (Grever et al 2007).
Train_Line_922 Older patients are more likely to suffer treatment-related early death and to exhibit therapeutic resistance.
Train_Line_923 We evaluated OS in 1 uniformly treated patient group compared with all other patients; this comparison is hampered by several factors, including that patients were treated in different studies and that all lenalidomide-treated patients had 5q- syndrome, which has a better prognosis per se.
Train_Line_924 Hence, a reduction in SOCS3 transcript level would be expected in patients carrying a methylated promoter.
Train_Line_925 Because the 52-bp deletion in Patient H_0191 was incorrectly annotated as a 1-bp deletion coupled with a single nucleotide variant by our variant-calling analysis pipeline (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix), we manually reviewed the sequence alignment for this patient.
Train_Line_926 Table 3. Univariate and multivariate analysis for OS and time to AML transformation in MDS patients.
Train_Line_927 Spliceosomal proteins constituted the top functional group associated with DDX41 (Figure S6B), and many of them interact with DDX41 (Figure 5A; Table S5).
Train_Line_928 Adverse-risk AML.
Train_Line_929 Conversely, in MDS, we noted a trend to improve survival in the FLT3-mutated group.
Train_Line_930 However, 2 heterozygous nonsense mutations affecting codons R126 and R295 and 1 heterozygous point mutation causing a change from cysteine to serine in codon C181 were also identified.
Train_Line_931 A total of 133 patients had de novo AML, 31 secondary AML (s-AML) after myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasms, 30 therapy-related (t-AML), and in 40 patients it was unknown.
Train_Line_932 The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications and this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin (PV and ET), phlebotomy (PV) and hydroxyurea (high risk PV and ET).
Train_Line_933 Furthermore, mutantcopy quantification in BM mononuclear cells revealed that BCOR mutations rarely occur at a frequency higher than the other mutations found in the same patient.
Train_Line_934 Since the first report of ASXL1 mutations in MDS, other reports have confirmed the high frequency of ASXL1 mutations in patients with MDS; however, the prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations and the expression levels in MDS are still unknown.
Train_Line_935 Using age >=60 years, hemoglobin below normal value and leukocyte count >15 x 109 /L, one study demonstrated a median survival of >20 years in the absence of all three risk factors and ~9 years in the presence of two of the three risk factors.
Train_Line_936 The primary analysis was performed on overall survival.
Train_Line_937 Other recurring translocations involving RARA should be reported accordingly: for example, AML with t(11;17)(q23;q12); ZBTB16-RARA; AML with t(11;17)(q13; q12); NUMA1-RARA; AML with t(5;17)(q35;q12); NPM1-RARA; or AML with STAT5B-RARA (the latter having a normal chromosome 17 on conventional cytogenetic analysis).
Train_Line_938 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_939 Future studies aimed at identifying mutations present in MPN in which the authors use new-generation sequencing will be crucial not only to characterize the many cases of MPNs with no known molecular cause but also to better understand the evolution of the clone and the synergistic effects of the different mutations.
Train_Line_940 There were no significant differences in age, WHO classification, IPSS-based karyotype, BM blasts, hemoglobin, IPSS, or transfusion dependence between the mutated and the WT patients in any of the 3 genes.
Train_Line_941 Recent progress in genomics technology has resulted in the identification of novel genetic abnormalities and holds the promise of making the systematic characterization of cancer genomes feasible.
Train_Line_942 We also found that TET2, ASXL1, MLL-PTD, PHF6, and DNMT3A mutations can identify patients with intermediate-risk AML who will have an adverse outcome.
Train_Line_943 Anti-proliferative properties of DDX41 were also suggested by the results of cultures performed in the presence of various growth conditions.
Train_Line_944 In the inactive conformation, the N-SH2 domain extensively interacts with the PTP domain, blocking the active site.
Train_Line_945 The main TET2 protein is 2002 amino acids long (starting from the ATG in exon 3), but a second product is predicted to be translated from a RNA species that is not spliced at the 3' side of exon 3 and runs on until a polyA site downstream of exon 4.
Train_Line_946 The formation of myeloid cells is orchestrated by a small number of critical transcription factors, such as PU-1, C/EBPalpha/beta and sigma, IRF-8, RUNX1, SCL, and GFI1.
Train_Line_947 The proportional hazards assumption (constant hazards assumption) was examined using time-dependent covariate Cox regression before conducting multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression.
Train_Line_948 10.1 Prognostic factors in relapsed AML.
Train_Line_949 The data analysis is described in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Train_Line_950 In contrast, mutations in U2AF1 were associated with ASXL1 and DNMT3A mutations, genes relevant for epigenetic regulation.
Train_Line_951 At a median follow-up of 8.4 years from diagnosis, only 1.3% of the patients developed AML.
Train_Line_952 Clonal expansion of myelodysplastic stem cells, ineffective hematopoiesis, and leukemic transformation: a working model of the pathophysiology of myelodysplasia.
Train_Line_953 RCMD and refractory anemia with blast excess can be associated with different combinations of founding mutations, primarily involving genes of RNA splicing (with the only exclusion of SF3B1) or epigenetic regulation and subclonal driver mutations.
Train_Line_954 BCOR mRNA expression levels according to the BCOR mutation status.
Train_Line_955 Thirty-four patients (18%) had RAS mutations.
Train_Line_956 The data in this study show a way in which integrated mutational profiling of a clinical trial cohort can advance our understanding of the biologic characteristics of AML, improve current prognostic models, and inform therapeutic decisions.
Train_Line_957 The other mutation types were observed at much lower frequencies, and many were detected only in a single patient (Fig. 2D, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_958 Integrating mutational and cytogenetic analyses reduced the proportion of patients with intermediate risk from 63%, as assessed by means of cytogenetic analysis alone, to 35% with inclusion of mutational data.
Train_Line_959 TET2 mutations occurred more often in SRSF2-mut and ZRSR2-mut patients compared with SRSF2-wt and ZRSR2-wt patients (44% vs 22%; P = .02 and 56% vs 20%; P < .001, respectively).

Train_Line_961 In analogy to somatic BRCC3 mutations, acquired mutations of other genes involved in DNA repair machinery have been reported in MDS and related conditions, for example, in TP53 and ATM.
Train_Line_962 MUTATION ANALYSIS OF SF3B1 AND SF3B1 MUTANT ALLELE BURDEN.
Train_Line_963 2. Certain ET and rare PV were clonal as judged by X inactivation assays, whereas JAK2V617F was present only in a minority of cells, suggesting the existence of a pre-JAK2 clone, in which the JAK2V617F mutation has occurred.
Train_Line_964 In some instances, this was probably due to the use of unselected cases since most would not have had KIT mutations.
Train_Line_965 The former alteration was not found in public databases, but the prevalence of the latter alteration in the general population is 5/13,006 (ESP).
Train_Line_966 CONCLUSION.
Train_Line_967 CALGB, Cancer and Leukemia Group B; ELN, European Leukemia Net; MVA, multivariate analysis.
Train_Line_968 TP53-deficient cell lines show delayed yH2AX resolution post-irradiation.
Train_Line_969 Selecting patients for transplantation requires careful determination of the predicted risks and potential benefits of the procedure in comparison with other therapeutic approaches, including supportive care and clinical trials.
Train_Line_970 It is highly expressed in haematopoietic cells (Huang et al 1995; Li et al 2000) and inhibits signalling through the tyrosine kinase receptors KIT (Gueller et al 2008; Simon et al 2008), CSF1R (FMS; Gueller et al 2010) and PDGFR (Gueller et al 2011), as well as the nontyrosine kinase receptors MPL (Tong & Lodish, 2004; Gery et al 2007; Seita et al 2007) and the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR; Tong et al 2005).
Train_Line_971 The GATA2-responsive CD34 enhancer-luciferase construct (CD34x2/Luc) and a construct with the GATA binding sites mutated (mutant CD34x2/Luc) were kindly provided by T. Enver, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, UK.
Train_Line_972 One patient with MDS, unclassifiable, by WHO classification was excluded from the statistical analysis.
Train_Line_973 Ring sideroblasts were identified at variable percentages (range, 1%-78%) in 74 of 212 patients assigned to WHO categories that are not defined by this morphologic feature, including MDS del(5q), RA, RCMD, RAEB-1, and RAEB-2.
Train_Line_974 To clarify these observations, additional patients will be required and it will be important to assess SOCS3 methylation and expression within megakaryocytes and myeloid progenitors of both JAK2 V617F-positive and negative patients.
Train_Line_975 In pedigree 4, MDS was first diagnosed at age 13 in the son, who was treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplant at age 15; MDS was later diagnosed at age 53 in the father, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
Train_Line_976 In vitro studies have first shown that TET2 mutations occur before JAK2 mutations during the natural history of sporadic MPNs.
Train_Line_977 Transcript levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were also determined.
Train_Line_978 Similar results have been obtained with exon 12 JAK2 mutant kinases.
Train_Line_979 SRSF2 mutations may become useful for clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions in the future.
Train_Line_980 Curves were constructed for OS and PFS using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using a log-rank test.
Train_Line_981 Independent PCR and Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX sequencing experiments were performed for the confirmation of mutations in all cases (giving > 500X total coverage, on average).
Train_Line_982 Evaluated in patients 15 to 60 years234; APL with t(15;17) excluded; prognostic relapse score is estimated according to the following factors:
Train_Line_983 Although we also observed methylation of the exon 2 CpG island in 38% of MPD patients, the same pattern was detected in 53% of normal individuals.
Train_Line_984 Whereas WT KIT is mostly located on the cell surface, the D816 mutant is largely in intracellular compartments which may account for its ability to activate STAT3.
Train_Line_985 The coding regions of wild-type, p.Thr354Met and p.Leu359Val were cloned into a dual lentiviral vector system which was used to generate HL-60 cells expressing wild-type or mutant GATA2 upon addition of 4HT (Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_986 Of those, 14 of 15 TP53-altered CK-AML relapsed and died, whereas in TP53-unaltered CK-AML 9 of 15 relapsed and died (P = .04).
Train_Line_987 Neither platelet count nor cytoreductive therapy appears to affect either maternal morbidity or pregnancy outcome.
Train_Line_988 It has also been identified as a novel fusion partner of retinoic acid receptor a in a t(X;17)(p11;q12) variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_989 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_990 JAK2 also functions as a chaperone for trafficking of these 2 receptors to the cell surface and their stability.
Train_Line_991 Mutational frequency was 4% (2 of 56) in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 12% (16 of 130) in refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 14% (2 of 14) in MDS-unclassifiable, 14% (6 of 42) in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1 and 23% (8 of 35) in RAEB-2.
Train_Line_992 Genetics of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.
Train_Line_993 Among the 53 patients included in our cohort who died, 72% died as a result of disease, with or without other causes.
Train_Line_994 Patients with TP53 alterations were older and had significantly lower complete remission rates, inferior event-free, relapse-free, and overall survival.
Train_Line_995 The recurrent flaw in data interpretation, when it comes to examining the relationship between leukemic drugs and leukemic transformation, is best illustrated by the largest prospective/retrospective study, to date, in PV (n = 1,638).
Train_Line_996 Eight of the 10 patients with double mutations had a blast count of <10%, compared with 10/20 in the single mutation group (P < 0.02).
Train_Line_997 Screens for additional mutations in other JAK-STAT signaling intermediates in this clinical context including JAK1, JAK3, TYK2, STAT3, or STAT5 have been negative.

Train_Line_999 Immunophenotyping was performed applying multiparameter flow cytometry and 5-color combinations of mAbs selected for the identification of aberrant immunophenotypes.
Train_Line_1000 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_1001 In each case, this was followed by maintenance treatment consisting of four monthly treatments with cytarabine (100 mg/m2 every 12 hours) for 5 days by subcutaneous injection and daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 on the first treatment day.
Train_Line_1002 Simultaneously, we identified a total of 17 cases with somatic DDX41 mutations: 13 with recurrent missense mutations (p.R525H), 3 with non-recurrent missense mutations (c.C674A, p.A225D; c.C962T, p.P321L; and c.G739A, p.E247K), and 1 with splice-site mutation (e11+1).

Train_Line_1004 Median follow-up time for patients who remained alive was 5.1 years (range, 0.052 to 11.7 years).
Train_Line_1005 Therefore, understanding SH2B3 involvement in MPN pathogenesis may have therapeutic significance.
Train_Line_1006 Several driver genes may cause myelodysplasia, and genotype/phenotype relationships have been defined.
Train_Line_1007 Since SF3B1 mutations had a trend toward longer survival, co-occurrence of these two somatic disease alleles may have mitigated any negative effect of DNMT3A mutations on survival in this lower-risk cohort.
Train_Line_1008 LNK, c-CBL, or SOCSs (all negative regulators of signaling pathways), although infrequently targeted, may either drive the disease or synergize with JAK2 and MPL mutations.
Train_Line_1009 From a clinical perspective, an important observation is that different lesions, and sometimes different regions of the same lesion, in imatinib-resistant patients harbour different secondary mutations.
Train_Line_1010 The study was conducted following institutional guidelines.
Train_Line_1011 Validation, using larger patient cohorts and modern technology, is ongoing.
Train_Line_1012 JAK2 V617F is the most common mutation found in MPN.

Train_Line_1014 Anagrelide performed better in preventing venous thrombosis.
Train_Line_1015 SOCS3 promoter methylation was detected in 32% of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis suggesting a possible role for SOCS3 methylation in this disorder.
Train_Line_1016 Patients with mutated CALR had a lower risk of thrombosis and longer overall survival than patients with mutated JAK2.
Train_Line_1017 In a recent international study of 891 patients with true WHO-defined ET, after a median follow-up of 6.2 years, 109 (12%) patients experienced arterial (n = 79) or venous (n = 37) thrombosis.
Train_Line_1018 In a similar analysis, mutant IDH1 was the only detrimental factor for leukemia-free survival (P = 0.001) (Figure 3 and Table 4).
Train_Line_1019 The somatic or germline status of mutations in U2AF1 and SRSF2 was established by evaluating T cells (CD3+CD11b-CD14-CD33-) purified from diagnostic samples by flow cytometry.
Train_Line_1020 It contains several nuclear receptor binding motifs and a carboxy-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) that is predicted to be truncated by most ASXL1 mutations found in patients.
Train_Line_1021 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_1022 These data suggests that BCOR mutations are not involved in disease-initiating events but define the clinical course.
Train_Line_1023 The secondary end point was survival, which was measured from the date of diagnosis until death or date last known alive, censoring for patients alive at last follow-up.
Train_Line_1024 Donor features, such as degree of HLA matching, age, and sex, as well as preparative regimen also influence outcome.

Train_Line_1027 Table 2. Comparison of clinical manifestations and laboratory features between AML patients with and without WT1 mutation.
Train_Line_1028 We observed 15 somatic mutations (n = 342) in genes encoding other members of the DEAD/H-box RNA helicase family.
Train_Line_1029 Differential diagnosis of ET had to include chronic myelogenous leukemia and prefibrotic myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_1030 Whereas prognostic assessment is possible for a significant proportion of CN-AML patients, based on analysis of NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 genes, a fraction of CN-AML patients still lack prognostic molecular biomarkers.
Train_Line_1031 TARGETED RESEQUENCING AND MUTATION SCREENING.
Train_Line_1032 Multivariate analysis of OS was performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model that included age, sex, IPSS risk group or WPSS risk group, and SF3B1 mutation status. IPSS and WPSS were modeled as a continuous covariate.
Train_Line_1033 Second, there appears to be an enrichment of ASXL1 mutations in AML patients with a history of preceding MDS.
Train_Line_1034 We studied 185 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) who were enrolled onto the CALGB treatment trial 8525.
Train_Line_1035 Mutations of ASXL1 and DNMT3A are also expected to result in deregulation of epigenetic modification and those of SRSF2, in abnormality of mRNA splicing.
Train_Line_1036 Bone marrow cells were harvested directly or after 1-3 days of unstimulated culture, and the metaphase chromosomes were banded by the G-banding method as described earlier.
Train_Line_1037 Table 3. Potential implications of somatic mutations of SF3B1 for molecular diagnosis and prognostication of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.
Train_Line_1038 For EMSA-protein blots, the experiment was carried as described above, except that the shifted DNA oligo nucleotides-protein complexes were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane instead of PVDF.
Train_Line_1039 High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standarddose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P = 0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P = 0.67).
Train_Line_1040 Recent studies have shown that mutant DNMT3A was associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AML.
Train_Line_1041 Busulfan is started at 4 mg/day, withheld in the presence of platelets <100 x 109/L or WBC <3 x 109/L, and the dose is reduced to 2 mg/day if the corresponding levels are <150 x 109/L and <5 x 109/L.
Train_Line_1042 Most studies on the JAK2V617F mutation in RARS-T did not provide information concerning the JAK2 allelic ratio or the progression in patients with RARS-T.
Train_Line_1043 Such a risk has been at least partly related to 3 SNPs in the JAK2 gene, including one in the exon 14 defining the haplotype 46/1.
Train_Line_1044 Additional statistical methods are delineated in the Data Supplement.
Train_Line_1045 Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival of 368 MDS patients, based on the 2008 WHO classification. (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for overall survival stratified by IDH (including IDH1 and IDH2) mutations in all patients, (B) by IDH2 mutation alone in all patients, (C) by IDH mutations in patients with low or intermediate 1 (int-1) IPSS score, and (D) by IDH mutations in patients with lower risk MDS with blasts <5% (excluding RAEB).
Train_Line_1046 Although we observed similar mutations in PTPN11 in myeloid disorders and Noonan syndrome, their distribution differed and the molecular lesions were mutually exclusive (Fig. 1d).
Train_Line_1047 It is important to provide estimates of cumulative incidence of death (CID) as well, since just considering the results of CIR may be misleading if for instance CIR is lower for one group but CID is actually higher for that same group.
Train_Line_1048 In the first 10 years, the incidences of thrombotic events, acute leukemia, post-PV MF, and other malignancies were 16, 5, 4, and 8%, respectively.
Train_Line_1049 There was no difference between patients with mutated and wild type TP53 in response to 5-azacitidine, although 4 out of 10 patients with TP53 mutation showed response, the median response duration was only 4 months (range 2-6 months).
Train_Line_1050 Several genes of this superfamily have been found to be mutated in patients with myelodysplasia, including NRAS, KRAS, NF1, PTPN11, and CBL.
Train_Line_1051 MPLW515L-expressing bone marrow and spleen cells exhibit cytokine-independent colony formation, another feature of clinical ET and MF.
Train_Line_1052 These mutations were mutually exclusive and less likely to occur in patients with complex cytogenetics or TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_1053 To model consequences of DDX41 deficiency, we used lentiviral shRNA delivery to knock down DDX41 in K562 cells and observed enhanced proliferation compared to mock-transduced cells (Figures 4A and 4B).
Train_Line_1054 Although the prognosis of AML probably worsens with each year of increasing age, "older" patients are generally considered those 60 or older.
Train_Line_1055 CD34+ cells were isolated from healthy bone marrow.
Train_Line_1056 Other causes of platelet dysfunction in ET or PV include acquired storage pool deficiency, increased platelet activation, decreased adrenergic receptor expression, impaired response to epinephrine, and decreased platelet membrane glycoprotein receptor expression.
Train_Line_1057 Clinical and hematologic data were recorded after MDS patients gave their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the scientific analysis of the samples was approved by the institutional review board of Hannover Medical School (ethical vote 2467).
Train_Line_1058 The laboratory detection of JAK2V617F is highly sensitive (97% sensitivity) and virtually 100% specific for distinguishing PV from other causes of increased hematocrit the possibility of false positive or false negative mutation test result is effectively addressed by the concomitant measurement of serum erythropoietin (Epo) level, which is expected to be subnormal in more than 85% of patients with PV.
Train_Line_1059 A study by the German-Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) provided evidence that those AML patients whose molecular genetic profile predicts a favorable prognosis, such as CN-AML with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, may also not benefit from allogeneic HSCT.
Train_Line_1060 Because of this, a systematic determination of ASXL1 mutational status in myeloid malignancies should help in prognosis assessment.
Train_Line_1061 The three mutation groups were phenotypically similar, with the exception of higher RS% (P < 0.0001) in patients with SF3B1 mutations.
Train_Line_1062 Among 52 patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), a subtype of MDS, the JAK2V617F allele was detected in only two cases.
Train_Line_1063 For serial methylcellulose replating assay, CD34+ cells were plated on methylcellulose with cytokines.
Train_Line_1064 In the remaining 9 patients, mutant clones were found at a similar RMA.
Train_Line_1065 Adjusted CIR curves were generated using average covariate values from the multivariable CIR model.
Train_Line_1066 Cbl-b-deficient mice lack a hematologic phenotype.
Train_Line_1067 Despite this elevation in serum 2-HG, the KI mice had a normal lifespan and were viable and fertile.
Train_Line_1068 Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was carried out to assess expression levels. Calculations were performed using SigmaPlot 10 (Systat Software, London, UK) and MedCalc (Mariakerke, Belgium).
Train_Line_1069 As previously reported for ET, JAK2V617F positive patients in our cohort had significantly higher white cell counts in keeping with a proliferative signal of JAK2V617F to the myeloid lineage in RARS-T.
Train_Line_1070 Four patients (50%) with SRSF2 mutation acquired novel mutations of other genes during follow-ups (Table 4), whereas 11 patients (29%) without SRSF2 mutation did so (P = .071; data not shown).
Train_Line_1071 The frequency is low in low-grade disorders but greater in late MDS, AML, and in proliferative CMML.
Train_Line_1072 These data suggest that mutations that activate the JAK2 pathway are a common pathogenetic event in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_1073 The Genome Center's analysis pipeline was used to identify sequence variants and we restricted our analysis to changes with predicted translational consequences (i.e., nonsynonymous substitutions, insertion/deletions, and splice site nucleotide changes) and identified 13 mutations in 12 bone marrow samples from 150 MDS samples (8.0% of cases) (Table 2).
Train_Line_1074 Although we found a significant relationship between this percentage and SF3B1 mutant allele burden, this does not fully explain the above variability, suggesting that additional factors play a role in the RARS phenotypic expression.
Train_Line_1075 Pregnancy does not appear to alter the course of AML, with more than 75% of patients achieving CR after standard chemotherapy.
Train_Line_1076 Most cases express early hematopoiesis-associated antigens (eg, CD34, CD38, and HLA-DR) and lack most markers of myeloid and monocytic maturation; while MPO is negative by cytochemistry, detection of intracytoplasmic MPO antigens may be positive by flow cytometry in at least a fraction of blasts.

Train_Line_1078 In systemic mastocytosis (SM) the predominant activation loop mutation results in substitution of D816 usually by V but sometimes by H or Y.
Train_Line_1079 Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K caused death of these cells in vitro and mutation of the major KIT recruitment site for PI3K (Y721F) blocked tumourigenicity in syngeneic mice in vivo.
Train_Line_1080 The subgroup "AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities" comprises several primary AML entities.
Train_Line_1081 A recent European collaborative study has shown that patients with RARS-T have better overall survival than those with RARS and shorter overall survival than those with essential thrombocythemia, underlying the clinical relevance of interactions between different mutant genes.
Train_Line_1082 To screen for insertion and deletion mutations in CALR exon 9, we designed PCR primers spanning exon 9 and labeled the forward primer with 6-carboxyfluorescein.
Train_Line_1083 It is currently debated whether the recurrent ASXL1 variation (c.1934dupG;p.Gly646TrpfsX12), which accounts for the majority of patients who we classified as mutated for ASXL1, is a bona fide somatic mutation or an artifact.
Train_Line_1084 In contrast, all patients with mutated RAS in the LDAC group experienced relapse, all but two patients within 16 months after achievement of a complete remission.
Train_Line_1085 In addition to the prognostic importance of mutations in epigenetic modifiers, there may be important therapeutic implications of specific mutations in epigenetic pathways.
Train_Line_1086 In a subgroup of 325 MDS patients, a quantitative enumeration of ring sideroblasts after Perls staining was performed using recently established consensus criteria to study the relationship between SF3B1 mutation status or mutant allele burden and the proportion of bone marrow ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_1087 Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the WT1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival and relapse-free survival among total patients and the CN-AML group.
Train_Line_1088 As shown in Table 3, incorporation of SF3B1 mutations may add relevant information to the risk stratification systems currently used in clinical practice.
Train_Line_1089 In line with the initial report in which 4 of the 10 identified BCORL1 mutations were observed in AML-MRC, BCORL1 mutations were most often found in patients with AML-MRC disease (9.1%).
Train_Line_1090 The quantitative PCR had a sensitivity of approximately 0-1% and identified SOCS3 promoter methylation in an additional 11 out of these 37 MF patients (in purified granulocytes from 7 patients, purified mononuclear cells from 3 patients and in both from 1 patient).
Train_Line_1091 These findings suggest that U2AF1 mutation may play a role in the development, but not progression, of MDS.
Train_Line_1092 This review covers the occurrence of oncogenic KIT mutations in different cancers and the molecular basis of their action.
Train_Line_1093 Patients with TP53 mutation had only 1.4-fold higher expression of TP53 when compared to patients with wild type TP53 (P < 0.05, one tail) (Figure S2), which falls within the standard error of this technique (Ct difference of 0.5).
Train_Line_1094 Unlike mutations in SF3B1, mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 were not associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_1095 Not unexpectedly, many monosomies described in chromosome banding analysis were not real monosomies but were part of chromosomal material hidden in unbalanced translocations or marker chromosomes.
Train_Line_1096 However, because of small patient number in these two studies, no statistical analyses were done to evaluate whether there was a significant association of ASXL1 mutation with these mutations.
Train_Line_1097 Investigators at the MD Anderson Cancer Center have proposed such a prognostic model that more finely stratifies the predicted overall survival of patients with MDS with lower IPSS risk, although this model has not been confirmed in an independent cohort.
Train_Line_1098 Table 1. Incidence of PTPN11 mutations (mutated cases/studied cases).
Train_Line_1099 Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; IPSS, international prognostic scoring system; IPSS-R, revised IPSS. aThe model was generated from a stepwise Cox regression model that included age, IPSS-R and gene mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, DNMT3A, IDH and SRSF2.
Train_Line_1100 Study eligibility criteria included availability of bone marrow histology and cytogenetic information at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic.
Train_Line_1101 Mutations of TP53 predicted a shorter overall survival after adjusting for either the IPSS (HR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.07 to 5.52) or the LR-PSS (HR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.16 to 5.99) but were rare in this cohort of patients with lower-risk MDS (n = 7).
Train_Line_1102 Supernatants were harvested 24 h later and filtered (Nalgene 45 mum syringe filter) (Nalge Nunc Int.).
Train_Line_1103 Here, we define the clinical significance of these mutations in MDS and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN).
Train_Line_1104 Grade 2-3 according to the European classification: diffuse, often coarse fiber network with no evidence of collagenization (negative trichrome stain) or diffuse, coarse fiber network with areas of collagenization (positive trichrome stain).
Train_Line_1105 Figure 1 provides a practical diagnostic algorithm that begins with peripheral blood mutation screening for JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_1106 As these mutations were predicted to significantly alter protein function, with a majority being nonsense or Indel mutations likely to abrogate TET2 protein function completely, the data strongly implicate TET2 mutations as having a distinct, yet unknown, biologic significance, rather than being a chance event, and is consistent with a tumor-suppressor role for this protein.
Train_Line_1107 The acquisition of nonsense mutations in this gene, resulting in the expression of truncated CSF3R protein, has been previously found to be associated with progression to MDS/AML in patients with severe congenital neutropenia.
Train_Line_1108 Interestingly, our data suggest that patients harboring ASXL1 frameshift mutations not only have a shorter OS but also have reduced time to AML progression in univariate and multivariate analyses.
Train_Line_1109 In the case of reduced-intensity transplantation, the pace of disease may not allow enough time for adequate graft-versus-tumor effect to take place.
Train_Line_1110 We noted that both twins (family 2) with germline and somatic DDX41 mutations responded well to lenalidomide, despite the absence of del(5q) (List et al, 2006), which led us to investigate the association between somatic DDX41 mutations and response to lenalidomide within a cohort of 111 patients with and without del(5q) treated with this drug (Table S2).
Train_Line_1111 Variants previously reported as somatic were included in further analyses; remaining variants listed as germline polymorphisms in the Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP build 132), reported as germline in other studies, or present in matched buccal swab DNA (available for 140 samples [49%]) were excluded.
Train_Line_1112 Each snRNP is composed of a single uridine-rich small nuclear RNA (snRNA) accompanied by multiple proteins and has a specific function.
Train_Line_1113 We also identified two rare germline events: DHX29 c.G1627A (p.V543M) and c.G1561A (p.E521K), not found in ESP.
Train_Line_1114 A subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who are predicted to have lower-risk disease as defined by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) demonstrate more aggressive disease and shorter overall survival than expected.
Train_Line_1115 Loss of function EZH2 mutations identified in MPN patients have been suggested to decrease the transcriptionally repressive H3K27 trimethylation chromatin mark.
Train_Line_1116 The most common mutations, each accounting for 25% of the total number, were a G>T transversion at position 181 and a G>A transition at position 226, predicting D61Y and E76K substitutions within the N-SH2 domain, respectively.
Train_Line_1117 Similar phenotypic associations (Figure 3B) (Boultwood et al, 2007) and effects on OS (Figure 3D) were observed in cases with decreased DDX41 expression.
Train_Line_1118 Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier survival curves. OS (A) and RFS (B) according to WT1 mutation status in 330 AML patients receiving standard intensive chemotherapy.
Train_Line_1119 Among the 466 MDS patients according to the FAB classification, 106 (22.7%) patients had ASXL1 mutations, including 96 patients with frameshift mutations and 10 with nonsense mutations.
Train_Line_1120 Thus, a SETD2 mutation-mediated decrease of H3K36me3 may be an independent and distinct epigenetic mechanism to potentiate leukemic transformation and progression in cooperation with another genetic or epigenetic abnormality.
Train_Line_1121 Taking into account these limitations, only 4 to 6 genes (SF3B1, TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, and RUNX1) have been found to be consistently mutated in >=10% of MDS patients, whereas a long tail of about 40 to 50 additional genes are mutated in smaller subsets.
Train_Line_1122 However, the role of SOCS3 in regulating JAK2V617F signaling is controversial.
Train_Line_1123 Both MYST3 and EPC1 are epigenetic regulators and these fusion proteins probably disrupt epigenetic protein complexes.
Train_Line_1124 Leukemia-free survival was calculated from the date of first referral to date of LT (uncensored) or death/last contact (censored).
Train_Line_1125 The ASXL1 exon 12 until the stop codon was amplified by three pairs of primers and sequenced by another six internal primers, as described by Gelsi-Boyer et al, with mild modification.
Train_Line_1126 Conversely, hypermethylation of an upstream promoter region of the C/EBPalpha gene (-1422 to -896 relative to the transcriptional start site) is a very common event in non-small-cell lung cancers (detected in approximately 65% of primary lung tumors) and appears to be the major mechanism for gene silencing.
Train_Line_1127 In multivariable analysis, predictors of arterial thrombosis included age more than 60 years, thrombosis history, cardiovascular risk factors including tobacco use, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus, leukocytosis (> 11 x 10(9)/L), and presence of JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_1128 WHY WOULD SEVERAL GENETIC EVENTS BE REQUIRED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MPN?
Train_Line_1129 In contrast, only male gender predicted venous thrombosis.
Train_Line_1130 We demonstrated an overall TET2 mutation rate of 15.5% in a cohort of 355 patients, with a TET2 mutation rate of 12%, specifically among MDS patients (vs 46% in CMML).
Train_Line_1131 The BCOR gene is located on chromosome Xp11.4 and is targeted by disruptive germline mutations that cause the X-linked oculo facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) syndrome in heterozygous females and prenatal lethality in hemizygous males.
Train_Line_1132 Remaining variants were considered candidate somatic mutations.
Train_Line_1133 The 57-year-old male MDS index patient selected for whole-exome sequencing was enrolled on the prospective noninterventional multicenter MDS04 trial (EUDRACT: 2010-A00033-36).
Train_Line_1134 GO is a humanized anti-CD33 antibody chemically linked to the cytotoxic agent calicheamicin that inhibits DNA synthesis and induces apoptosis.
Train_Line_1135 JAK2, MPL mutations), are considered mutually exclusive (Cross, 2011).
Train_Line_1136 Cohort 1 was from the MLL (n = 200) and was analyzed using a next-generation amplicon deep-sequencing assay.
Train_Line_1137 The US Intergroup Study demonstrated an advantage for allogeneic HSCT for patients with unfavorable cytogenetics with a survival of 44% versus 15% for patients receiving only a single cycle of HiDAC consolidation chemotherapy, although the number of patients was small and the consolidation limited.
Train_Line_1138 Table 2 describes the IDH mutation type, WHO histological category, karyotype and the IPSS-R prognostic scores of the 34 patients with IDH mutations.
Train_Line_1139 A total of 489 patients with AML were examined for mutations in DNMT3A by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_1140 Ninety patients (40%) had SRSF2 mutations, 13 (6%) had SF3B1 mutations, and 20 (9%) had U2AF35 mutations.
Train_Line_1141 To delineate the mechanism of somatic SH2B3 mutations in the pathogenesis of MPN, we studied the effect of different SH2B3 PH domain mutations that have been identified in MPN patients (E208Q, A215V and G220V) on the JAK2 signalling pathway.
Train_Line_1142 BCOR mutation frequencies did not differ between the 222 French and the 132 Asian MDS patients (5% vs 3%; P = .59).
Train_Line_1143 Although we did not quantify JAK2 V617F tumor burden, our data show that SOCS3 expression is, in general, highest in those patients with increased levels of JAK2 V617F.
Train_Line_1144 In 184 of 197 patients, FLT3-ITD status was available and was mutated in 67 patients (35%).
Train_Line_1145 Preparation of mononuclear cells and genomic DNA was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_1146 Mutations may alter clinical parameters in a manner that is accurately captured by the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_1147 In a large study of PMF patients ASXL1 mutations were associated with shorter overall survival.
Train_Line_1148 U2AF1 mutation was also not associated with patients' MDS subgroups or risks.
Train_Line_1149 However, benefits of allogeneic HSCT have been limited by the high TRM.
Train_Line_1150 Somatic mutations in PTPN11 in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_1151 Sequential study during the clinical course showed the instability of WT1 mutations during disease progression.
Train_Line_1152 Laboratory evidence of AvWS occurs in the majority of patients with ET or PV and is characterized by the loss of large von Willebrand factor multimers, linked to their increased proteolysis by the ADAMTS13 cleaving protease, in a platelet count-dependent fashion.
Train_Line_1153 Clinically, BRCC3 mutations were also related to higher age (P=0.01), although prognosis was not affected.
Train_Line_1154 In recent years, a large number of somatic mutations affecting new classes of genes have been identified in MDS and related disorders, providing clues to the molecular pathogenesis of these diseases.
Train_Line_1155 These results are likely to reflect the difference in kinase activation mechanisms between the two classes of mutant described above.
Train_Line_1156 U2AF1 mutation occurred more frequently (4/11, or 36.4% vs. 30/433, or 6.9%, P = 0.006) in the patients with isolated 220/20q- than others (Supporting Information Table III).
Train_Line_1157 In a trial by the AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG), 1 versus 2 courses with HiDAC (3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1-3) in induction produced equal CR rates, disease-free survival (DFS) and moderate toxicity.
Train_Line_1158 SOMATIC MUTATIONS OF SF3B1 IN PATIENTS WITH MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_1159 At the N-terminus, the JH5-JH7 domains contain a FERM (Band-4.1, ezrin, radixin, and moesin)-like motif, which plays a role in the binding to the cytosolic domain of cognate cytokine receptors.
Train_Line_1160 For detailed information, the reader is referred to a recent comprehensive review article by Padgett.
Train_Line_1161 Surprisingly, in the IMF group as a whole, SOCS3 promoter methylation did not correlate with reduced transcript level.
Train_Line_1162 P < 0.05 was used to define statistical significance.
Train_Line_1163 MPL and JAK2 mutation analyses were performed according to previously published methods.
Train_Line_1164 Both normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells and AML cells lacking BCOR mutations showed a clear band, of variable intensity, corresponding to the full-length BCOR protein (192 kDa predicted molecular weight [MW]; Figure 3B).

Train_Line_1168 SRSF2 mutation was detected in 34 (14.6%) of the 233 patients (supplemental Figure 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Train_Line_1169 Among 470 patients, 330 (70.2%) patients received intensive induction chemotherapy (idarubicin 12 mg/m2 per day on days 1-3 and cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per day on days 1-7) and then consolidation chemotherapy with 2 to 4 courses of high-dose cytarabine (2000 mg/m2 every 12 hours on days 1-4, total 8 doses), with or without an anthracycline if complete remission (CR) was achieved.
Train_Line_1170 It is noteworthy that the common sites of KIT mutation differ markedly between cancers.
Train_Line_1171 This has been demonstrated by Walter et al in their study of the clonal architecture of secondary AML.
Train_Line_1172 Overexpression of WT SH2B3 inhibited the growth of HEL cells (Fig 4A).
Train_Line_1173 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a complex disease caused by mutations, deregulated gene expression, and epigenetic modifications of genes leading to increased proliferation and decreased differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells.
Train_Line_1174 Several other trials are currently underway (reviewed [43]).
Train_Line_1175 The number of patients with specific genetic mutations. dBiallelic SETD2 mutation.
Train_Line_1176 AML indicates acute myeloid leukemia; ET, essential thrombocythemia; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; MPN, myeloproliferative neoplasms; PMF, primary myelofibrosis; and PV, polycythemia vera.
Train_Line_1177 The OS and AML transformation rate was similar between mutated and WT patients when considering all 4 investigated splicing genes (SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1; OS, HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 0.8-1.99; P = .31; supplemental Figure 4A; AML transformation, HR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.68-2.39; P = .48; supplemental Figure 4B).
Train_Line_1178 The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying JAK2 V617F-negative cases of MPD are thought to reflect abnormalities affecting cytokine receptor signaling.
Train_Line_1179 Familial syndromes predisposing to MDS or AML include bone marrow failure inherited disorders (Diamond-Blackfan, dyskeratosis congenita, severe congenital neutropenia), DNA repair deficiency syndromes, Noonan syndrome and neurofibromatosis I, Down syndrome, and familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy (associated with germ-line mutations of RUNX1 or CEBPA).
Train_Line_1180 On the other hand, among the 80 ASXL1-wild patients who were sequentially studied, 36 patients had disease progression, including 20 patients with AML transformation.
Train_Line_1181 Table 3. Association of WT1 mutation with chromosomal abnormalities.
Train_Line_1182 ASXL1 mutations are common not only in MDS, but also in AML, CMML, and PMF, and are generally associated with poor clinical outcome in all myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_1183 Several novel classes of genes frequently affected by somatic mutations have been found in MDS, including genes involved in cohesin complexes and spliceosomes, genes related to methylation and genes of novel receptor tyrosine kinases.
Train_Line_1184 Retroviral transplantation assays with mutated c-CBL induce a mastocytosis phenotype and myeloid leukemia, albeit with a long latency.
Train_Line_1185 In contrast, SF3B1 mutation was associated with a normal or increased platelet count (4% with < 50 x 109/L v 15% with 50 to 200 x 109/L v 51% with > 200 x 109/L; P < .001).
Train_Line_1186 Alternatively, some mutations may yield orthogonal information about the MDS phenotype that is not well captured by standard clinical variables.
Train_Line_1187 Despite the recent discovery of the JAK2V617F allele, questions remain regarding the molecular pathogenesis of PV, ET, and MF.
Train_Line_1188 The SH2-mutated type showed most severe disruption of LNK function compared to the mutated form in PH domain or C-terminal tyrosine residue.
Train_Line_1189 The study enrolled 518 patients with PV in a double-blind randomized trial to low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) or placebo.
Train_Line_1190 The frequent cooccurrence of LNK mutation and JAK2 V617F was also observed in previous study, which reported LNK mutations were found at similar frequencies between JAK2 V617F-negative and positive patients.
Train_Line_1191 In some JAK2V617F MPNs associated with the 20q deletion, this deletion was present in the majority of cells, whereas the JAK2V617F burden was low116; furthermore, JAK2V617F was not found in some erythropoietin-independent colonies.
Train_Line_1192 PATIENTS.
Train_Line_1193 Next-generation sequencing analyses of AML and related disorders identified mutations in 2 chromosome X genes, BCOR and BCORL1, which code for related transcriptional corepressors.
Train_Line_1194 Abbreviations: CBF, core binding factor; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; HDAC, high-dose cytarabine; LDAC, low-dose cytarabine.
Train_Line_1195 Furthermore, TET2 mRNA is highly expressed in normal myeloid progenitor cells, granulocytes, and erythroid cells, whereas granulocytes isolated from MDS cases have reduced TET2 expression, highlighting the importance of wild-type levels of TET2 protein in myelopoeisis.
Train_Line_1196 The utility of SRSF2 mutations for treatment stratification should be assessed in future studies.
Train_Line_1197 In the report by Qian et al, MDS patients with U2AF1 mutation also seemed younger than patients without this mutation, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Train_Line_1198 It has also been shown that various mutations have differential effects on the activation of signalling pathways downstream of KIT.
Train_Line_1199 LFS was calculated from the date of first referral to date of leukemic transformation (uncensored) or death/last contact (censored).
Train_Line_1200 These mutations are expected to disrupt the PH domain and consequently mislocalize LNK in the cytoplasm abrogating its function to JAK2.
Train_Line_1201 KIT mutations also occur in about 30% of cases of unilateral ovarian dysgerminomas but not other histological types.
Train_Line_1202 ASXL1 comprises 12 exons and is expressed in most hematopoietic cell types.
Train_Line_1203 Bleeding diathesis in ET or PV is currently believed to be multi-factorial in etiology.
Train_Line_1204 Consistent with this finding, TP53 alterations in our study were associated with resistance to "3 + 7"-based induction chemotherapy (Tables 1 and 2).
Train_Line_1205 Moreover, as in Noonan's syndrome, all somatic mutations described were missense mutations and they were almost exclusively localized in exon 3, rarely in exon 13.
Train_Line_1206 This study provided the basis for FDA approval of imatinib for treatment of metastatic GIST.
Train_Line_1207 METHODS.
Train_Line_1208 An example is a recent study in which graded down-regulation of multiple candidate genes by RNA interference was used to identify RPS14 as a causal gene for the MDS 5q- syndrome.
Train_Line_1209 Actually, recent data have demonstrated a loss of ASXL1 protein in leukemia samples with ASXL1 mutation, indicating that these mutations are loss-offunction disease alleles.
Train_Line_1210 However, the question arises of which molecular mechanisms may associate the JAK2 mutation with anemia in RARS-T, while it confers a multilineage proliferative advantage in other MPD.
Train_Line_1211 Transcription factors are well characterized as targets of dominant negative or constitutively active mutations in cancer, with RUNX1 mutations leading to a spectrum of outcomes including AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, consistent with both tumor suppressor gene and dominant oncogene models.
Train_Line_1212 Combining mutational and microarray findings, 164 of 234 (70%) CK-AMLs exhibited TP53 alteration (mutation and/or loss of TP53); 71 of 164 (43%) cases had biallelic TP53 alteration by hemizygous mutation pattern, and 38 of 70 (54%) cases without TP53 loss exhibited homozygous TP53 mutation caused by UPD(17p) in 15 of 19 SNP-analyzed cases.
Train_Line_1213 Base sequence and mapping quality thresholds were both set to 25 (58 in Burrows-Wheeler Aligner).
Train_Line_1214 Emerging studies have identified several other proteins whose activity is affected by 2-HG.
Train_Line_1215 Koo et al have demonstrated that cells harboring an activated RAS oncogene fail to arrest in the S phase of the cell cycle in response to cytarabine treatment and that this results in their apoptotic death.
Train_Line_1216 Additionally, TP53 mutations were strongly associated with deletion of 5q-, either in isolation or part of CK (Fig 1).
Train_Line_1217 WT1 mutation was still an independent poor prognosis for OS and RFS (relative risk = 3.752, 95% confidence interval 1.195-11.783, P = .024; and relative risk = 3.806, 95% confidence interval 1.588-9.112, P = .003, respectively, Table 6).
Train_Line_1218 In parallel with studies on the frequency and clinical importance of TET2 mutations in AML, biochemical studies revealed that the TET family of proteins have a dioxygenase enzymatic activity, dependent on Fe(II) and a-ketoglutarate (a-KG), located in a conserved C-terminal catalytic domain which catalyzes the conversion of the methyl group at the 5-position of cytosine of DNA (5-methylcytosine [5mC] to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine [5hmC]) (Figure 2).
Train_Line_1219 BCOR-disruptive mutations were found in 10/262 (3.8%) patients (Figure 1).
Train_Line_1220 IDH2 exon 4 was amplified using sense, 5'-CCACTATTATCTCTGTCC TC-3' and anti-sense, 5'-GCTAGGCGAGGAGCTCCAGT-3'.
Train_Line_1221 [NO ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_1222 Each mutation was capable of causing ligand-independent KIT activation as demonstrated by tyrosine auto-phosphorylation and promotion of factor-independent growth of murine Ba/F3 cells.
Train_Line_1223 As previously reported, mutations of SF3B1 were highly enriched in samples from patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, present in 78% of patients v 13% of patients without refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (P < .001).
Train_Line_1224 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_1225 Information on WHO subtype was not available for 27 patients.
Train_Line_1226 Better understanding of this prototypical differentiation factor will likely open doors for novel therapeutic strategies to modulate critical differentiation pathways in cancer.
Train_Line_1227 The expression of TP53 mRNA was not altered significantly in mutant TP53 and this is consistent with data from other cancers where TP53 mRNA levels do not mirror protein level (el-Mahdani et al 1997).
Train_Line_1228 Clinically, TP53 alterations appear to be associated with inferior outcome.
Train_Line_1229 Although the incidence of TET2 mutations in this study was slightly lower (15.5% overall; 12% MDS and 46% CMML) than that reported by other centers, this could be accounted for by the observation that advanced age correlates with an increased incidence of TET2 mutations, and that the median age in our study (64 years) was lower, compared with other studies.
Train_Line_1230 With respect to the prognostic relevance of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, in a recent collaborative study aimed to develop the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) for MDS, patient databases from international institutions were coalesced to assemble a combined database including 7012 patients.
Train_Line_1231 Likewise, it is unknown whether mutations in different genes will impact the expression of a common set of genes, or whether each mutation results in a unique gene expression signature.
Train_Line_1232 Unfortunately, studies using dasatinib in SM patients have yielded disappointing results.
Train_Line_1233 Met354 or deletion of Thr355 may affect overall ZF structure (Supplementary Fig. 4), although we cannot exclude disrupted heterodimerization with GATA2's interacting partners (Supplementary Table 7).
Train_Line_1234 All of three patients with LNK mutation also harbored JAK2 V617F mutation.
Train_Line_1235 A total of 36 types of insertions or deletions were identified that all cause a frameshift to the same alternative reading frame and generate a novel C-terminal peptide in the mutant calreticulin.
Train_Line_1236 Subsequent analysis of this patient revealed an absence of IDH1 mutations but a mutation in IDH2 (R172L).
Train_Line_1237 All samples analyzed by direct Sanger sequencing contained at least 12.5% leukemic cells in the case of male patients or at least 25% leukemic cells in the case of female patients, which were used as thresholds for this method to unequivocally detect the presence of a hemizygous or heterozygous mutation in BCOR (located on chromosome X), in a major tumor clone.
Train_Line_1238 Although evidence is lacking, it is generally accepted to keep the hemoglobin level above 8 g/dL, especially in thrombocytopenic patients.
Train_Line_1239 The 15 mutations with a frequency >= 1% were evaluated along with age (< 60 v >= 60 years), sex, and either IPSS or LR-PSS (excluding age) as candidates in stepwise Cox regression modeling.
Train_Line_1240 The strength of our study was the availability of serial samples during 5-azacitidine treatment, which enabled us to monitor variations in mutant allele burden using next generation sequencing.
Train_Line_1241 A number of these therapies have been tested specifically in preclinical contexts of MLL-translocated AML and studies in broader biological and genetic contexts are needed to understand their efficacy in a wider array of AML subtypes.
Train_Line_1242 Table 1. Mutations in recurrently mutated epigenetic modifiers in adults with AML and their clinical relevance and associations.
Train_Line_1243 We sequenced 14 amplicons for all the 318 samples across the entire TP53 coding region, including untranslated exon 1 (Table SIa).
Train_Line_1244 Statistics.
Train_Line_1245 WT1 mutations in 470 adult patients with de novo non-M3 AML.
Train_Line_1246 We also compared the effect of the different SH2B3 mutants on colony formation of BM progenitor cells.
Train_Line_1247 UPN, unique patient number (bold indicates patients with double mutant clones), WHO, World Health Organization; IPSS, International Prognostic Scoring System; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; M, male; F, female; (s)AML, (secondary) acute myeloid leukaemia; RCMD, refractory anaemia with multilineage dysplasia; RAEB1/2, refractory anaemia with excess blasts type 1/2; (t)MDS, (therapy-related) myelodysplastic symdrome; MPD, myeloproliferative disease; -U, unclassifiable; Int, intermediate; NA, not applicable (NA for IPSS category; as 3 patients had blasts >30% and one had a proliferative picture, NA for AML progression as patients had >20% blasts at time of sampling); del, deletion of 17p.13; CN-LOH, copy neutral-loss of heterozygosity; ND, not done; UPD, uniparental disomy; HSCT, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; EPO, erythropoietin; GCSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; chemo, chemotherapy.
Train_Line_1248 Neither platelet count nor cytoreductive therapy appears to affect either maternal morbidity or pregnancy outcome.
Train_Line_1249 For example, in MDSs, ASXL1 mutations are more frequent in U2AF35-mutated patients than in U2AF35 wild-type patients.
Train_Line_1250 In another study of 33 young patients (<50 years of age) with ET treated with pipobroman only and followed for a median of almost 16 years, the complete remission rate was 94% and only one patient (3%) developed AML, whereas no patient experienced thrombotic complications.
Train_Line_1251 A recent AMLSG study suggests that AML with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD may benefit from the addition of all-trans retinoic acid to intensive induction and consolidation therapy, although this finding awaits confirmation by further studies.
Train_Line_1252 In nearly all these cases, the 2 events have occurred in 2 different cells; moreover, independent acquisitions of JAK2V617F in a single patient have been reported.
Train_Line_1253 MPN cells with mutant JAK2 can also have SH2B3 PH domain mutations.
Train_Line_1254 The PTPN11 gene (protein-tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor-type, 11), localized in 12q24, encodes a protein with tyrosine phosphatase activity called SHP-2 (Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2).
Train_Line_1255 HL-60 promyelocytes differentiate into granulocytes upon exposure to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), resulting in upregulation of CD11b, cessation of proliferation and subsequent promotion of apoptosis (Fig. 4).
Train_Line_1256 Among patients with IDH2 mutations, 25 (96%) were IDH2 R140Q mutant, whereas one patient carried both the IDH2 R140Q and R140W mutations.
Train_Line_1257 7.2 Postremission therapy.
Train_Line_1258 Therefore, the following two things are required in order to justify the risk of unknown long-term health effects of non-conventional drug therapy such as with IFN-a or JAK inhibitors: (i) experimental or in vivo demonstration of disease-modifying activity and (ii) controlled studies to show added value.
Train_Line_1259 Variables with P <= .1 in univariate analysis for OS were included in the model.
Train_Line_1260 The detailed splicing mechanism is complex and relies on 5 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) and their associated proteins, which form the spliceosome.
Train_Line_1261 However, our results indicate that the JAK2 inhibitors may not be selective for cells expressing the mutated CALR, as compared with the CALR nonmutated cells.
Train_Line_1262 In a Phase II study, dasatinib was shown to have minor benefit for treatment of metastatic melanoma and to cause substantial toxicity.
Train_Line_1263 TP53 mutations and IHC.
Train_Line_1264 The Chronic Myeloid Disorders Working Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium has just completed a study of targeted gene sequencing in a large cohort of patients with MDS and closely related neoplasms.
Train_Line_1265 The primers used were as follows: 7F 5J GACCTACGTGAATG TTCACATG-3' and 7R 5'-ACCAACACCTGGATCAGACCT-3'; 9F 5'-TGCAGACATTGCAGGCATGGCAGG-3' and 9R 5'-GCACTATTCCTTCTCTAACT GAG-3'.
Train_Line_1266 In fact, most mutated CBL forms behave as loss-of-function molecules having a dominant-negative effect not only on c-CBL but also on CBL-b, leading to an excessive sensitivity to a variety of growth factors.
Train_Line_1267 SIGNALLING PATHWAYS DOWNSTREAM OF KIT.
Train_Line_1268 As shown in Table 3, the IPSS risk group was strongly associated with OS, but the SF3B1 mutation status remained an independent predictor of better survival even after adjustment for IPSS.
Train_Line_1269 Xiao et aldemonstrated that SRSF2 is essential for genomic stability in their SRSF2-knockout mouse model.
Train_Line_1270 The relationship between thrombosis and leukocytosis, thrombosis and JAK2V617F or pregnancy-associated complications and JAK2V617F have been examined by different groups of investigators with findings that were conflicting and inconclusive.
Train_Line_1271 In some of these patients, the mutated clone might have been too small to be detected with the current approaches.
Train_Line_1272 The difference in survival was attributed to an increased incidence of AML in patients treated with chlorambucil or radiophosphorus when compared with those treated with phlebotomy alone (13.2% vs. 9.6% vs. 1.5% over a period of 13-19 years).
Train_Line_1273 In the third family, we identified a 67-year-old male patient (case 6) diagnosed with MDS-RAEB-1 who harbored both canonical germline and somatic DDX41 mutations p.D140fs and p.R525H, respectively.
Train_Line_1274 Tipifarnib has been compared with best supportive care in older patients and was found not beneficial.
Train_Line_1275 Among the 435 patients with cytogenetic data for analysis, clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 44.4% of the MDS patients based on the FAB classification and in 44.2% of those based on the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_1276 Of the 30 patients harbouring mutations, 22 had poor risk and 8 had good risk IPSS cytogenetics.
Train_Line_1277 Multivariate analysis for AML transformation, including mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, ASXL1 (frameshift mutations), RUNX1, TP53, NRAS, and IDH1, as well as transfusion dependence and IPSS, demonstrated that the presence of SRSF2 but not U2AF1 mutations was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for AML transformation (SRSF2, HR = 2.83; 95% CI, 1.31-6.12; P = .008; Table 3; U2AF1, HR = 1.25; 95% CI, 0.36-4.33; P = .73; Table 3).
Train_Line_1278 The prognostic impact of mutations was evaluated in MDS patients for whom follow-up information was available (n = 154).
Train_Line_1279 Abbreviations: EPOR, erythropoietin receptor; ET, essential thrombocytosis; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GCSFR, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin; MF, myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia; MPD, myeloproliferative disorders; MPL, thrombopoietin receptor; PV, polycythemia vera; TPO, thrombopoietin.
Train_Line_1280 We used massively parallel sequencing to examine tumor samples collected from 87 patients with MDS before HSCT for coding mutations in 40 recurrently mutated MDS genes.
Train_Line_1281 These findings demonstrate that mutations are significantly associated with specific parameters that are used to calculate the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_1282 A subnormal serum Epo level in the absence of JAK2V617F mandates additional mutational analysis for JAK2 exon 12 mutation in order to capture some of the approximately 3% of PV patients who are JAK2V617F-negative.
Train_Line_1283 Founding or initiating driver mutation: A driver mutation that gives rise to the initial clone of a malignancy.
Train_Line_1284 Results were analyzed with CNAG (v.3.0) or Genotyping Console (Affymetrix).
Train_Line_1285 Table 4 Univariate and multivariable leukemia-free survival analysis of presenting clinical and laboratory features in 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_1286 Refractory disease was observed in 51% of CK+/TP53-altered compared with 35% of CK+/TP53-unaltered AMLs.
Train_Line_1287 NEW APPROACHES TO TREATMENT OF CANCERS DRIVEN BY MUTANT KIT.
Train_Line_1288 Pardanani et al studied a relatively large cohort of 61 patients with blast-phase MPN, and postulated that LNK mutations are more prevalent in the blast-phase (13.1%) than in the chronic phase (4.9%).
Train_Line_1289 Similarly this pathway appears to be critical in survival of GIST.
Train_Line_1290 Considering the loss-of-function feature of the SETD2 mutations identified, we further explored whether additional genetic and epigenetic mechanisms operate to inactivate SETD2 in acute leukemia (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11).
Train_Line_1291 The OS curve for patients with TP53 mutations is shown in Figure 2A.
Train_Line_1292 The JAK2 V617F mutation results in cytokine independent activation of JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) and extracellular signalrelated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways.
Train_Line_1293 Molecular associations of splice gene mutations in MDS.
Train_Line_1294 Normal karyotype was noted in all but one IDH1-mutated cases and 13 IDH2-mutated cases.
Train_Line_1295 NOTE. Variables considered for model inclusion were RAS mutation status (wild-type v mutated), WBC, spleen involvement, consolidation therapy group (HDAC v LDAC), and the RAS mutation-consolidation therapy interaction term.
Train_Line_1296 UPD was found by genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism analysis to occur in approximately 20% of AML cases.
Train_Line_1297 Figure 1. Seventy-one mutations in 55 of 355 persons were identified by NGS and mapped to the TET2 coding region. Mutations were identified that existed at >= 10% relative mutation abundance (RMA). These were mapped against TET2 translated exons 3-11 (NM.001127208; 2002 amino acids). Classification of mutations is indicated in the figure key and includes nonsense or insertion/deletion mutations (Indels), nonsynonymous amino acid changes, and splice-site mutations, indicated by orange, blue, and pink bars, respectively. Mutation level is also defined as > or <= 25% RMA, indicated by the solid or stippled bars, respectively. Regions conserved across the TET protein family, and implicated in the conversion of 5J methylcytosine to 5J methylhydroxycytosine (5-hmC), are shown (cons'd regions 1 and 2) and correspond to amino acids 1104-1478 and 1845-2002, respectively ([11] [18]).
Train_Line_1298 In addition, U2AF1 mutation was associated with shorter TTL in lower-risk MDS patients.
Train_Line_1299 4.5 Molecular genetics.
Train_Line_1300 Synonymous variants, noncoding variants more than 6 bases from splice junctions, or germline polymorphisms present in databases of normal genomes (dbSNP 132 or National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Exome Sequencing Project) at a population frequency >= 1% were discarded.
Train_Line_1301 The frameshift and nonsense mutations were not testable using this approach.
Train_Line_1302 Design and Methods.
Train_Line_1303 Co-targeting these pathways may lead to tumour control (or even eradication) while being well-tolerated by normal cells, a concept known as "synthetic lethality".
Train_Line_1304 The findings from these studies have been remarkably consistent.
Train_Line_1305 Analysis of the impact of BCOR disruptive mutations on the outcome of CN-AML (n = 160; German cohort) showed that BCOR-mutated patients had an inferior survival compared with the BCOR wild-type patients (n = 16 vs n = 144; alive at 2 years, 28.0% vs 66.3%; P = .024), and a trend for a worse event-free survival (n = 16 vs n = 144; event-free survival at 2 years, 12% vs 47.6%; P = .083).
Train_Line_1306 In the current cohort, U2AF1 mutation was detected in 7.5% of patients, a rate similar to prior reports (5.4-8.7%).
Train_Line_1307 Figure 3. p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del cause altered transactivation through target GATA2 response elements. p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del act as a loss-of-function alterations on GATA2 target promoter and enhancer elements. We cotransfected HEK293 cells with (i) GATA2-responsive CD34 (mut, CD34 enhancer with GATA binding sites mutated) (a) and RUNX1 (b) enhancer elements linked to a luciferase (LUC) reporter, and (ii) GATA2 (wild-type, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or p.Leu359Val) expression constructs or pCMV6-XL6 empty vector (EV). Similarly, we cotransfected Cos-7 cells using LYL1 promoter luciferase as a reporter (c). After 20 h, we harvested the cells, performed luciferase assays and plotted them as fold change (mean += s.e.m.) compared to the empty vector control. The pairwise comparisons are shown (*P < 0.05, for a,b and c n = 3). (d) p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del act as dominant negative alterations over wild-type GATA2. We cotransfected HEK293 cells with CD34 enhancer-luciferase reporter and equivalent mole ratios of wild-type to p.Thr354Met or p.Thr355del. After 20 h, we harvested the cells and performed luciferase assays. The pairwise comparisons are shown (*P < 0.05, n = 3; NS, not significant). (e) p.Thr354Met has reduced ability to co-activate the CSF1R (M-CSFR) promoter with PU.1. We cotransfected Cos-7 cells with CSF1R promoter-luciferase reporter, PU.1 expression construct and wild-type, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or p.Leu359Val expression constructs or empty vector. After 20 h, we performed luciferase assays and plotted them as fold change compared to empty vector. Pairwise comparisons are shown (*P < 0.05 compared to wild-type plus PU.1; **P < 0.05 compared to wild-type plus PU.1, but the results were not significant when compared to p.Thr354Met or p.Thr355del plus PU.1). In all comparisons, we used a Student's t-test.
Train_Line_1308 In addition, 26.7% (4 out of 15) of the SETD2-mutated patients carried two mutations on SETD2 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3).
Train_Line_1309 Next-generation sequencing of the TET2 gene in 355 MDS and CMML patients reveals low-abundance mutant clones with early origins, but indicates no definite prognostic value.
Train_Line_1310 Perhaps the most striking finding was the ability of bone marrow or spleen cells derived from MPLW515L animals, but not MPLWT, to grow in methylcellulose culture in the absence of any cytokines (Figure 6D and 6E).
Train_Line_1311 This might be explained by strong associations of variables (eg, TP53 mutations and IPSS risk score).
Train_Line_1312 Demographic and disease characteristics were compared between the 13 CMML FLT3-mutated patients and 289 FLT3-nonmutated patients (Table II).
Train_Line_1313 Concluding Remarks.
Train_Line_1314 Among patients with lower-risk MDS in this study, though patients with U2AF1 mutation had shorter TTL, they showed similar OS compared to those without this mutation, a finding also noted by Graubert et al.
Train_Line_1315 Because CALR mutations were strongly associated with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL, we analyzed samples from an additional 211 patients in these disease categories.
Train_Line_1316 Chromosome data were available in 452 patients at diagnosis, including 30 WT1-mutated and 422 WT1-wild patients (Table 3).
Train_Line_1317 They also had significantly longer disease duration and were more likely to have been treated with multiple drugs.
Train_Line_1318 TABLE I. MDS: FLT3-Mutated Versus FLT3-Nonmutated.
Train_Line_1319 When assessed, the level of SOCS3 methylation was low suggesting that SOCS3 methylation represents a secondary acquired change in IMF.
Train_Line_1320 Figure 1. The rates of U2AF1 mutation in different age groups.
Train_Line_1321 On the other hand, when JAK2V617F-transformed hematopoietic cell lines were used, it was reported that JAK2V617F mutant kinase escapes SOCS3-negative regulation by inducing hyperphosphorylation of the SOCS box, thereby blocking its interaction with Elongin C and stabilizing JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_1322 Recent studies demonstrate that C/EBPalpha indeed acts as a bona fide tumor suppressor in a number of tumor types, supporting the view that disruption of normal differentiation and its uncoupling from cell cycle arrest are key components in the development of cancer.
Train_Line_1323 We performed mutational analysis on diagnostic samples obtained from patients in the ECOG E1900 trial.
Train_Line_1324 Fig 3. CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) mutations and their effect on prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (A) and (B) Mutations of the coding sequence of C/EBPalpha have been described in approximately 15% of patients with AML and a normal karyotype by conventional cytogenetics. Two thirds of these patients harbor N-terminal frameshift mutations and C-terminal in-frame insertion/deletion mutations, leading to a nonfunctional 20 kD isoform and increased 30 kD isoform expressed from the N-terminally mutated allele as well as a dysfunctional 42 kD isoform expressed from the C-terminally mutated allele (ie, patient 2"). Please see Pabst et al2 for more details. (C) Retrospective survival analysis of patients with AML harboring C/EBPalpha mutations or no C/EBPalpha mutations showing superior overall survival of patients with C/EBPalpha mutations. Data from Preudhomme et al. NJab, antibody recognizing N-terminal portion; TAD, transactivation domain; C'ab, antibody recongnizing the C-terminal domain; bZip, basic zipper region; wt, wild type.
Train_Line_1325 All cases included in this cohort presented with marked variability of megakaryocyte size ranging from small MDS-like forms with hypolobulated nuclei and disperse chromatin (Figures 1C, F; 2 C, H) to large more MPD-like cells with hyperlobulated nuclei (Figures 1D; E, G, H; 2D, I).
Train_Line_1326 They are not associated with a specific MPN or MDS subtype but might be more frequent in MPD/MPNs and are associated with poor prognosis.
Train_Line_1327 The number of burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) was accessed after 10- to 14-day culture at 37--degrees--C in humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2, as per the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_1328 The SH2 domain of LNK is known to bind JAK2 and do a critical role in negative regulation of the downstream signal transduction.
Train_Line_1329 TET gene expression was analyzed using probes from the Universal Probe Library (Roche) and primers specific for TET1 (NM_030625.2), TET2 var 1 (NM_017628.3), TET2 var 2 (NM_001127208.1), and TET3 (NM_144993.1), as detailed in supplemental Table 2B.
Train_Line_1330 The outcome for patients assigned to category 3 is similar to the published median survival of patients with intermediate-2 IPSS risk MDS, indicating that these patients should be considered for therapies commonly reserved for higher-risk MDS.
Train_Line_1331 There is growing evidence that AML with a favorable genetic profile, that is, CBF AML and AML with mutated NPM1 (with or without FLT3-ITD), may benefit from dose escalation during consolidation.
Train_Line_1332 JAK2 exon 12 mutations are rare in ET or PMF.
Train_Line_1333 DESIGN AND METHODS.
Train_Line_1334 The prognostic impact of splice gene mutations was evaluated in MDS patients for whom follow-up information was available (n = 198).
Train_Line_1335 Before the advent of modern genetic and genomic tools to study malignancies, William Dameshek suggested that the various MPNs might result from an "undiscovered stimulus".
Train_Line_1336 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to address the association of IDH mutations with other genetic alterations in MDS.
Train_Line_1337 To examine the prevalence of TET2 mutations and, especially, lower abundance TET2 mutant clones, we used ultrasensitive "454-deep sequencing" to investigate the integrity of the TET2 gene in a well-characterized cohort of 355 de novo MDS and CMML patients.
Train_Line_1338 Of note, absolute leukocytosis in both the JAK2V617F and the MPLW515L-mediated BMT models is higher than is typically observed in human PV and MF, respectively.
Train_Line_1339 This study formally proved that almost all cells of the bone marrow myeloid cell lines (ie, immature red cells, granulocytic/monocytic precursors, and megakaryocytes) are clonally derived in MDS patients at any stage of the disease and not only after AML transformation.
Train_Line_1340 If we perform the expression study for the production of truncated protein or no protein synthesis by this mutation, it would be more helpful to understand its effect to LNK function.
Train_Line_1341 Spliceosome aberrations have also been described in solid tumors, examples being recurrent somatic mutations of U2AF35 in adenocarcinoma of the lung, and overexpression of SRSF1 and SRSF2 in both adeno and squamous cell lung cancers.
Train_Line_1342 Because RUNX1 mutations play a role in CN-AML, we further investigated their relationship with BCOR mutations among CN-AML patients without NPM1 mutations (n = 104).
Train_Line_1343 The mutations were in the genes UIMC1, FAM175A and BABAM1.
Train_Line_1344 Number of patients (% among the males or females).
Train_Line_1345 We then classified patients with intermediate-risk AML who had wild-type FLT3-ITD into three categories, with marked differences in the 3-year rate of overall survival (adjusted P<0.001): patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations and NPM1 mutations (overall survival, 89%); patients with TET2, ASXL1, PHF6, or MLL-PTD mutations (overall survival, 6.3%); and patients with wild-type TET2, ASXL1, PHF6, and MLL-PTD, without co-occurring IDH or NPM1 mutations (overall survival, 46.2%) (Fig. 2A).
Train_Line_1346 Mapping on the human genome assembly hg18/NCBI36.1 was performed using MAQ Version 0.7.1 software (http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-man.shtml), accepting up to 2 mismatches in the first 24 bases (seed) and considering a maximum insert size of 600 bp.
Train_Line_1347 All three disorders are characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation but their disease-causing mutations remain unidentified despite a plethora of mutations described beginning in 2005.
Train_Line_1348 Oh et al(2010a) recently showed that thrombopoietin-dependent growth, as well as STAT5 phosphorylation of BaF3 cells that stably expressed MPL, was less inhibited by the SH2B3 EQ mutant while a deletion mutant lacking both SH2B3 SH2 and PH domains completely lost the SH2B3 inhibitory effect.
Train_Line_1349 CBL mutations are found in several myeloid neoplasms, particularly in the MDS/MPN subtype chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML; Sanada et al 2009).
Train_Line_1350 In human MPN, three studies about LNK mutations have been reported, in which 12 of 102 patients were shown to harbor 14 different LNK mutations.
Train_Line_1351 IDH mutations result in production of 2-hydroxyglutarate, which can inhibit a-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes, including the TET family of enzymes and the Jumonji family of histone lysine demethylases causing aberrant DNA and histone hypermethylation and impaired hematopoietc stem cell differentiation.
Train_Line_1352 Moreover, the unexpected adverse effects and possible mechanisms of resistance to these promising therapies are currently unknown.
Train_Line_1353 It is now well established that IFN-a can control erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis in the majority patients with PV or ET (usual dose is 3 million units SC three times-a-week).
Train_Line_1354 Interestingly, the authors of the particular study did not find IDH2 mutations in their study cohort.
Train_Line_1355 For germ-line controls, DNA was obtained from paired CD3+ T cells.
Train_Line_1356 The characteristics of the AML index patient subjected to WES are described in "Results." WES was approved by the ethics committee at the University of Perugia, Italy.
Train_Line_1357 FLT3 mutational analysis was performed on 1,232 (58%) of the MDS patients and 302 (65%) of the CMML patients.
Train_Line_1358 The close relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms has been confirmed in all subsequent studies.
Train_Line_1359 Randomized trials evaluating the addition of GO to conventional chemotherapy have been completed (eg, MRC AML 15 trial; final results are pending) or are ongoing (eg, SWOG Protocol S0106; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00085709).
Train_Line_1360 In addition, the MPLW515L murine bone marrow transplant model shares some phenotypic characteristics with other murine models of MF, including that induced by overexpression of thrombopoietin, either in transgenic or in bone marrow transplant models, and in the transgenic GATA-1low mouse, though the severity and chronicity of the MF phenotype varies in these different models, which, unlike the current model, are not based on somatic disease alleles observed in human MF.
Train_Line_1361 Recent studies have performed a systematic analysis of panels of known or putative genes relevant in myelodysplasia by coupling high-throughput sample handling with massive parallel sequencing, or by combining deep sequencing with array-based genomic hybridization (Seishi Ogawa, Kyoto University, personal communication, August 9, 2013).
Train_Line_1362 In other words, the ASXL1 mutation coincided with mutations of genes involved in the signal transduction pathway (JAK2 and NRAS), transcription factor (RUNX1), epigenetic modification (IDH and EZH2) or splicing machinery (SRSF2) in MDS patients.
Train_Line_1363 RSs were observed in one single SRSF2-mut patient, and this case was the only one with a concomitant SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_1364 The primer pair for exon2 was: U2AF1_exon2F: AAG CGG CCG CAG TCG ATC ACC TGC CTC ACT /U2AF1_exon2R: AAG CGG CCG CGG AGG TGC TTA ATA CCA CGG as that designed by Yoshida et al.
Train_Line_1365 7/12 (58%) of patients with a DNMT3A mutation progressed to AML, compared to 39/138 (28%) of patients without a mutation (Figure 2C, log-rank p=0.007).
Train_Line_1366 Granulocytes from JAK2 V617F-positive IMF patients showed a higher SOCS3 transcript level than did those from JAK2 V617F-negative patients but a similar level to granulocytes from normal individuals (Figure 3C).
Train_Line_1367 In MDSs, ASXL1 mutations are associated with a reduced time to progression in AML and constitute an independent prognostic marker.
Train_Line_1368 Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to dissect the individual impacts of prognostic factors of OS.
Train_Line_1369 The presence of ASXL1 mutations predicted shorter survival, especially in the patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_1370 ITD indicates internal tandem duplication; and TKD, tyrosine kinase domain.
Train_Line_1371 In multivariate analysis including established risk factors, SF3B1 mutations were found to be independently associated with better overall survival (hazard ratio=.15, P=025) and lower risk of evolution into AML (hazard ratio=.33, P=049).
Train_Line_1372 For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for OS and time to progression to AML, adjusting for potential confounding covariates.
Train_Line_1373 Patients with intermediate-risk AML who had both NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had an improved 3-year rate of overall survival, as compared with patients who had mutant NPM1 and both wild-type IDH1 and wild-type IDH2 (89% vs. 31%, P<0.001) (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_1374 Somatic DDX41 mutations are possibly hypomorphic, based on the location in the ATP binding domain.
Train_Line_1375 Multivariable analysis revealed an interaction of cytarabine dose and RAS status (P = .06).
Train_Line_1376 OS was calculated from date of transplantation to date of death, and surviving patients were censored at the date on which they were last known to be alive.
Train_Line_1377 They decoded the DNA sequence of three genes that are known to be involved in how blood cells develop for 45 patients with MF.
Train_Line_1378 Details of the treatment protocols have been previously reported.
Train_Line_1379 Abnormal and clonal hematopoiesis resulting in peripheral blood cytopenias, and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are the main characteristics of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Train_Line_1380 Although whole genome sequencing is clearly more informative, massive parallel sequencing of a panel of myeloid genes is more feasible in a clinical laboratory.
Train_Line_1381 Histopathological studies in erythromelalgia have revealed platelet-rich arteriolar microthrombi with endothelial inflammation and intimal proliferation accompanied by increased platelet consumption that is coupled with abundant VW factor deposition.
Train_Line_1382 Data from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche d'Adulto (GIMEMA) AML-10 trial and from 3 consecutive trials of the HOVON-SAKK group with a larger number of patients demonstrate a benefit for allogeneic HSCT, among younger patients with adverse cytogenetics.
Train_Line_1383 Therefore, at least in the 5 patients we investigated, BCOR mutations were associated with the absence of full-length BCOR and lack or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein.
Train_Line_1384 However, the aforementioned studies did not further investigate somatic DDX41 mutations.
Train_Line_1385 Interestingly, in our analysis, point mutations in codon S34 were less frequent than mutations in codon Q157, whereas Graubert et al found more mutations in codon S34.
Train_Line_1386 In total, 99 mutations affecting one of the 4 genes were detected in 95 patients (42.2%).
Train_Line_1387 Table 4. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) for the overall survival in all patients (N1/4466).
Train_Line_1388 In fact, in our cohort, there was no significant difference in BRCC3 expression between males and females (Online Supplementary Figure S2).
Train_Line_1389 As a rescue experiment, flow cytometry analysis showed higher expression of the CD11b and CD14 differentiation marker in U937 cells with forced expression of DDX41 (Figure S5G).
Train_Line_1390 Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2012 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management.
Train_Line_1391 13.3 Transfusion support.
Train_Line_1392 TP53-altered CK-AMLs had a higher degree of genomic complexity as measured by total number of aberrations (>= 5 aberrations, P < .0001) and the presence of marker chromosomes (P = .0005).
Train_Line_1393 On the other hand, extreme thrombocytosis neither defines high-risk disease nor warrants the use of cytoreductive therapy.
Train_Line_1394 The former mutation is consistent with homozygosity, whereas the latter would have had to have been acquired after the recombination event.
Train_Line_1395 In univariate analysis, SF3B1 mutation positively affected OS (HR = 0.35, 95% CI, 0.17-0.72, P = .009).
Train_Line_1396 There is a lack of prospective controlled studies evaluating different treatments in relapsed AML, and therefore no generally established standard.
Train_Line_1397 In a landmark study, Walter et al used whole genome sequencing to identify somatic mutations in bone marrow samples from patients with AML developing from MDS and then genotyped in each patient a bone marrow sample obtained during the antecedent MDS phase.

Train_Line_1399 The pathogenesis of MDS has not been clearly identified; genomic damage with accumulation of genetic aberrations, deregulated or autoreactive immune responses, and abnormal bone marrow (BM) microenvironment might all contribute to the development and progression of this preleukemic disease.
Train_Line_1400 Sh2b3 KO mice exhibit a MPN-like phenotype, while Sh2b3 heterozygous mice have an intermediate phenotype (Velazquez et al 2002), further supporting the haploinsufficiency model.
Train_Line_1401 A similar clonal architecture has been more recently observed also in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
Train_Line_1402 The significant value of SF3B1 mutation was retained in a multivariate analysis, including age, sex, hemoglobin level, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, cytogenetic risk, bone marrow blasts, and ring sideroblasts (HR = 0.15, 95% CI, 0.03-0.78, P = .025).
Train_Line_1403 The median follow-up for patients was 4.5 years (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.30 years).
Train_Line_1404 A dual lentiviral vector system was used to generate HL-60 cells expressing wild-type or mutant GATA2 upon addition of 4HT.
Train_Line_1405 Both are equally effective.
Train_Line_1406 Our mutational analysis, together with in vivo and in vitro functional assays, demonstrates that loss of function of SETD2 is a critical event in facilitating both disease initiation and progression through decreased H3K36me3 in leukemias characterized by MLL fusion, MLL-PTD or AML1-ETO.
Train_Line_1407 In patient n. 244, the allelic ratio at initial diagnosis was 10%T with a platelet count of 433x109/L, thus meeting the diagnostic criteria of RARS, but not of RARS-T.
Train_Line_1408 The LR-PSS divides patients into three risk categories instead of the two IPSS lower-risk categories, allowing for greater stratification between those in the highest- and lowest-risk groups.
Train_Line_1409 RESULTS.
Train_Line_1410 However, the clinical and biologic characteristics of MDS with this mutation remain to be addressed.
Train_Line_1411 Lentiviral infections were performed twice by spinoculation.
Train_Line_1412 ASXL1.
Train_Line_1413 The early genetic lesions that lead to clonal hematopoiesis in MDS remain poorly understood, with a low frequency of point mutations in genes, such as TP53 (5%-10%), RUNX1 (2-10%), NRAS (10%-15%), and FLT3 (2%-5%).
Train_Line_1414 However, no significant prognostic effect was found when analyzing the influence of DNMT3A mutations in NPM1/FLT3 low-risk patients (OS, HR = 1.13, 95% CI, 0.57 to 2.23, P = .72; RFS, HR = 0.8; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.64, P = .54, Figs 2E and 2F; CR, 81% v 89%, respectively, P = .26).
Train_Line_1415 The mutations in CALR that were observed in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms lead to the expression of a protein that lacks an endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence; it is not clear how this results in increased STAT signaling or how the CALR mutations lead to a clonal advantage in hematopoietic cells.
Train_Line_1416 Time to progression (TTP) was the time from diagnosis to progression to AML by WHO criteria (i.e., 20% blasts).
Train_Line_1417 SOCS3 expression data for granulocytes and/or mononuclear cells were available for 30 patients in whom methylation status had been assessed (11 methylated; 19 unmethylated).
Train_Line_1418 While significant progress has been made in revealing cytogenetic and molecular changes in AML less is known about the molecular changes that can lead to MDS.
Train_Line_1419 This contention was confirmed by the most recent study from the European collaboration study on lowdose aspirin in polycythemia (ECLAP).
Train_Line_1420 Among the 9 patients with mutations treated with 5-azacitidine, all retained the same mutation at sequential time points but with variable decrease in the mutant allele burden in patients responding to therapy (Table III).
Train_Line_1421 A number of possible explanations exist for the different phenotypes of JAK2 V617F-positive MPD patients; transformation of different progenitor cells, inherited genetic differences and additional, acquired genetic or epigenetic modifications.
Train_Line_1422 Survival probabilities were estimated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared between patients with a mutation and those without mutant alleles by means of the logrank test.
Train_Line_1423 The vast majority of recommendations were category 2A recommendations, that is, they are based on low-level evidence and there is uniform panel consensus.
Train_Line_1424 Relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_1425 Microarray data will be available at gene expression omnibus at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/(GEO accession number GSE34542).
Train_Line_1426 Autoimmune processes have been shown to contribute to cytopenia in a subset of MDS patients, and these patients may benefit from immunosuppressive treatment.
Train_Line_1427 Nevertheless, alloimmunization remains a major obstacle to effective transfusion due to antibodies to HLA class I antigens in many women with prior pregnancies or patients with prior transfusions.
Train_Line_1428 Also, in BCR-ABL1-positive leukemias, the differential diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis should be considered.
Train_Line_1429 The prognostic impact of these mutations in myeloid neoplasms remains to be elucidated.
Train_Line_1430 In addition, 155 somatic aberrations were identified in 41 patients (supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_1431 Cells were gated for viability (using forward/side scatter and 7AAD) and GFP positivity, and 10,000 events were analyzed from this subset for marker expression.
Train_Line_1432 The International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) stratifies MDS patients into 4 risk groups by percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, type of cytogenetic abnormality, and number and degree of cytopenias at presentation.
Train_Line_1433 The relevance of SOCS1 exon 2 CpG island methylation for leukemogenesis in general and for the pathogenesis of the MPD in particular is, therefore, unclear and should be considered with caution.
Train_Line_1434 A founding malignant clone that has undergone subclonal evolution is no longer monoclonal in the strict sense, but is instead a mosaic of several clones/genomes with different sets of somatic mutations.
Train_Line_1435 Patients without mutations in these genes have relatively good OS and PFS and could potentially be prioritized for HSCT.
Train_Line_1436 Graubert et al and Thol et al have found suggestive evidence of an increased risk of progression to secondary AML associated with this mutation, but the similar result was not identified by Damm et al.
Train_Line_1437 WT1 mutations disappeared at complete remission in all WT1-mutated patients studied.
Train_Line_1438 A mutation hot spot at amino acid R882 occurred in 4 MDS samples and is located in the methyltransferase domain of the protein.
Train_Line_1439 Four of 12 patients harboring heterozygous point mutations shared the point mutation GAG>GAT in codon 1103, leading to a glutamic to aspartic acid substitution.
Train_Line_1440 As expected, primary myelofibrosis was associated with shorter overall survival, as compared with essential thrombocythemia (hazard ratio for death, 7.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.9 to 10.2; P<0.001).
Train_Line_1441 The median follow-up of patients alive was 33.0 months by February 2013.
Train_Line_1442 Time to AML progression was measured from the date of MDS diagnosis to the time of AML diagnosis.
Train_Line_1443 Our prognostic finding in MDS is in accordance with findings in AML and CMML, in which ASXL1 mutations are also associated with an unfavorable outcome.
Train_Line_1444 Pretreatment samples from all patients were studied centrally by G- and R-banding analysis.
Train_Line_1445 PKC412 is a good inhibitor of D816 mutant KIT and was shown to have activity in one SM patient.
Train_Line_1446 However, the incomplete penetrance and the increased frequency of myeloid disorders at older age may have hindered the identification of more inherited leukemia syndromes in older adults.
Train_Line_1447 The RAS/MAPK pathway is deregulated in JMML due to mutations in NRAS, KRAS2 or NF1 in approximately 40% of cases.
Train_Line_1448 The methylation level was low (<1%) in ten patients but was significant (>10%) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patient MF10 (Figure 2D).
Train_Line_1449 Postnatal excision of C/EBPalpha is feasible in these inducible mice, allowing the study of the effects of C/EBPalpha downregulation in predisposing to lung tumorigenesis.
Train_Line_1450 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze OS by the log-rank test.
Train_Line_1451 Data presented here indicate that the subset of JAK2V617F-negative MF patients with the MPLW515L mutation will also be sensitive to inhibition with small molecule JAK2 inhibitors.
Train_Line_1452 Again, this study unexpectedly revealed novel pathway mutations involving multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including U2AF1, ZRSR2, SRSF2, and SF3B1.
Train_Line_1453 Figure 1 shows the frequency of somatic mutations in the entire cohort and the interrelationships among the various mutations, as represented visually with the use of a Circos plot.
Train_Line_1454 There was no significant difference in OS between patients with or without TET2 mutations (median OS: 30.0 months; 95% CI: 14.5-45.5 vs 36.0 months; 95% CI: 28.0-44.0.7; P = .37; Figure 6).
Train_Line_1455 With this information, we validated the LR-PSS in an independent cohort of patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_1456 Sixty-four (28%) of the study patients had 1% RS, with 41% of these having 15% RS.
Train_Line_1457 The analysis of the methylation status of the CpG islands within the promoter and exon 2 of SOCS1 and/or within the promoter of SOCS3 was conducted on a total of 100 patients (15 with PV, 25 with ET and 60 with MF).
Train_Line_1458 In MDSs, ASXL1 mutations are often associated with RUNX1 mutations, and, in AMLs, with RUNX1 and CEBPA.
Train_Line_1459 Whether there is a true difference in WT1 mutation pattern between childhood and adult AML and its significance needs to be clarified by further studies.
Train_Line_1460 Type and site of TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_1461 Validation of the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_1462 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_1463 For pedigrees 1 and 3 (refs. 11,12), the presentation varied, with some members showing protracted MDS and others showing acute onset; the French-American-British (FAB)-classified subtype and karyotypic features of AML varied.
Train_Line_1464 Data presented at the 2012 American Society of Hematology meeting reported that in vitro treatment with IDH inhibitors reverses hypermethylation of DNA as well as histones, and in vivo use lowers 2-HG by >90% in xenograft models.
Train_Line_1465 Significantly higher incidences of FLT3/ITD and CEBPA mutation in patients with WT1 mutations were reported by some researchers, but not others.
Train_Line_1466 Nine mutations were found at <= 25% RMA in 8 patients (Table 2; Figure 1).
Train_Line_1467 An unpaired t test was used to derive the significance of the difference between the mean values.
Train_Line_1468 Coupled with the standardized international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), mutations in these five genes could help refine the prognosis evaluation of MDSs.
Train_Line_1469 None of the other 16 genes analysed were mutated in TP53 mutants.
Train_Line_1470 The progression in the allelic ratio from low heterozygous to high homozygous JAK2V617F was paralleled by an increasing thrombocytosis in both JAK2V617F positive patients from whom sequential biopsies were available.
Train_Line_1471 We detected increased phosphorylation of STAT5 in the absence of interleukin-3 in the type 1 mutation of CALR and at an interleukin-3 concentration of 0.1 ng per milliliter (Fig. 5C).
Train_Line_1472 HR > 1 indicates an increased risk of an event for the first category listed.
Train_Line_1473 In AML KIT mutation is relatively uncommon and is confined to Core Binding Factor (CBF) leukaemias which comprise around 17% of AML and are characterised by t(8;21) or inv(16).
Train_Line_1474 Several familial leukemia syndromes have been identified (Owen et al, 2008; Hahn et al, 2011; Liew and Owen, 2011).
Train_Line_1475 In addition, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrated for the first time the distinct association of SRSF2 mutation with male sex; older age; and mutations of RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1 genes.
Train_Line_1476 Additionally, the L576 sidechain makes hydrophobic contacts with the aC helix (V643, Y646).
Train_Line_1477 Eleven patients had no aberration on chromosome 17p but had TP53 mutant allele burden ranging between 6 and 47% (i.e. suggestive of heterozygous mutations) and conversely, three patients had deletion of 17p but no TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_1478 In addition, disruption of protein-protein binding interactions has been a recurrent challenge in drug development.
Train_Line_1479 ZRSR2-mut patients mainly clustered into the IPSS intermediate-1 and intermediate-2 risk groups (84% vs 49% in ZRSR2-wt patients; P = .017).
Train_Line_1480 We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort.
Train_Line_1481 In PV patients, I prefer a hematocrit target of 45%.
Train_Line_1482 However, shRNA transductions were applied for Brcc3 knockdown with a single targeting sequence.
Train_Line_1483 Among the remaining 30 patients, the same mutations were retained in 29 patients during follow-ups (Table 3) but could not be detected by direct sequencing in one patient at the time of disease progression (patient 1).
Train_Line_1484 SRSF2 mutations were associated with RUNX1 (P < .001) and (P = .013) mutations, whereas U2AF1 mutations were associated with ASXL1 (P = .005) and DNMT3A (P = .004) mutations.
Train_Line_1485 Another study reported findings suggesting that SF3B1 or Sf3b1 haploinsufficiency leads to ring sideroblast formation in human cells or heterozygous knockout mice, respectively.
Train_Line_1486 The categories of evidence and consensus were those used by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN; www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/PDF/aml.pdf).
Train_Line_1487 This function is shared with the 2 other TET proteins known in mammals, TET1 and TET3.
Train_Line_1488 Products were purified after both rounds of PCR and 1 uL of the product from first PCR was used as template for the second round.
Train_Line_1489 Recently, Jost et al. reported methylation of SOCS1 in 15% of MPD patients.
Train_Line_1490 The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Boston (Massachusetts, United States) Children's Hospital Animal Care and Use Committee.
Train_Line_1491 Similarly, for IMF, SOCS3 transcript levels were higher among JAK2 V617F-positive patients than among JAK2 V617F-negative cases.
Train_Line_1492 To further define the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Train_Line_1493 Immunophenotyping is required to establish the diagnosis of AML with minimal differentiation, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage.
Train_Line_1494 DNA from 50 healthy blood donors (age, 18-60 years) was obtained from the Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School (Hannover, Germany).
Train_Line_1495 Risk stratification based on the MDAPS was; 1 (8%) high risk, 3 (23%) intermediate-2 risk, 3 (23%) intermediate-1 risk, and 6 (46%) low risk.
Train_Line_1496 ASXL1 mutation was shown to predict poor outcome in WHO-defined MDS and CMML patients, and was associated with a reduced time to AML transformation.
Train_Line_1497 WT SH2B3 significantly inhibited colony formation compared to a vector control when reintroduced in Sh2b3 knock-out (KO) BM.
Train_Line_1498 All 4 BCOR-mut CMML patients were classified as CMML-2 disease type at diagnosis (P = .047; supplemental Table 3).
Train_Line_1499 New mutations and pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_1500 The results significantly favored treatment with phlebotomy alone with a median survival of 12.6 years compared with 10.9 and 9.1 years for treatment with radiophosphorus and chlorambucil, respectively.
Train_Line_1501 RESULTS.
Train_Line_1502 Baseline clinical characteristics from our cohort of 87 patients who underwent HSCT for MDS at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute are listed in Table 1.
Train_Line_1503 Mutation or methylation of other components of JAK/STAT signaling, such as the negative regulators suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SOCS3, may contribute to the pathogenesis of both JAK2 V617F positive and negative myeloproliferative disorders.
Train_Line_1504 Increased knowledge about molecular lesions underlying CN-AML has greatly improved our capability to stratify CN-AML patients into prognostic risk groups and to monitor minimal residual disease, thus influencing therapeutic decisions.
Train_Line_1505 All showed a conversion of CGG to CAG leading to an arginine to glutamine substitution.
Train_Line_1506 After 48 h, HL-60GEV cells were selected in 1 mg/ml hygromycin (Roche).
Train_Line_1507 A similar evolutionary process likely operates in CMML and aCML, which may develop from a preexisting MDS through the acquisition of subclonal driver mutations that cause monocytosis and granulocytic leukocytosis, respectively.
Train_Line_1508 We then performed deep-sequencing analyses of all exons of BCOR, DNMT3A, YY2, and SSRP1 in an initial set of 30 AMLs that showed the same genetic characteristics of our AML index patient.
Train_Line_1509 Consideration of several host factors, disease features, and donor qualities can help in this determination, but uncertainty persists.
Train_Line_1510 Lesions of 17p detected by SNP-A were more frequent in patients carrying a single rather than double TP53 clones (7/11 vs. 3/10, P < 0.2).
Train_Line_1511 We previously characterized a cohort of 439 clinically annotated samples from patients with MDS for mutations in 18 genes.
Train_Line_1512 The overall median value was 39.5% (range, 5.4%-70.3%), and frequencies of observations are reported in Figure 1.
Train_Line_1513 The World Health Organization (WHO) classification criteria for MDS diagnosis require evaluation of peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology combined with cytogenetic analyses, and define the following categories: refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) type 1 (RAEB-1) and type 2 (RAEB-2), and myelodysplastic syndrome with isolated (del 5q) [MDS del(5q)].
Train_Line_1514 In MDS, the clinical significance of DNMT3A mutations is less clear but also seems to be unfavorable, whereas TET2 mutations are not associated with survival.
Train_Line_1515 Several active and inactive conformations of KIT, like other RTKs, are believed to exist in equilibrium such that in the absence of ligand the inactive conformations are predominant and the receptor has very low basal activity.
Train_Line_1516 Furthermore, a small molecule JAK kinase inhibitor inhibited MPLW515L-mediated proliferation and JAK-STAT signaling in vitro.
Train_Line_1517 Allogeneic HSCT is the preferred consolidation therapy once a new remission has been attained.
Train_Line_1518 Abnormalities of mRNA splicing and human disease.
Train_Line_1519 We detected the JAK2V617F mutation in 11/23 of the RARS-T patients (48%) with a predominance of females (8/11 positive patients).
Train_Line_1520 Hence JMD mutations such as V560G enhance imatinib inhibition and clinical responses.
Train_Line_1521 For validation of the effect, we showed the successful reduction of Brcc3 protein amount by immunoblot to confirm the suppressive effects of shRNA.
Train_Line_1522 Next-generation sequencing may help establish whether a large fraction of ET and PV at diagnosis is the consequence of a single genetic event.
Train_Line_1523 We have previously demonstrated a role for the SH2B3 PH domain in plasma membrane localization (Gery et al 2007).
Train_Line_1524 The report concerning interaction of ASXL1 mutation with other genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of MDS and its progression is very limited.
Train_Line_1525 In univariable analysis, TP53 alteration also predicted for inferior OS; median survival times for CK+/TP53-altered and CK+/TP53-unaltered patients were 4.14 and 10.97 months, respectively.
Train_Line_1526 The mechanism of how altered C/EBPalpha function ultimately leads to neoplasia may be through failure to induce differentiation in progenitor cells leading to a prolonged and aberrant proliferation phase in these cells followed by random accumulation of additional genetic events and full transformation.
Train_Line_1527 In ET, the presence of JAK2V617F has been associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis and a lower risk of post-ET MF.
Train_Line_1528 SOCS3 expression was only moderately raised in the granulocytes from JAK2 V617F-positive ET patients (p=0.048) while it was similar to normal levels in JAK2 V617F-negative ET patients (Figure 3B).
Train_Line_1529 This is independent of the alteration of general gene expression and derives from an abnormal interaction with the polycomb group proteins that are responsible for the stable repression of Hox genes.
Train_Line_1530 We confirmed that these mutations were mutually exclusive.
Train_Line_1531 Favorable-risk AML.
Train_Line_1532 Mutations found at <= 10% RMA were validated in 2 additional independent PCR and GS FLX sequencing experiments, giving a combined coverage of > 800X.
Train_Line_1533 Finally, BCOR mutations tended to be associated with an inferior outcome in a cohort of 422 CN-AML patients (25.6% vs 56.7% overall survival at 2 years; P=.032).
Train_Line_1534 There is evidence that constitutive signaling by JAK2V61F requires the homodimeric receptor, explaining why the JAK2V617F-induced proliferation affects 3 myeloid lineages.
Train_Line_1535 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_1536 There is a growing list of genetic abnormalities that are being investigated (Table 3).
Train_Line_1537 DNA Sequencing.
Train_Line_1538 To address this issue, we extended the analysis of BCOR mutations performed in the first cohort of 30 patients (see "Identification of recurrent BCOR mutations in AML") to an additional 51 CN-AML patients (n = 82 samples, including the index patient) that were selected for carrying the same genetic features as the AML index patient.
Train_Line_1539 A recent independent report describes similar proportions of mutated patients: 19 of 23 (82.6%) cases of RARS and 39 of 53 (73.6%) cases of RCMD-RS.
Train_Line_1540 In particular, SETBP1 mutations are found in ~25% to 30% of patients with aCML.
Train_Line_1541 In the hematopoietic system, the interplay between C/EBPalpha and GATA factors is a similar example while in the lung, the tissue-specific regulatory network includes thyroid transcription factor-1, FoxA2 (also called HNF3beta), and C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_1542 Hypermethylation of SOCS3 represents another acquired aberration affecting one component of a signaling pathway within JAK2 V617F-negative cases of IMF.
Train_Line_1543 However, in AML cells, R882 mutations always occur with retention of the wild-type allele, suggesting the R882 mutant can serve either as a dominant-negative regulator of wild-type DNMT3A or may result in acquisition of an undefined, neomorphic enzymatic activity.
Train_Line_1544 The exact mechanism for SH2B3 inhibitory activity is not known; however, this effect appears to require direct contact between SH2B3 and its target.
Train_Line_1545 The knockdown of PRMT5 increases colony formation and erythroid differentiation of primary cells.
Train_Line_1546 We conducted a retrospective review at MDACC to identify the incidence, prognostic, and predictive impact of FLT3 mutations (ITD and TKD) in patients with MDS (per WHO classification) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
Train_Line_1547 While the majority of AML patients achieve remission with aggressive chemotherapy, relatively few survive long-term, so that new treatments are urgently needed.
Train_Line_1548 BM immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Train_Line_1549 In some patients, the order of genetic changes, i.e., the temporal order of acquisition of driver mutations, can be inferred by means of massive parallel sequencing though calculation of the mutant allele burden or variant allele frequency (VAF).
Train_Line_1550 Transfections.
Train_Line_1551 Although therapy with HDAC resulted in a lower CIR both in patients with and without RAS mutations, its benefit was much more pronounced in patients with mutated RAS.
Train_Line_1552 The last four amino acids of calreticulin (KDEL) contain the endoplasmic reticulum-retention signal.
Train_Line_1553 Because survival in strictly WHO-defined ET is near-normal (15-year survival of ~80%) and the 10-year risk of AML or MF less than 1%, it would be inappropriate to suggest that any current treatment modifies the natural history of the disease.
Train_Line_1554 This standardized report includes data from cytogenetic analysis and from mutation analyses of the NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 genes.
Train_Line_1555 To assess the prevalence of the MPLW515L allele in the general population, we genotyped a standard panel of 270 samples collected by the International HapMap Consortium.
Train_Line_1556 For example, Schnittger et al reported that no survival impact was observed in their larger CMML cohort; Makishima et al also reported that SRSF2 mutations did not affect outcomes in CMML patients.
Train_Line_1557 Recently, through next-generation whole exome sequencing, recurrent somatic mutations involving the RNA splicing machinery were identified in a substantial proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a myeloid hematopoietic disorder characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and risk of transformation to acute leukemia.
Train_Line_1558 Purpose.
Train_Line_1559 To the best of our knowledge, we have performed the first multivariable analysis to include DNMT3A, SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1 mutations and have shown how consideration of mutation status might influence the prediction of prognosis in both the IPSS and the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_1560 In contrast, overexpression of WT DDX41 in U937 cells led to decreased exon skipping of ZMYM2 in comparison to mock transduction (Figure 6D; Figures S7B and S7C).
Train_Line_1561 Approximately one-fourth of patients with ring sideroblasts (RARS, RCMD-RS, and RARS-T subgroups) had a wild-type SF3B1.
Train_Line_1562 Of patients with poor risk IPSS cytogenetics, 33% (22 of 67) had TP53 mutation.
Train_Line_1563 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are myeloid neoplasms (MPN) characterized by dysplasia in one or more cell lines, ineffective hematopoiesis, and variable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_1564 Variables collected on all patients (FLT3 mutated and FLT3 nonmutated) at diagnosis included the following: age, gender, performance status, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count, hemoglobin, bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype, and history of a prior malignancy.
Train_Line_1565 The most striking involvement of KIT is in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) which are derived from the ICC.
Train_Line_1566 Conversely, the observation that most mutations in PTPN11 associated with Noonan syndrome, which are sufficient to perturb developmental processes, are not fully leukemogenic would suggest a milder gain-of-function effect.
Train_Line_1567 Of these 16 patients, 9 also carried a JAK2 V617F mutation but none had a mutation within MPL exon 10.
Train_Line_1568 CEBPA double-mutation versus others.
Train_Line_1569 In the next years, targeted gene sequencing is likely to become a frontline diagnostic and prognostic test for MDS, and mutation analysis of SF3B1 should be part of this approach, as suggested in Table 3.
Train_Line_1570 Table 3. Univariate and multivariate analysis for risk of AML progression in MDS patients.
Train_Line_1571 Mutations in IDH1/2 are enriched in CN-AML, where the mutational frequencies are 10% to 16% for IDH1 and 10% to 19% for IDH2, respectively.
Train_Line_1572 Survival and time to progression to AML were updated to June 2011 and measured from time of sample collection or diagnosis at Kings College Hospital.
Train_Line_1573 When we performed the conservation study, we could find these location were well-conserved interspecies, so we just guessed these amino acid changes might have effect on the LNK structure or its function (See Supporting Information II).
Train_Line_1574 In the present study, ASXL1 mutations were detected in 22.7% and 17.1% of MDS patients defined either by the FAB or the 2008 WHO classification, respectively.
Train_Line_1575 We detected a total of 36 types of somatic mutations in CALR (insertions and deletions) that caused a frameshift (Fig. 2A, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_1576 Families (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note) were recruited, and sample use was approved through institutional human ethics review board-approved protocols from the Australian Familial Haematological Cancer Study (Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) #091203 and #100702, and Children, Youth and Women's Health Service #REC1542/12/12, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia), The Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the University of Washington (Seattle, Washington, USA).

(A) Gene-expression ratios in mutant (n = 18) and wild-type cases (n = 98) with standard error bars. (B) Gene-expression ratios of TET genes in different disease subtypes within our cohort.
Train_Line_1578 The test cohort (398 patients) comprised all patients in the E1900 trial for whom viably frozen cells were available for DNA extraction and mutational profiling.
Train_Line_1579 In 2005 a major advance in the understanding of the pathogenesis of MPN was made by the discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation.
Train_Line_1580 This would mean that a "mutator" phenotype exists in some MPN patients.
Train_Line_1581 Recent data have shown that ASXL1 interacts with components of the polycomb complex PRC2, namely EZH2 and SUZ12, two proteins involved in the deposition of H3K27me3 histone repressive marks.
Train_Line_1582 Because direct sequencing might not be sensitive enough to detect low level of IDH mutation signal, we therefore sequenced TA clones of the PCR product from this patient.
Train_Line_1583 BCOR is also mutated in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients (7.4%) and BCORL1 in AML patients with myelodysplasia-related changes (9.1%).
Train_Line_1584 The most commonly mutated genes in lower-risk MDS were TET2 (23% of samples), SF3B1 (22%), U2AF1 (16%), ASXL1 (15%), SRSF2 (15%), and DNMT3A (13%).
Train_Line_1585 A recent study in AML patients showed a low frequency of mutations of codon R172 of IDH2.
Train_Line_1586 As in previous studies, the most frequent mutation was K700E, occurring in almost half of the cases, followed by G742D, a mutation rarely found in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_1587 MPLW515L was not detected in any JAK2V617F-negative ET (n 1/4 50) or PV (n 1/4 10) patient samples.
Train_Line_1588 Overall, 29 different kinds of WT1 mutations were detected in 32 patients (6.8%, Table 1), including 26 on exon 7 and 3 on exon 9.
Train_Line_1589 The first identification of a somatic mutation of SF3B1 was done at the end of 2010 by investigators of the Chronic Myeloid Disorders Working Group (CMD-WG) of the International Cancer Genome Consortium.
Train_Line_1590 In our comprehensive spliceosome mutational analysis of 226 patients with WHO-defined CMML, we identified 123 patients (54%) to have a mutation involving SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35.
Train_Line_1591 Therefore, our study provides compelling evidence for SETD2 as a new tumor suppressor.
Train_Line_1592 Among the 193 patients with MDS, information about time to AML progression was available in 148 patients.
Train_Line_1593 To assess the specificity of the binding, 200-fold excess of each unlabeled probe was used as a competitor.
Train_Line_1594 Clinical phenotype of patients harboring splice gene mutations.
Train_Line_1595 Table 3. Sequential studies in the 34 MDS patients who had ASXL1 mutations at diagnosis and/or at follow-ups.
Train_Line_1596 The JAK2V617F mutation results from a guanine to thymine change at nucleotide 1849 of the cDNA, in exon 14 of the gene.
Train_Line_1597 Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate independent prognostic factors for OS and RFS.
Train_Line_1598 For patients age 75 or older but with a good performance status and no comorbidities, selection of treatment may again be contingent on cytogenetics and to a lesser extent on type of AML (de novo vs secondary after MDS or MDS/MPN).
Train_Line_1599 In this subgroup, SRSF2 mutations were associated with an inferior OS (5-year OS, 19% vs 50%; HR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.11-4.5; P = .025) and shorter time to AML progression (5-year AML-free survival, 50% vs 81%; HR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.14-10.27; P = .028; Figure 3A-B).
Train_Line_1600 AML is initially treated with induction chemotherapy, frequently consisting of standard-dosage cytarabine and an anthracycline (eg, daunorubicin).
Train_Line_1601 A potential explanation for this discrepancy is that our study was focused on lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_1602 There is now both controlled and uncontrolled evidence that supports phlebotomy for all patients with PV.
Train_Line_1603 Alterations in DNA methylation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.
Train_Line_1604 Given that these genes affect epigenetic pathways, it will be important to know whether mutations in these genes are mutually exclusive, or whether the genes could have nonoverlapping functional consequences.
Train_Line_1605 Overexpression of mitochondrial ferritin in RARS erythroblasts occurs at a very early stage of erythroid differentiation, suggesting that it might be a cause rather than a consequence of mitochondrial iron overload.
Train_Line_1606 Patients in this risk category have a median survival equivalent to that of patients in the higherrisk intermediate-2 IPSS risk group, a group that is typically considered for more aggressive therapy.
Train_Line_1607 A Murine Model for MPLW515L-Induced Myeloproliferative Disease.
Train_Line_1608 A bone marrow aspirate is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of a patient with suspected AML.
Train_Line_1609 Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia is a leukemia with 20% or more blasts of which 50% or more are of megakaryocytic lineage; megakaryoblasts typically express one or more of the platelet glycoproteins CD41 and/or CD61, and less commonly CD42.
Train_Line_1610 Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival and leukemia-free survival of 1110 patients diagnosed with MDS at the Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, between 1990 and 2012. MDS patients are stratified according to the 2008 WHO classification categories. Multilineage dysplasia and excess of blasts have a considerable impact on outcomes.
Train_Line_1611 11.1 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
Train_Line_1612 The PTPN11 gene encodes the phospho-tyrosyine phosphatase protein SHP-2.
Train_Line_1613 In the day-100 analysis, TP53 and DNMT3A mutations emerged as independent predictors of OS, along with a complex karyotype.
Train_Line_1614 Gene set enrichment analysis using gene sets from Biocarta, KEGG, and gene ontology showed that the immune response pathway was enriched in patients with ASXL1 mutation (nine of 35 enriched gene sets compared with none of 39 enriched gene sets in patients with ASXL1 wild type), whereas adhesion and phosphatase activity was enriched in patients with ASXL1 wild type.
Train_Line_1615 A more pragmatic approach to restore or activate the C/EBPalpha differentiation pathway is through small molecule modulators of the expression of C/EBPalpha, the C/EBPalpha protein itself or the differentiation pathway governed by C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_1616 ASXL1 belongs to the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb (ETP) genes that can both activate or repress Hox genes.
Train_Line_1617 After consolidation therapy, low-level PCR-positivity can be detected in patients even in long-term remission of CBF AML.
Train_Line_1618 TET2 is mutated in 8% to 23% of adult patients with AML.
Train_Line_1619 There was no difference in response to 5-azacitidine between patients with mutation and wild type TP53.
Train_Line_1620 Accession codes.
Train_Line_1621 Originally discovered in Glioblastoma, mutations in two isoforms of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) have been identified in patients with myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_1622 High-resolution melting was performed using the LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System (Roche Diagnostics), using the above mentioned primers for IDH1 mutations (R130) and the following primers for IDH2 mutations (R140 and R172): R140 sense, 5'-GCTGAAGAAGATGTGGAA-3' and anti-sense, 5'-TGATGGGCTCCCGGAAGA-3' ; R172 sense, 5'-CCAAGCCCATCACCATTG-3' and anti-sense, 5'-CCCAGGTCAGTGGATCCC-3'.
Train_Line_1623 Mutant IDH1 in AML has been associated with poor prognosis in cytogenetically normal AML with NPM1+/FLT3-molecular profile and better prognosis in FLT3+ AML.
Train_Line_1624 Uniparental disomy of 17p [UPD(17p); 8.1422.50 Mb in size] encompassing the TP53 locus was detected in 15 of 103 (15%) cases analyzed by SNP arrays.
Train_Line_1625 Differences in the distribution of continuous variables between categories were analyzed by either Mann-Whitney (for comparison of two groups) or Kruskal-Wallis (comparison of three or more groups) test.
Train_Line_1626 Unlike the case with PV, the PVSG did not carry out large scale randomized studies in ET.
Train_Line_1627 Consistently, when we examined the effect of Setd2 knockdown on MLL-rearranged leukemia cells by mRNA-seq, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) further indicated significantly higher expression of the human LSC signature, the human cancer-related embryonic stem cell signature and the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Table 8) in the Setd2 knockdown leukemia cells.
Train_Line_1628 In particular, approximately one-third of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia had somatic mutations of SRSF2.
Train_Line_1629 This observation and the recent identification of somatic mutations in other key components of the spliceosome strongly implicate abnormalities of mRNA splicing in the pathogenesis of MDS.
Train_Line_1630 Specifically, substitutions at position D816 in the activation loop rendered the kinase almost completely resistant to the drug at clinically achievable doses.
Train_Line_1631 Two patients showed a concomitant inactivation of BCOR and BCORL1 (UPN 9 and UPN 10, Table 3).
Train_Line_1632 The incidence of IDH mutations in RAEBT was similar to that in AML we reported previously (18.2%), suggesting RAEBT, now classified as AML by WHO classification, indeed has similar pathogenesis as AML with higher percentage of BM blasts.
Train_Line_1633 In addition, we identified intronic mutations in 2 patients at base pair 1 and 7, respectively, of intron 7/8 of ZRSR2.
Train_Line_1634 Reliable genotype/phenotype relationships include the association of the SF3B1 mutation with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, TET2/SRSF2 comutation with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and activating CSF3R mutation with chronic neutrophilic leukemia.
Train_Line_1635 To test whether the SH2B3 PH domain mutations result in loss of SH2B3 function, BaF3-E were transfected with either WT Sh2b3, the SH2 domain RE mutant (which was shown to abolish SH2B3 function) or the Sh2b3 PH domain mutants EQ and GV.
Train_Line_1636 Cells were stained with phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated STAT5 (pY694) and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated ERK 1/2 (pY202/204; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) antibodies.
Train_Line_1637 In MPL, BM transplantation assays with W515L or W515A mutations led to an ET-like disorder rapidly progressing to myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_1638 In addition, there was no difference in the percentage of patients treated with LDAC or HDAC between the RAS mutated and RAS wild-type groups (Table 1).
Train_Line_1639 We sequenced the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of EPOR, GCSFR, and MPL in 15 JAK2V617F-negative MF patients, 16 JAK2V617F-negative patients with ET, and 4 JAK2V617F-negative PV patients.
Train_Line_1640 A definitive Phase III trial reported by Dematteo and co-workers demonstrated significant benefit of one year of imatinib therapy post-surgery.
Train_Line_1641 In contrast, the other three variations, p.Q423X (c.1267C>T), p.R551W (c.1651C>T), and p.I568T (c.1703T>C), which were detected in each ET, PMF, and PV patient, were not found in 50 control samples.
Train_Line_1642 In brief, 293T cells were transfected with shRNA targeting DDX41 or non-target shRNA control plasmid together with packing plasmid pCMVD8.2 and envelope plasmid containing VSV-G.
Train_Line_1643 5hmC, an oxidized version of 5mC, represents a new base in genomic DNA which may have a specific effect on transcription, recruit and/or inhibit specific DNA binding protein, and/or may represent an intermediate in the process of DNA demethylation.
Train_Line_1644 Response assessment.
Train_Line_1645 However, often it is not possible to collect an adequate leukemia-free autograft at this phase of the disease.
Train_Line_1646 Nonsense mutation Q1138X was found in a patient (UPC 2306) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), for whom an additional high-frequency (39% RMA), nonsynonymous mutation had already been identified, implicating distinct mutant clones (Figure 3B).
Train_Line_1647 Vienna) as covariates, the first two variables were found to be independent prognostic factors.
Train_Line_1648 For cytogenetic classification, metaphases of sufficient quality could be studied by chromosome banding analysis in 219 patients; karyotypes were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.
Train_Line_1649 Amplification conditions were 95--Degree--C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95--Degree--C for 15 s and an annealing temperature of 60--Degree--C (methylation-specific PCR) or 61--Degree--C (unmethylation-specific PCR) for 1 min followed by a final dissociation cycle of 95--Degree--C for 1 min, 55--Degree--C for 30 s and 95--Degree--C for 30 s.
Train_Line_1650 BM cells from Sh2b3 +/+ and Sh2b3 -/- mice (3 of each) were harvested 5 d after treatment with IP 150 lg/kg 5FU and cultured for 1 d in IMDM with 20% FBS, 50 lmol/l b-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/ml mIL3 and mIL6 and 50 ng/ml mSCF.
Train_Line_1651 In addition to the R882 position, only the P904 position has been previously reported to be mutated.
Train_Line_1652 Another approach to improve the prediction of prognosis in lower-risk MDS is to integrate molecular features by including mutation status for critical disease genes.
Train_Line_1653 Sufficient sequence coverage was obtained for 654/692 patients studied, and the main results of mutation analysis of SF3B1 are reported in Table 1.
Train_Line_1654 Major challenges in finding new treatment approaches of MDS are our incomplete understanding of the complex pathophysiology of the disease and the lack of reliable prognostic molecular markers.
Train_Line_1655 Lineage-specific transcription factors control both of these processes and thereby play a pivotal role in the determination of cellular fate.

Train_Line_1658 Results.
Train_Line_1659 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_1660 Accompanied with other mutations, such as FLT3-ITD, WT1 mutations were associated with failure of standard induction chemotherapy.
Train_Line_1661 A screen of established lung cancer cell lines demonstrated that C/EBPalpha expression was undetectable or low in 24 of 30 cell lines examined, and immunohistochemical studies confirmed that C/EBPalpha expression is lost in more than half of all primary tumor specimens.
Train_Line_1662 Two recent studies of pegylated INF-a (~90 lg SC weekly) in PV and ET reported hematologic remissions of ~80% accompanied by decreases in JAK2V617F allele burden (complete molecular remission rate of 5-10%).
Train_Line_1663 In our cohort of MDS patients, NPM1 mutations were not identified in patients with IDH1 mutations, and the rate of NPM1 mutations was very low.
Train_Line_1664 For instance, ring sideroblasts may be found not only in patients with a founding mutation in SF3B1, but also in those with an initiating oncogenic lesion in SRSF2.
Train_Line_1665 Table 1. Genes encoding proteins that are core components of U1 and U2 snRNPs of the spliceosome, and their mutation status in human malignancies.
Train_Line_1666 Once the full spectrum of somatic mutations in MDS has been defined, optimal prognostic scoring systems will need to include relevant molecular features.
Train_Line_1667 Patients with French-American-British (FAB) M6 subtype of AML had the highest incidence (33.3%) of WT1 mutation, whereas those with M0 subtype had the lowest incidence (P = .006).
Train_Line_1668 Impact of WT1 mutation on response to therapy and clinical outcome.
Train_Line_1669 However, the frequency of specific somatic mutations, including IDH1/2, TET2, and EZH2, are more frequent in blast-phase MPN.
Train_Line_1670 However, the median survival and risk of AML progression may vary in the same risk group, especially in the lower-risk ones.
Train_Line_1671 SRSF2 mutations are seen in patients with MDS, CMML, MPN/PMF, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and are very rare in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_1672 Table 1. Comparison of clinical manifestation and laboratory features between MDS patients with and without ASXL1 mutation.
Train_Line_1673 As an experiment for the tumor suppressor functions of DDX41, forced expression in U937 cells, which express low levels of endogenous DDX41, inhibited growth (Figure 4F).
Train_Line_1674 A marked decrease in myeloerythroid progenitors was observed but without detectable effect on HSC.
Train_Line_1675 Aberrations of 17p were detected in 13 (11%); 8 deletions, 4 copy neutral-loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) and one with both deletion and CN-LOH.
Train_Line_1676 We next examined the association of mutation status with overall survival in our lower-risk MDS cohort.
Train_Line_1677 More recently, FLT3, NPM1, and CEBPA mutational analysis was shown to improve risk stratification for patients who do not have karyotypic abnormalities.
Train_Line_1678 Table 1. Presenting clinical and laboratory features and subsequent events in 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, stratified by the presence or absence of IDH mutations.
Train_Line_1679 In adipocytes C/EBPalpha mediates growth arrest and terminal differentiation in concert with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma).
Train_Line_1680 In contrast, in a study by the AMLCG, G-CSF priming did not impact OS or RFS.
Train_Line_1681 Recently, a new cytogenetic category was introduced, that is, the monosomal karyotype (MK) defined by the presence of one single autosomal monosomy in association with at least one additional autosomal monosomy or one structural chromosomal abnormality (in the absence of core binding factor AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia).
Train_Line_1682 With emerging new therapies, for example, treatment with monoclonal antibodies, small molecules, antihormone agents and growth factors, the term "t-AML" has blurred and its definition needs to be revisited.
Train_Line_1683 Because survival in strictly WHO-defined ET is near-normal (15-year survival of ~80%) and the 10-year risk of AML or MF less than 1%, it would be inappropriate to suggest that any current treatment modifies the natural history of the disease.
Train_Line_1684 Recent discovery of novel pathway mutations affecting spliceosome core components prompted us to investigate the 4 most recurrently mutated genes in a large cohort of 221 MDS patients.
Train_Line_1685 RARS is characterized by erythroid dysplasia and ineffective erythropoiesis, and its clinical course is stable for years in most cases with a low risk of leukemic evolution.
Train_Line_1686 Cytogenetic analysis was performed centrally by G- and R-banding analysis.
Train_Line_1687 ASXL1 regulates epigenetic marks and transcription through interaction with polycomb complex proteins and various transcription activators and repressors.
Train_Line_1688 The BCOR V1616fs mutation was absent in T and B lymphocytes and affected 25% of CD34+ CD38- progenitors and 60% of bulky BM cells.
Train_Line_1689 In a comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing in 4 cases with targeted resequencing in 363 patients, Puente et al identified 4 genes that were recurrently mutated in CLL patients (NOTCH1, XPO1, MYD88, and KLHL6).
Train_Line_1690 Number of patients (% of patients with or without ASXL1 mutation in the subgroup).
Train_Line_1691 The threshold was set as dRn = 0.21.
Train_Line_1692 All 11 exons of ZRSR2 and the mutational hotspots of U2AF1 (exon 2 and exon 6) and SRSF2 (exon 1) were sequenced in all MDS patients using primers as described in supplemental Table 1.
Train_Line_1693 An allogeneic HSCT from a matched related donor is currently considered the treatment of choice for patients with unfavorable cytogenetics in CR1; this recommendation is based on results from single studies as well as from metaanalyses.
Train_Line_1694 We found that introduction of SH2B3 mutants into Sh2b3 WT BM cells did not result in enhanced colony formation, suggesting that the mutants do not relieve the functions of endogenous SH2B3, and do not act in a dominant negative manner.
Train_Line_1695 Mutations in EZH2 and in ASXL1 point at deregulation of polycomb activity in MPN.
Train_Line_1696 Although loss of SH2B3 function is not sufficient for the transformation of haematopoietic cells, SH2B3 mutants may affect either disease phenotype or response to therapy.
Train_Line_1697 Hence, accumulating evidence suggests that aberrant activation or overexpression of GATA2 contributes to AML.
Train_Line_1698 We have identified a familial AML syndrome characterized by long latency and germline mutations in the gene coding for the DEAD-Box helicase DDX41 located on chr. 5q35.
Train_Line_1699 There was no significant difference in age, sex, or karyotype between SF3B1-mut and SF3B1-wt patients.
Train_Line_1700 We may speculate that additional mutations enhancing RAS-MAPK-ERK signalling may collaborate in this scenario and contribute to a defect in erythroid cell proliferation and maturation.
Train_Line_1701 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
Train_Line_1702 Furthermore, it provides evidence for a limited genotype-phenotype association, save for the already established association between SF3B1 mutations and RS.
Train_Line_1703 Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 (Janus kinase 2; 9p24) mutation; approximately 96 and 3% displaying somatic activating mutations in exon 14 (JAK2V617F) and exon 12 of JAK2, respectively.
Train_Line_1704 To identify lineage involvement some countries still rely more on cytochemistry, rather than on immunophenotyping (usually by flow cytometry), using myeloperoxidase (MPO) or Sudan black B (SBB) and nonspecific esterase (NSE) stains.
Train_Line_1705 Sh2b3 PH domain mutants inhibit JAK2 V617F-dependent cells to a lesser extent than WT Sh2b3.
Train_Line_1706 No good evidence exists to recommend granulocyte transfusions in the treatment of AML.
Train_Line_1707 In one study, responses occurred across the spectrum of mutations, while in the other responses were restricted to patients with L576P or K642E mutations.
Train_Line_1708 Over-expression of calreticulin attenuates interferon alpha-induced Stat1 phosphorylation, resulting in interferon resistance.
Train_Line_1709 Owing to the small number of patients with an MPL mutation, the more reliable comparisons are those between patients with a JAK2 mutation and those with a CALR mutation.
Train_Line_1710 Similar results were also observed in Western blot analysis (Fig 4E).
Train_Line_1711 Recently, the cytogenetic category of "monosomal karyotype" was described, allowing further risk stratification of CK-AML patients.
Train_Line_1712 How disruption of SETD2 cooperates with other pathogenic mechanisms, especially in promoting the stemness of LSCs, certainly warrants further investigations.
Train_Line_1713 Recently, Allain and colleagues determined the solution structure of SRSF2 in the free-state and in complex with a pyrimidine- and a more purine-rich RNA sequence.
Train_Line_1714 There are, to date, no controlled studies that implicate either hydroxyurea or busulfan as being leukemogenic in either ET or PV.
Train_Line_1715 Heterozygous mutations of IDH1 (R132S, R132G) and IDH2 (codon R140 and R172) have been identified in AML.
Train_Line_1716 Advanced patient age (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.05-1.38; P = .02), WHO classification (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.07-1.38; P < .01), and cytogenetic subgroup (OR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.66-2.46; P < .01) were the only variables significantly affecting OS (supplemental Table 3).
Train_Line_1717 Diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral-blood samples were analyzed from 489 adult patients (17 to 60 years of age) with de novo (n = 438) or secondary AML (n = 51) with French-American-British (FAB] classification M0-M2, or M4-M7, who were entered into the multicenter treatment trials AML Sueddeutsche Hämoblastose Gruppe 0199 (ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT00209833, June 1999 to September 2004, n = 332) or AML Sueddeutsche Hämoblastose Gruppe 0295 (February 1995 to May 1999, n = 157) and for whom pretreatment cell samples were available.
Train_Line_1718 5-hmC has been shown to be associated with increased gene expression in an embryonic stem cell model and to induce demethylation, as maintenance methylation via DNMT1 is unable to recognize 5-hmC in the post replicative step.
Train_Line_1719 Overall survival end-points, measured from the date of first sample collection, were death (failure) and alive at last follow-up (censored).
Train_Line_1720 10. Relapsed AML.
Train_Line_1721 Sequential studies of all these genes were also performed in 305 samples from 112 patients during clinical follow-ups.
Train_Line_1722 The acquired nature of substitutions S34F and Q157R was verified by sequencing DNA from CD3+ cells (n = 2) or buccal swab (n = 1).
Train_Line_1723 One-hundred and twenty-three (54%) patients had at least one of the three spliceosome mutations: 55% in CMML-1 and 66% in CMML-2.
Train_Line_1724 A somatic mutation of SF3B1 may therefore represent a second genetic event: for instance, it may occur in a patient with MDS del(5q) in whom del(5q) was the initiating event.
Train_Line_1725 As pointed out by Gotlib et al, CNL and aCML are likely overlapping neoplasms: although the pathogenesis of the former is mainly characterized by CSF3R mutation, that of aCML is likely more multifactorial.
Train_Line_1726 SH2B3 mutants retain JAK2 binding capacity as well as binding to CBL and 14-3-3.
Train_Line_1727 Moreover, the authors detected homozygous mutations at four distinct gene loci that have been associated with AML (WT1, FLT3, C/EBPalpha, and RUNX1).
Train_Line_1728 Driver mutant genes include those of RNA splicing (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2), DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH1/2), chromatin modification (ASXL1 and EZH2), transcription regulation (RUNX1), DNA repair (TP53), signal transduction (CBL, NRAS, and KRAS), and cohesin complex (STAG2).
Train_Line_1729 Overall, we studied 1215 patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis (Fig.
Train_Line_1730 Genetic Predictors of Response to Induction Chemotherapy.
Train_Line_1731 Additional diagnostic tests and procedures in the initial work-up of a patient with AML are given in Table 3.
Train_Line_1732 Recent data considers JAK2V617F and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as additional risk factors for thrombosis.
Train_Line_1733 Nonetheless, the acquisition of TET2 mutations is an important event, both in the pathogenesis as well as the transformation of MDS.
Train_Line_1734 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_1735 Table 1. Clinical characteristics of 222 MDS patients of the French cohort according to BCOR and BCORL1 mutation status.
Train_Line_1736 Areas covered.
Train_Line_1737 None of the sequentially analysed samples showed a disappearance of the mutant clone or emergence of new clones, suggesting an early occurrence of TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_1738 No mutation was identified in any of the 73 MPD patients (15 with PV, 25 with ET, and 33 with MF) indicating that inactivation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 by acquired mutation is not a frequent finding within MPD.
Train_Line_1739 Only leukocyte-depleted erythrocyte and platelet components should be given to decrease the risk of HLA-associated alloimmunization and reduce the risk of CMV transmission.
Train_Line_1740 NOTE. Number of patients with mutated gene = 24; with unmutated gene, 130; only frameshift mutations considered. Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicate an increased risk of an event for the first category listed.
Train_Line_1741 The mutations were heterozygous and were computationally predicted to alter the protein function.
Train_Line_1742 Although well described for its canonical role for its signal transduction, JAK2 has more recently also been shown to have direct epigenetic functions.
Train_Line_1743 Follow-up information was available for 153 of the 193 patients with MDS.
Train_Line_1744 We only counted frameshift mutations and nonsense mutations of ASXL1 gene as true mutations in this study as previously reported.
Train_Line_1745 The evidence for busulfan leukemogenicity in the context of treatment for PV or ET is equally weak and inappropriately extrapolated from older patients with advanced phase disease and exposed to multiple cytoreductive drugs.
Train_Line_1746 Patients harboring ZRSR2 mutations were almost exclusively male (24 of 25, 96%) and often presented with isolated neutropenias (median: 1.1 vs 2.2 x 109/L; P = .009).
Train_Line_1747 RESULTS.
Train_Line_1748 In one of the very few controlled studies in ET, Cortelazzo et al randomized 114 mostly high-risk patients to hydroxyurea (n = 56) or not (n = 58).
Train_Line_1749 In univariate analysis, OS and AML transformation rates according to the mutation status of the 4 different splice genes were similar (Figure 3A-H).
Train_Line_1750 Cytogenetic abnormalities were categorized into 5 prognostic subgroups that were shown to have significant prognostic relevance with different median survival and risk of evolution into AML (Table 2).
Train_Line_1751 JAK2 is the only JAK capable of mediating the signaling of EPO-R and MPL.
Train_Line_1752 Though several studies seem to suggest a prognostic significance in AML, there is no data regarding the relevance of DNMT3A mutations to phenotype, time to transformation, or survival in MPN.
Train_Line_1753 In 2003, an international working group last reported on recommendations for diagnosis, response assessment, and treatment outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_1754 The impact of U2AF1 mutation on the disease progression was also explored.
Train_Line_1755 Mutations were identified in 92% of patients, most frequently in the ASXL1 (29%), TP53 (21%), DNMT3A (18%), and RUNX1 (16%) genes.
Train_Line_1756 Further preclinical studies using in vitro and in vivo systems will improve of the role of mutations in epigenetic modifiers in AML pathogenesis, and the effects of inhibiting epigenetic modulators on normal hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_1757 For the assessment of sensitivity to stimuli, both DDX41-deficient and control CD34+ cells were plated in various amounts of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (0, 1, and 10 ng/ml of GM-CSF) and FBS (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% of FBS).
Train_Line_1758 ASXL1 mutations were correlated with an intermediate-risk karyotype (P = .002) but not with other clinical parameters.
Train_Line_1759 Their precise roles in hematopoiesis and in the pathogenesis of MPN, as well as their prognostic impact and potential as a therapeutic target, are currently under investigation.
Train_Line_1760 Because BCOR mutations appear to associate with CN-AML and NPM1 and CEBPA mutations define WHO 20082 provisional entities, we next investigated their relationship.
Train_Line_1761 TABLE I. Clinical and Laboratory Features and Subsequent Events in 226 Patients with World Health Organization Defined CMML.
Train_Line_1762 JAK2 V617F and MPL exon 10 status were determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction
Train_Line_1763 4.6 Genome-wide studies.
Train_Line_1764 We also correlated the presence of TP53 mutations to LOH at 17p locus; only 47% of patients with mutations had LOH (deletion or CN-LOH).
Train_Line_1765 Thus far, in CMML loss of function gene mutations involving ASXL1 and EZH2 have been associated with poor outcome.
Train_Line_1766 Somatic DNMT3A mutations have later been detected in ~10% to 15% of patients with different subtypes of MDSs.
Train_Line_1767 Our study suggests that LNK mutations occur in low frequency in human MPN, and can occur in several regions of the LNK gene not only on a pleckstrin homology domain which have been regarded as a 'hot spot'.
Train_Line_1768 TABLE II. CMML: FLT3 Mutated Versus FLT3 Nonmutated.
Train_Line_1769 Linear regression and X2 test were used where indicated.
Train_Line_1770 Complex karyotypes often contain numerous chromosome aberrations that can only be partially or not at all interpreted using standard cytogenetic techniques.
Train_Line_1771 Purpose.
Train_Line_1772 Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR and the coding regions and splice sites of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were sequenced (Online Supplementary Table S1).
Train_Line_1773 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NTUH, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_1774 Long-term follow-up has shown a small, but statistically significant survival advantage for patients treated with ruxolinitib compared to those treated with placebo (COMFORT I), or best supportive care (COMFORT II).
Train_Line_1775 Interestingly, SH2B3 deletional mutations associated with activating mutations in IL7R (which signals via JAK1 and JAK3) were recently reported in high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (Roberts et al 2012).
Train_Line_1776 Mutations in DNMT3A have also been identified in AML through array-based genomic resequencing of human leukemia.
Train_Line_1777 Initial involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in AML occurs in less than 5% of patients.
Train_Line_1778 This indirectly offered a connection between WT1 gene and erythroblasts.
Train_Line_1779 The double knockout leads to a rapidly lethal MPN with leukocytosis and excess of monocytes, a phenotype close to myelo-monocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_1780 Table I outlines the presenting clinical and laboratory features and subsequent events in the 226 study patients with CMML, stratified by PB and BM blasts and % BM RS.
Train_Line_1781 Randomized trials comparing demethylating agents with conventional cytotoxic agents in older AML patients with blast percentages more than 30% are underway.
Train_Line_1782 Patients with SF3B1 mutations presented with a distinct blood count at diagnosis.
Train_Line_1783 The introduction of platelet transfusions has dramatically reduced mortality from hemorrhage in AML.
Train_Line_1784 Downregulation of C/EBPalpha in squamous cell cancers of the head and neck region has been reported correlating with degree of promoter methylation, while no mutations were found in 59 tumor specimens examined.
Train_Line_1785 Figure 2. DDX41 Gene Structure and Clonal Architecture in DDX41 Mutants. (A) DDX41 is located at the distal end of chromosome 5q, 5q35.3, and encodes a protein that contains three known domains and ATP binding sites, as illustrated. The pink bars visualize deletions of chromosome 5q in our MDS cohort that include the DDX41 locus. The red triangles indicate DDX41 mutations in patients with hematological malignancies from our cohort and TCGA. Red circles indicate the identified germline mutations of DDX41 (p.Q52fs, p.D140fs, p.M155I, and p.I396T). The p.R525H mutation was detected in 13 out of 1,045 cases. Purple triangles show DDX41 mutations in non-hematological malignancies. Sanger sequencing confirming recurrent germline mutation (p.D140fs; left) and somatic mutation (p.R525H; right) of DDX41 are shown. (B) DDX41 mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR in cases with deleted DDX41 locus compared with cases without deletion. Boxes represent 25- 75 percentiles. A line inside a box represents the median. Whiskers indicate maximum and minimum values.
Train_Line_1786 CONCLUSIONS.
Train_Line_1787 However, in 3 randomized studies, no significant differences in severe bleeding were shown if a threshold of less than 10 x 109/L rather than less than 20 x 109/L for prophylactic platelet transfusion was used.
Train_Line_1788 IDH mutations were studied sequentially in 454 samples from 151 patients, including nine patients with IDH mutations at diagnosis and 142 without.
Train_Line_1789 We show differential effects of the mutations on the transactivation of target genes, cellular differentiation, apoptosis and global gene expression.
Train_Line_1790 Details of all TET2 mutations and patient context are shown.
Train_Line_1791 Both proteins interact with histone deacetylases but also have specific properties.
Train_Line_1792 Hence, it is possible that any affect of SOCS3 methylation would be masked. Additionally, JAK2 V617F-positive patients may exhibit increased expression in those cells not carrying a methylated SOCS3 promoter.
Train_Line_1793 The prognostic impact of IDH1 mutations was evaluated in MDS patients for whom follow-up information was available (n=153).
Train_Line_1794 These 5 amino acids play a major role in the cytosolic conformation of MPL and prevent spontaneous activation of the receptor.
Train_Line_1795 Thus, primary considerations for treatment of t-AML patients should include the status of the primary cancer, the patient's performance status, the presence of complications from primary therapy, and the leukemic karyotype.
Train_Line_1796 Targeting mediators of cell survival is being explored as a therapeutic approach.
Train_Line_1797 We also specifically assessed JAK2 V617F-negative ET patients known to carry a mutation within MPL20 (n=13).
Train_Line_1798 Abbreviations: MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; RAEB-2, refractory anemia with excess blasts-2; del(5q), MDS with isolated del(5q); RAEB-1, refractory anemia with excess blasts-1; RA, refractory anemia; NK, not known; RARS, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts; MDS-U, MDS unclassifiable.
Train_Line_1799 METHODS.
Train_Line_1800 In addition, AML is often characterized by class II mutations that involve transcription factor signaling that impairs hematopoietic differentiation, frequently via gene fusions generated by balanced chromosomal rearrangements, such as RUNX1(AML1)-RUNX1T1(ETO) and t(8; 21)(q22;q22), CBFB-MYH11 and inv(16) (p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), or PML-RARA and t(15;17)(q22;q12).
Train_Line_1801 Although not reaching statistical significance, BCOR mutations were exclusive with mutations in TP53 and ZRSR2, the only 2 putative tumor suppressor genes in the investigated gene set.
Train_Line_1802 By Fisher exact test, P was not significant (.2), likely because of the low total number of BCOR-mutated patients.
Train_Line_1803 The differences in overall survival between LR-PSS categories for patients in our cohort were highly significant (P <= .001 for each comparison) and were comparable to those in the original description of the LR-PSS (6.7, 2.3, and 1.2 years in categories 1, 2, and 3, respectively).
Train_Line_1804 We found that 8 of the total 19 SETD2 mutations (42.1%) identified in 241 patients with acute leukemia were either nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncate a portion of the C terminus domain of SETD2 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3).
Train_Line_1805 It is recommended that at least 200 leukocytes on blood smears and 500 nucleated cells on marrow smears be counted, with the latter containing spicules.
Train_Line_1806 Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors.
Train_Line_1807 Somatic mutations of spliceosome genes were unknown until recently.
Train_Line_1808 RESULTS.
Train_Line_1809 c-CBL and CBL-b proteins contain several domains: an N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain followed by a Ring domain, which is important for the transfer of ubiquitin moieties (Figure 1B).
Train_Line_1810 P values <0.05 were considered significant.
Train_Line_1811 Index family 1 had four affected members in clear succession.
Train_Line_1812 Affymetrix 250K and 6.0 Kit (Affymetrix) were used.
Train_Line_1813 Mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, and EZH2 were associated with a hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL (P <= .008 for each comparison).
Train_Line_1814 Also, patients with DNMT3A mutations more frequently had a mutation in NPM1, FLT3, and IDH1; more often belonged to the NPM1/FLT3 low-risk group; and had higher gene expression levels of MLL5 compared with DNMT3A wild-type patients (Table 1).
Train_Line_1815 Survival data were available for 323 of the 533 patients with MDS successfully analyzed for SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_1816 After adjusting for this interaction and cytogenetics (core binding factor [CBF] AML v non-CBF AML), wtRAS patients receiving HDAC had lower relapse risk than wtRAS patients receiving LDAC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; P = .04); however, mutRAS patients receiving HDAC had greater reduction in relapse risk (HR = 0.28; P = .002) compared with mutRAS patients treated with LDAC.
Train_Line_1817 To assess megakaryocyte ploidy, bone marrow cells were cultured for four days in RPMI/10% FBS containing 50 ng/mL mTPO and 10 mg/mL SCF.
Train_Line_1818 These patients had >20% blasts at the time of sample and neither did these patients achieve remission nor relapse after CR, to be included in progression analysis.
Train_Line_1819 Despite the high frequency of mutations in DNMT3A in AML and their consistent association with adverse prognosis, the biochemical effect of DNMT3A mutations on DNA cytosine methylation and transcription has not been definitively delineated.
Train_Line_1820 Interestingly, in human MPN the same oncogenic event, i.e., JAK2 V617F, is associated with either proliferation of the erythroid lineage and a high haematocrit in polycythaemia vera or with decreased bone marrow erythroid progenitors in primary myelofibrosis and peripheral blood anaemia.
Train_Line_1821 Mutations of individual genes can provide prognostic information that is independent of the IPSS score in patients with MDS generally, but the prognostic significance of mutations has not been examined specifically in patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_1822 Indeed, somatic mutations of SRSF2 or ZRSR2 have been recently identified in 7% of cases of MDS with ring sideroblasts that had wild-type SF3B1.
Train_Line_1823 These include mutations in TET2, ASXL1, IDH1 or IDH2, DNMT3A, and PHF6.
Train_Line_1824 These mutational events can be divided into those that are secondary and acquired during disease progression, and those that are founder in nature.
Train_Line_1825 Inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR/ABL oncoprotein by imatinib (Gleevec) in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) has revolutionised the treatment of this disease.
Train_Line_1826 Table 3. Multivariable Models Identifying Independent Significant Risk Factors for OS.
Train_Line_1827 We included CMML, because from a practical approach, they are treated as MDS.

Train_Line_1829 Effect of Sh2b3 PH domain mutants on Jak2 downstream signalling.
Train_Line_1830 Involved field radiation therapy may be considered to enhance local tumor control.
Train_Line_1831 There was a significant association of SF3B1 mutations with the presence of ring sideroblasts, and the mutant gene had a positive predictive value for this morphologic feature of 97.7% (95% CI, 93.5%-99.5%).
Train_Line_1832 RESULTS.
Train_Line_1833 Western blots performed for SF3B1 and PRPF8 (Figure S6D) confirmed the differences between mutant and WT DDX41 immunoprecipitates.
Train_Line_1834 Table 3 Univariate and multivariable survival analysis of presenting clinical and laboratory features in 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_1835 The JAK2 locus was found affected by a 9p loss of heterozygosity in 30% of PV patients (Table 1, Figure 1).
Train_Line_1836 The panels used included from 94 to 111 candidate genes, and in the 2 largest studies enrolling >700 patients, oncogenic mutations were identified with confidence in about half of the genes sequenced.
Train_Line_1837 Cumulative incidence of AML transformation was measured from date of MDS diagnosis to time of AML diagnosis, considering death as a competing event.
Train_Line_1838 Resequencing in 1107 samples from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms showed that CALR mutations were absent in polycythemia vera.
Train_Line_1839 We observed a higher frequency of SETD2 mutations in MLL-rearranged patients with leukemia (22.2%, 6 out of 27) compared to patients with leukemia that did not have MLL rearrangements (4.6%, 8 out of 173) in the patient cohort (P = 0.005; Fig. 2 and Table 1).
Train_Line_1840 The impact of secondary genetic lesions in cases with balanced translocations or inversions requires further investigation.
Train_Line_1841 The current limitations which prevent implementation of such sequencing in clinical practice include the high cost, slow turnaround time, and lack of clinical validation.
Train_Line_1842 We have previously shown that SH2B3 strongly binds through its SH2 domain to phosphorylated JAK2 WT and JAK2 V617F, whereas other SH2B3 regions facilitate weaker interactions with non-phosphorylated JAK2 (Gery et al 2009).
Train_Line_1843 EXPERT OPINION.
Train_Line_1844 Sole N-terminal, sole C-terminal, and other mutations were found in 11.4%, 9%, 12.6% of cases.
Train_Line_1845 Recommendations: In addition to low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy in case of PV, high-risk patients with PV or ET had to receive hydroxyurea to minimize their risk of thrombosis (starting dose 500 mg BID).
Train_Line_1846 Incidence and Prognostic Influence of DNMT3A Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Train_Line_1847 Significantly, TET2 mutations were also found in CD3+ T cells (median, 23.5% RMA), confirming our previous findings.
Train_Line_1848 It remains an open question whether the presence of a FLT3-ITD impacts on prognosis in patients with mutant CEBPA.
Train_Line_1849 Based on preliminary data from ongoing anti-JAK2 clinical trials, I suspect that JAK inhibitors might become the most effective agents for the treatment of MPN-associated pruritus.
Train_Line_1850 There remain important unanswered questions regarding the genetic basis of these tumors, including how a single point mutation in JAK2 can contribute to the pathogenesis of three related, but clinically distinct, myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_1851 Other treatment modalities that have been reported to be useful in PV-associated pruritus include JAK inhibitors, IFN-a, and narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy.
Train_Line_1852 We studied the effect of these mutations on the JAK2 signalling pathway in cells expressing either wild type JAK2 or the JAK2 V617F mutation.
Train_Line_1853 HEL cells were spin-infected on 2 consecutive days with retroviral supernatants containing 6 lg/ml polybrene (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at 750 g (Beckman GS-CR, Brea, CA, USA) for 60 min at 25--Degree--C.
Train_Line_1854 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of diseases originating in the hematopoietic stem cell.
Train_Line_1855 PRC2 is involved in various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, cell-identity maintenance, aging, and plasticity.
Train_Line_1856 IDH2 mutation was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients with lower-risk MDS, based on international prognosis scoring system (IPSS), FAB classification, WHO classification, or revised IPSS (all P <= 0.001), but not in higher-risk groups.
Train_Line_1857 Percentage of WT1 mutant was determined using PCR and fragment analysis as previously reported.
Train_Line_1858 Transformations to myelofibrosis were not reported during the whole-study period.
Train_Line_1859 The rationale for this incorporation was that multilineage dysplasia represents a strong negative prognostic factor per se irrespective of the presence or absence of ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_1860 Indeed, our co-transfection studies are consistent with altered transactivation by p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del with PU.1 (Fig. 3e). p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or any other alterations in GATA2 were absent in our heterogeneous cohort of individuals with sporadic AML, although we cannot rule out possible mutations in samples with lowpercentage blasts.
Train_Line_1861 TP53 alterations were found in 137 of 171 (80%) CK+/MK+ AMLs and in only 20 of 48 (42%) CK+/MK- AMLs (P < .0001; Table 1).
Train_Line_1862 Mutations in DNMT3A and SF3B1 were not exclusive of mutations in any of the other frequently mutated genes, but they cooccurred with each other significantly more often than predicted by chance (P < .001), suggesting a previously unappreciated molecular synergy between these two genetic lesions.
Train_Line_1863 Among the 470 AML patients recruited, 266 were males and 204 were females with a median age of 52 years (range, 15-90 years).
Train_Line_1864 BCOR somatic mutations were: (1) disruptive events similar to the germline BCOR mutations causing the oculo-facio-cardiodental genetic syndrome; (2) associated with decreased BCOR mRNA levels, absence of full-length BCOR, and absent or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein; (3) virtually mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations; and (4) frequently associated with DNMT3A mutations, suggesting cooperativity among these genetic alterations.
Train_Line_1865 There is currently limited information on the prognostic impact of IDH mutations in MDS and other chronic myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_1866 There was no association of WT1 mutation with other chromosomal abnormalities, including +8, +11, +13, +21, -5/del(5q), and -7/del(7q).
Train_Line_1867 The adverse prognostic effect of TET2 mutations in CN-AML patients with and without the FLT3-ITD mutations provides a rationale for considering the use of allogeneic transplantation in patients with FLT3 wild-type, TET2 mutant CN-AML in first complete remission.
Train_Line_1868 We sequenced the entire coding regions of TET2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, CEBPA, PHF6, WT1, TP53, EZH2, RUNX1, and PTEN and the regions of previously described mutations for FLT3, NPM1, HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, KIT, IDH1, and IDH2.
Train_Line_1869 However, different results were also reported by other groups.
Train_Line_1870 C/EBPalpha is expressed in basal and suprabasal keratinocytes of the epidermis, and forced overexpression of C/EBPalpha in keratinocytes leads to cell cycle blockade.
Train_Line_1871 The entire trephine section was assessed using a Modified Quick Score (MQS) (Allred et al 1993, 1998) (Table SII), calculated based on the percentage of cells stained with TP53 and on the intensity of the stain.
Train_Line_1872 The structure of SOCS3 and the location of the CpG island are shown in Figure 2A.
Train_Line_1873 Recently, mutations in SH2B3 (LNK), a negative regulator of JAK2-STAT signalling pathway, were described in approximately 6% of patients with chronic phase MPN (Oh et al 2010a,b; Ha & Jeon, 2011; Hurtado et al 2011; Lasho et al 2011) and up to 10% of blast phase MPN patients (Pardanani et al 2010).
Train_Line_1874 However, other studies, including our own analysis, show that SF3B1 mutations do not represent an independent prognostic factor, but rather that the favorable prognosis of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations may be a consequence of the favorable prognosis for MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_1875 JAK2 mutation status had no impact on platelet count (p=0.56), spleen size (p=1.00), marrow fibrosis (p=0.19) or all vascular events (p=0.67).
Train_Line_1876 In 141 of the 234 (60%) patients with CK-AML, a total of 168 mutations were identified; 161 (96%) were located in the sequence-specific DNA-binding domain of p53 (residues 102-292).
Train_Line_1877 In addition, we also observed no survival impact of SRSF2 mutations in patients with CMML in which this mutation is more prevalent.
Train_Line_1878 The close association between mutations of TP53 and specifically -5/5q- in de novo MDS is intriguing and needs further functional analysis, although such a correlation exists in tMDS (Christiansen et al 2001) and solid cancers (Tavassoli et al 1996).
Train_Line_1879 Among the 19 patients with IDH2 mutation, 15 had R140Q mutation, one had R140W mutation, one had R140L mutation, and the remaining two had R172K mutation.
Train_Line_1880 As expected, the other predictors for OS and PFS included age, WHO subtypes, IPSS category and transfusion dependency. (Table SIV).
Train_Line_1881 Using age >=60 years, hemoglobin below normal value and leukocyte count >15 x 109/L, one study demonstrated a median survival of >20 years in the absence of all 3 risk factors and ~9 years in the presence of two of the three risk factors.
Train_Line_1882 MM Patnaik; CA Hanson; JM Hodnefield; TL Lasho; CM Finke; RA Knudson; RP Ketterling; A Pardanani; A Tefferi.
Train_Line_1883 The primers for LNK (exon 2-8) and JAK2 (exon 12 and 14) were designed using Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/), and the sequencing was conducted using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) (See Supporting Information III).
Train_Line_1884 Prognostic impact of SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutations.
Train_Line_1885 Recently, somatic mutations of TET2, SRSF2, ASXL1, CBL, and RUNX1 have been detected in ~90% of patients with advanced mastocytosis, and overall survival was found to be significantly shorter in patients with additional mutations than in those carrying KIT (D816V) only.
Train_Line_1886 We observed a misalignment of the sequence reads covering the site of mutation, owing to a repetitive element in the affected genomic region (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_1887 Similarly, these mutations are seen in a small fraction (<10%) of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are strongly associated with the presence of BM RS, but do not affect disease outcome.
Train_Line_1888 Calreticulin, Ca2+, and calmodulin have previously been shown to modulate the activity of Stats.
Train_Line_1889 These results provide biologic plausibility to our clinical observations.
Train_Line_1890 In the subgroup of CN-AML, additional mutation analyses were performed for CEBPA, MLL-PTD, WT1 and WT1 SNP rs16754, NRAS, IDH1, and IDH2, and expression levels of BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MN1, MLL5, and WT1 were quantified as previously described using cDNA from the KG1A cell line (BAALC, ERG, MLL5), plasmids (MN1, WT1), or a patient sample (EVI1) to construct a standard curve using ABL as a housekeeping gene (Ipsogen, Marseille, France).
Train_Line_1891 The action of KIT kinase inhibitors, especially imatinib, sunitinib, dasatinib and PKC412, on different primary and secondary mutants is discussed.
Train_Line_1892 Retrovirus-mediated ectopic expression of MLL-NRIP3 in mouse hematopoietic cells was able to induce the same type of myeloid leukemia as that of the patient in a mouse transplant model (Fig. 1c,d and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Train_Line_1893 We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML.
Train_Line_1894 Inhibition of ASXL1 function leads to loss of H3K27me3 histone marks.
Train_Line_1895 days.
Train_Line_1896 Therefore, TP53 mutational status should be assessed in clinical trials investigating novel agents to identify compounds that may be effective in this subset of patients.
Train_Line_1897 BACKGROUND.
Train_Line_1898 Some studies have reported that SF3B1 mutations are a favorable marker in MDS.
Train_Line_1899 No other significant differences were identified between the two groups.
Train_Line_1900 In one study there was no benefit in remission duration or OS with 3 years of intensive maintenance compared with autologous HSCT as postremission therapy, whereas maintenance proved superior for DFS to 1 course of consolidation according to the sequential HiDAC and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) protocol (HiDAC 1g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 2, 8, and 9; mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 on days 3, 4, 10, and 11).
Train_Line_1901 Mutation patterns of SRSF2.
Train_Line_1902 METHODS.
Train_Line_1903 These investigations were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, and by other local institutional review boards.
Train_Line_1904 Clinical implications of U2AF1 mutation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and its stability during disease progression.
Train_Line_1905 In two other sons (55 and 56 years), the heterozygous mutation (c.419insGATG, p.D140fs) was detected with no apparent disease, but both of them have developed slight monocytosis.
Train_Line_1906 The prognostic significance for most of the mutated genes was less marked after adjusting for LR-PSS risk category, indicating that the clinical parameters incorporated into the LR-PSS capture some of the prognostic significance of point mutations (Table 2).
Train_Line_1907 This patient was negative for JAK2V617F and presented with grade 2 fibrosis.
Train_Line_1908 Figure 1. Signaling pathways involved in the pathogenesis of MPNs. (A) JAK2V617F is attached to the cytosolic juxtamembrane region of dimeric cytokine receptors, such as EpoR or MPL (TpoR) but can also be attached to the cytosolic region of other JAK2-using cytokine receptors, such as the IFN-gamma receptor 2 chain. When bound to homodimeric cytokine receptors, JAK2V617F induces constitutive signaling via STAT5, STAT3, RAS-MAPK, and PI-3'K-Akt pathways, which all regulate gene expression and promote survival, proliferation, and differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors. Constitutive STAT5 and STAT3 signaling is frequently described in MPN myeloid cells, and constitutive STAT1 signaling has been found in certain cases such as erythroid colonies of ET patients. Negative regulators such as CIS (cytokine-inducible SH2) and SOCS proteins (such as SOCS3) are transcriptionally induced by the activated JAK2 but in general appear to be overwhelmed and cannot efficiently block constitutive JAK2V617F signaling. LNK exerts a negative effect on JAK2V617F signaling and constrains the MPN phenotype. Only a minority of patients have LNK mutations. Activation of RAS signaling is counteracted by NF1 (neurofibromatosis 1), a protein that stimulates the GTPase activity of RAS and that is deleted in a minority of MPN patients. (B) Domain structure of negative signaling regulators LNK, c-CBL, and NF-1. Pro indicates proline-rich domain; PH, plekstrin homology domain; SH2, src-homology 2; TKB, tyrosine kinase binding domain; RING, really interesting new gene finges domain; GRD, GAP (GTPase-activating domain)-related domain; and CRAL-TRIO, cellular retinaldehyde and TRIO domain.
Train_Line_1909 Figure 1. Histogram of SF3B1 mutant allele burden. The bimodal distribution has been highlighted by adding a Gaussian kernel density plot to the histogram. The first normal distribution (on the left) accounts for 22% of observations, with a mean value for SF3B1 mutant allele burden equal to 15%. The second normal distribution (on the right) accounts for 78% of observations, with a mean value equal to 41%.
Train_Line_1910 One informative SNP (RS12345895) within the 46/1 JAK2 haplotype was analyzed by pyrosequencing using primers and conditions described previously.
Train_Line_1911 For these cases the designation RARS-T MF was used in keeping with a recently published consensus on the terminology of MPD.
Train_Line_1912 Furthermore, JAK2V617F HSC did not outcompete JAK2 wild-type HSC in one case of allogenic human BM transplantation.
Train_Line_1913 We hypothesized that mutations, as disease-intrinsic abnormalities, would be more closely associated with risk of relapse after HSCT rather than other causes of transplantation-related mortality.
Train_Line_1914 Within clinical trials, it is usually recommended that repeat marrow aspirates be performed every 3 months for the first 2 years; in some cases, surveillance continues every 6 months for the following 2 to 3 years.
Train_Line_1915 Response to induction therapy was as follows: complete remission (CR) 28% and 50% (P = .01), refractory disease (RD) 51% and 35% (P = .06), and early/hypoplastic death 21% and 15% (P = .52) for CK+/TP53-altered and CK+/TP53-unaltered AML, respectively (Table 1).
Train_Line_1916 This allowed reliable detection of mutant clones down to 1-2% allelic mutation burden, defined as the proportion of clonal sequence reads containing the mutation.
Train_Line_1917 Since there is a correlation between JAK2 V617F status and SOCS3 expression level in IMF (Figure 3C), we separately analyzed IMF patients according to JAK2 V617F status.
Train_Line_1918 The protective effect of SF3B1 mutation on OS was lost in multivariate analysis because of significant colinearity among predictor variables.
Train_Line_1919 Patients and Methods.
Train_Line_1920 In myeloid neoplasms, the mutant allele burden in a bone marrow sample is most commonly between 40 and 50% due to the presence of non-myeloid cells.
Train_Line_1921 We examined the allele and genotype frequencies of two known synonymous SNPs in our cohort (rs2276598, rs41284843) and found no significant differences, comparing either MDS patients to race-matched control subjects (Supplemental Table 2) or comparing MDS patients with DNMT3A mutations to MDS patients without DNMT3A mutations (Supplemental Table 3).
Train_Line_1922 As a result, WT1 as a tumor suppressor gene is suggested.
Train_Line_1923 Association of ASXL1 mutation with other genetic alterations.
Train_Line_1924 The evaluation of the subtype-specific prevalence of LNK mutation was not performed due to small numbers of cases harboring the mutations.
Train_Line_1925 MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene; 1p34) mutations occur in approximately 4% of ET patients, 8% of PMF patients, and rarely in PV.
Train_Line_1926 Figure 1. BCOR and BCORL1 truncating mutations in MDS and related disorders. (A) Localization of mutations identified in BCOR and BCORL1 genes. Each mutation is shown with an arrow. Only frameshift, nonsense, and splice site mutations are indicated. Confirmed somatic mutations are discriminated by an asterisk. The domain structures are shown in colored boxes as indicated. (B) Co-occurrence of BCOR mutations with other genes studied in 354 MDS patients (Circos Graph made on http://circos.ca/; TM, truncating mutations). The P value from Fisher's exact test is shown, and the gene appears in red for statistically significant associations.
Train_Line_1927 In contrast, in myeloid disorders EZH2 mutations may be associated with deletion of the other copy or preferentially with loss of heterozygosity.
Train_Line_1928 I would also argue that hydroxyurea-refractory PV or ET is often adequately managed by treatment with busulfan or IFN-a.
Train_Line_1929 In this study, we performed total exonic resequencing of DNMT3A using DNA from 150 de novo MDS patients, of which 46 developed secondary AML, and identified 13 somatic mutations in 12 patients (8.0% of cases).
Train_Line_1930 The emerging paradigm of mutated genes in myeloid neoplasms is rapidly expanding and now includes mutations affecting the epigenetic factors (Ernst et al 2010) and also RNA splicing machinery (Yoshida et al 2011).
Train_Line_1931 These are typical subclonal driver mutations, associated with a poor clinical outcome.
Train_Line_1932 Somatic variations in ZF2 of GATA2 have also been reported during chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis (p.Leu359Val and p.Ala341_Gly346del) and recently, variations in ZF1 and ZF2 have been reported in AML-M5 (acute monocytic leukemia) (ref. 7) (Fig. 1b,c).
Train_Line_1933 Kirschner et al revealed the permissive role of WT1 gene on the expression of erythropoietin receptor in human erythroid progenitors.
Train_Line_1934 Mitochondrial DNA mutations leading to ringed sideroblastosis and up-regulation of mitochondrial-related genes in CD34+ cells have been demonstrated in patients with RARS-T.
Train_Line_1935 However, the clinical significance of this morphologic feature has been questioned.
Train_Line_1936 Diagnosis and predicted prognosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are largely determined by morphologic and clinical measures.
Train_Line_1937 Over 95% of PV patients carry the somatic JAK2 V617F mutation, whereby a guanine to thymidine transversion results in a nonsynonymous change of a valine to phenylalanine.
Train_Line_1938 In their studies of whole genome sequencing, Welch et al estimated that as few as 2 key somatic mutations are needed to cause the malignant founding clone and clinically manifest AML.
Train_Line_1939 Isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) encodes for the protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, an enzyme that participates in the citric acid cycle.
Train_Line_1940 Furthermore, 19 of 111 cases were also analyzed for DDX41 expression by TaqMan PCR (Figures 3F and 3G; Table S3).
Train_Line_1941 The frequency and prognostic impact of several of the new mutations are currently under investigation.
Train_Line_1942 There was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wild-type TET2 in the frequency of UPD or copy-number aberrations, suggesting that TET2 defects do not contribute to general genomic instability.
Train_Line_1943 Patients with germline RUNX1 mutations present with thrombocytopenia and frequent progression toward MDS/AML (Owen et al, 2008).
Train_Line_1944 DNMT3A and DNMT3B are the dominant DNA methyltransferases involved in de novo DNA methylation and act independent of replication, while DNMT1 acts predominantly during replication to maintain hemimethylated DNA, although their precise roles in cancer cells are less well defined.
Train_Line_1945 Interestingly, some of these mutations appear to be late events involved in disease progression because they were not found in the chronic phase.
Train_Line_1946 To investigate the origins of TET2 mutations and the selective advantage these lesions confer, we quantified the mutation load in CD34+ and CD3+ cells for 12 patients with TET2 mutations (Table 3).
Train_Line_1947 Similarly, in WHO-defined PV, the 10year projected rates for survival, leukemic transformation and fibrotic progression were >75%, <5%, and <10%, respectively.
Train_Line_1948 Any contradiction between the Kosmider MDS study and our own may, in part, be due to a relatively frequent transformation to AML in the non-TET2-mutated cases for the aforementioned study.
Train_Line_1949 For a better understanding of the pathophysiology of myelodysplasia, we summarized the current concepts in the model reported in Figure 2.
Train_Line_1950 It cannot be excluded, however, that JAK2V617F may give a significant advantage to HSC in specific conditions such as inflammation, as suggested by preliminary studies.
Train_Line_1951 The haplotype 46/1 is present with an allelic prevalence of approximately 10% in the normal populations and confers a 3- and a 1.4-fold increase in the risk of developing a JAK2V617F or exon 12 or a MPLW515 MPN, respectively.
Train_Line_1952 The mutation was more frequently detected in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) than in other FAB subtypes (P = .025; Table 1).
Train_Line_1953 Data processing and mutation calling were performed using Genomon-exome (http://genomon.hgc.jp/exome/en/index.html) as previously described.
Train_Line_1954 Our analysis confirms and extends these results by the finding that DNMT3A mutations also confer a negative prognosis in patients with wild-type FLT3 and wild-type NPM1.
Train_Line_1955 Even after accounting for these associations, older age remains an important predictor of poor outcome.
Train_Line_1956 This resulted in accelerated disease latency and increased disease burden in vivo, underscoring the biological importance of Asxl1 alterations in myeloid transformation.
Train_Line_1957 However, this association could be confounded by the fact that patients with normal cytogenetics and a TET2 mutation were older, and more likely to have CMML.
Train_Line_1958 In a review of 644 t-AML patients treated with various standard AML chemotherapy regimens, only 182 (28%) achieved a CR.
Train_Line_1959 WBC greater than 50 000/muL versus less than 50 000/muL.
Train_Line_1960 For CD34+ primary cells, we used 25 mg/ml of Retronectin instead of polybrene.
Train_Line_1961 We were unable to observe any mutation in these individuals.
Train_Line_1962 NRAS/KRAS MUTATIONS AND NF1 DELETION.
Train_Line_1963 The negative prognostic impact was also seen in multivariate analysis both for OS and time to AML progression, further supporting the idea that SRSF2 mutations represent an independent prognostic marker in MDS.
Train_Line_1964 The distribution of mutations in PTPN11 in Noonan syndrome with JMML also showed specificity, as four of five cases harbored the 218C>T mutations, which was observed in only 2% of PTPN11 defects in isolated Noonan syndrome.
Train_Line_1965 The most significant reduction in risk for all-cause mortality was observed in trials testing prophylaxis with quinolones, despite the occurrence of adverse effects and development of resistance.
Train_Line_1966 Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_1967 In MPNs, they are frequent in primary myelofibrosis (PMF)(34.5%) and rare in polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET).
Train_Line_1968 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) constitute one of five categories of myeloid malignancies, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for hematopoietic tumors (Table I).
Train_Line_1969 Table 1. Mutation patterns in 32 patients with WT1 mutations at diagnosis.
Train_Line_1970 The coexistence of TP53 mutations with other genomic aberrations might possibly be lethal to the cell, explaining the paucity of other mutations.
Train_Line_1971 Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV.
Train_Line_1972 Several compounds can modulate mRNA splicing, and a recent review article by Webb et al examines this topic comprehensively.
Train_Line_1973 Whether or not therapeutic targeting of mutant IDH or interfering with the production/function of its 'oncogenic' metabolite (i.e., 2-hydroxyglutarate) would favorably affect leukemic progression in primary myelofibrosis remains to be seen.
Train_Line_1974 This alteration was not found in 200 internal controls.
Train_Line_1975 Only EZH2 mutations retained prognostic significance in a multivariable model that included LR-PSS and other mutations (hazard ratio, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.85 to 4.52).
Train_Line_1976 Sunitinib is approved for treatment of GIST following relapse on imatinib.
Train_Line_1977 We show that they are mild loss of function mutations, they do not have a dominant-negative effect, and they can all still bind JAK2.
Train_Line_1978 Two main mechanisms of inhibition of C/EBPalpha protein translation have been reported. C/EBPalpha translation is inhibited in blasts from patients with CML myeloid blast crisis via an RNA binding protein, hnRNP-E2, which binds to the upstream open reading frame of the C/EBPalpha gene and inhibits translation of C/EBPalpha mRNA. hnRNP-E2 is induced by the oncogenic kinase BCR-ABL via a MAPK-dependent mechanism.
Train_Line_1979 As described previously, we identified 28 mutations of SF3B1 in our cohort.
Train_Line_1980 Socs3-/- mice die in utero due to fetal liver erythrocytosis and overexpression of SOCS3 blocks fetal liver erythrocytosis implying that SOCS3 plays a critical role in the negative regulation of definitive erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_1981 Whole-exome enrichment was performed with the use of the SureSelect Human All Exon kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_1982 LDH and WBC did not impact OS.
Train_Line_1983 "BCR-ABL1-negative MPN" is an operational sub-category of MPN that includes polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Train_Line_1984 These findings also suggest that a more expansive genomic screen for involvement of other components of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is warranted in MPD patients.
Train_Line_1985 Since no second generation drug is active on all of these mutants, this raises a possible need for use of drug combinations with potential complications due to toxicity and drug interactions.
Train_Line_1986 There is also evidence that secondary acquisition of TET2 mutations may be associated with disease progression and transformation.
Train_Line_1987 Cellular consequences of BRCC3 lesions.
Train_Line_1988 The promoter and exonic regions of C/EBPalpha meet the definition of a CpG island spanning almost 3.4 kb. Interestingly and similar to studies in hematopoietic cells, no methylation was found in the core promoter region.
Train_Line_1989 C/EBPalpha participates in the p53-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest in response to ultraviolet B radiation or chemotherapy.
Train_Line_1990 Table 7. Prognostic index for younger adults with AML in relapse.
Train_Line_1991 Association testing of germline polymorphisms was performed using the Fisher's exact or Chi-square tests.
Train_Line_1992 This score system divided these CN-AML patients into 3 groups with different survival (P < .001 for both OS and RFS; Figure 3).
Train_Line_1993 Notably, recurrent p.Leu359Val alteration in ZF2 of GATA2 was reported in 8 out of 85 individuals with CML blast crisis, a disease often phenotypically indistinguishable from AML.
Train_Line_1994 The average (mean) and standard deviation (SD) for relative mutation abundance (RMA) are shown and are based on a combined sequence coverage of > 500X.
Train_Line_1995 Signaling via RTKs is frequently deregulated in hematological malignancies.
Train_Line_1996 SHP-2 is implicated in signal transduction pathways, particularly those induced by growth factors; activation of SHP-2 generally leads to activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway.
Train_Line_1997 ASXL1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for survival.
Train_Line_1998 Bone marrow samples from 20 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; reported previously) were also analyzed.
Train_Line_1999 In the multivariable analyses, BCOR disruptive mutations did reveal an independent association with event-free survival in the Italian cohort (P = .04), but not with overall survival in the different patient groups (supplemental Table 14).
Train_Line_2000 This suggests that distinct molecular lesions probably contribute to the variable morphology and clinical outcome of these myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_2001 Exon 8 is an important mutation site in AML and results in small deletions/substitution usually involving D419.
Train_Line_2002 Their frequency in leukemic transformation is unknown.
Train_Line_2003 Sanger sequencing confirmation was performed in a selection of patients where the mutation had an abundance of >= 25%.
Train_Line_2004 Patients entered onto clinical trials of either standard or investigational therapy represent a very small, and likely biased, subset, and reported results overestimate the effectiveness of therapy in the general population of older AML.
Train_Line_2005 Indeed, clonal evolution of MDS is probably a multistep process in which several genetic events occur.
Train_Line_2006 The epigenetic regulation of DNA methylation of CpG islands is a complex, highly regulated process that involves both de novo methylation events as well as maintenance of post-replicative methylation from the parental strand template.
Train_Line_2007 Table I. Baseline clinical characteristics of patients in study cohort.
Train_Line_2008 This may explain why methylation of SOCS3 was observed in IMF but not in PV and also why methylation may only affect total SOCS3 mRNA level in JAK2 V617F-negative IMF patients.
Train_Line_2009 Taken together, these observations suggest that activation of SOCS1 transcription within MPD may be independent of activated JAK2/STAT5.
Train_Line_2010 In univariate analysis, older age, unfavorable cytogenetics, higher IPSS-R score, IDH, ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, EZH2 and SRSF2 mutations were poor prognostic factors for the OS (Supplementary Table 4).
Train_Line_2011 Index patients from family 1 were analyzed at diagnosis (and relapse).
Train_Line_2012 Of the 10 BCOR-mutated patients, 3 were reinvestigated for mutations in CEBPA, MLL-PTD, and IDH1.
Train_Line_2013 Within clinical trials, we strongly recommend storing patients' pretreatment leukemic marrow and blood within a biobank.
Train_Line_2014 Genomic DNA was extracted from samples using the All Prep DNA/RNA Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Train_Line_2015 A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Train_Line_2016 The structure of SOCS1 and the location of the CpG islands are shown in Figure 1A.
Train_Line_2017 Cytogenetic analysis was performed centrally by G- and R-banding analysis.
Train_Line_2018 LSK cells were infected with pLKO.1 lentivirus containing shRNAs targeting Brcc3 (Targeting sequences: shRNA, 5'-CCCACCCTCATATAACTGTTT-3') or negative control shRNA (Sigma, SHC002).
Train_Line_2019 For this reason, as previously suggested, PMF might be the accelerated phase of classic MPN.
Train_Line_2020 DSBs are associated with genomic instability, cell death and carcinogenesis.
Train_Line_2021 Somatic TET2 mutations were first described in patients with myeloid neoplasms in 2009.
Train_Line_2022 They then performed targeted sequencing of a large cohort of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and other myeloid cancers.
Train_Line_2023 The SF3B1 mutation status of 354 of the aforementioned 564 MDS patients, but not information on mutant allele burden or that on clinical significance of somatic mutation (impact on OS and contribution to the predictive power of IPSS or WPSS), was included in our previous report.
Train_Line_2024 Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in MDS patients stratified according to SF3B1 mutation status. (A) Overall survival, defined here as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis and the date of death (for patients who deceased) or last follow-up (for censored patients). (B) Leukemia-free survival (LFS), defined as the time between the date of diagnosis and the date of leukemic transformation (for patients who progressed to AML) or last follow-up. (C) Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time between the date of diagnosis and the date of first event (death or leukemic transformation) or last follow-up. Vertical tick marks indicate right-censored patients. Reproduced from Malcovati et al.
Train_Line_2025 BCORL1 mutations were the fourth most frequent molecular aberration after TP53 (40.9%), RUNX1 (27.3%), and U2AF35 (18.2%) mutations in AML-MRC.
Train_Line_2026 Here, we aimed to define the clinical correlations of SRSF2 mutation in patients with MDS and examine the interactions of this mutation with other genetic alternations.
Train_Line_2027 Given that the prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutation was greatest in lower risk patients, a Cox regression test limiting to patients with low or intermediate-1 risk disease was done; SRSF2 mutation was similarly not an independent prognostic factor for OS in this group of patients (supplemental Table 2).
Train_Line_2028 Whether mutations in TET2 create a permissive environment or provide a "mutator phenotype"35 for subsequent mutations, perhaps via alterations in the hydroxymethylome, remains to be seen.
Train_Line_2029 Recommendations.
Train_Line_2030 IDH2 mutations were associated with an improved rate of overall survival in the entire test cohort (3-year rate, 66%; P = 0.01) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2031 Patients were excluded if a tumor sample collected before transplantation was not available (34 patients) or if the sequencing assay could not be completed for their sample.
Train_Line_2032 METHODS.
Train_Line_2033 In one particular case with both MPL and TET2 mutations during chronic-phase ET, multiple TP53 mutations were identified at the time of post-ET-AML that resulted in an oligoclonal pattern in progenitors, with one selected subclone giving rise to leukemic blasts.
Train_Line_2034 The C-terminal peptide derived from alternative reading frame 1 contains a number of positively charged amino acids, whereas the nonmutant CALR C-terminal is largely negatively charged (Fig. 2B).
Train_Line_2035 Hgb or Hct >99th percentile of reference range for age, sex, or altitude of residence or red cell mass >25% above mean normal predicted or Hgb >17 g/dL (men)/>15 g/dL (women) if associated with a sustained increase of >=2 g/dL from baseline that cannot be attributed to correction of iron deficiency
Train_Line_2036 A particular challenge is to target tumour stem cells which seem to be especially refractory to KIT inhibition.
Train_Line_2037 Results were analyzed using CNAG (v3.0) (Nannya et al, 2005) or Genotyping Console (Affymetrix).
Train_Line_2038 The source of the DNA was bone marrow in the case of 55.2% of the samples (277 of 502) and peripheral blood in the case of 44.8% (225 of 502).
Train_Line_2039 Similar findings were noted in a study of Martis et al.
Train_Line_2040 The fact that these patients were untreated suggests that SF3B1 mutations may occur during disease development without necessarily being a result of chemotherapy-induced selective pressure.
Train_Line_2041 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_2042 For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for OS and time to progression to AML, adjusting for potential confounding covariates.
Train_Line_2043 FLT3-mutated MDS patients by IPSS: 1 patient had low risk (8%), 6 had intermediate-1 (50%), 4 had intermediate-2 (34%), and 1 had high-risk disease (8%).
Train_Line_2044 However, disease-prone germline variants of BRCC3 have not been reported so far.
Train_Line_2045 Multivariate analysis for OS, including mutations in SRSF2, ASXL1 (frameshift mutations), RUNX1, NRAS, and IDH1, as well as transfusion dependence and IPSS risk group, revealed that the presence of SRSF2 mutations was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.3; 95% CI, 1.28-4.13; P = .017; Table 2).
Train_Line_2046 In a similar model considering the LR-PSS risk categories in place of age and the IPSS risk groups, only EZH2 mutations remained as a significant predictor of shorter overall survival (HR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.85 to 4.52; Fig 3) in addition to LR-PSS risk group.
Train_Line_2047 These findings suggest that ASXL1 mutation may constitute an early hit in the pathogenesis of MDS.
Train_Line_2048 In patients with IDH mutations, those with IDH2, but not IDH1, mutation had shorter OS than those without (median, 18.5 vs. 31.3 months, P = 0.039, Fig. 1B).
Train_Line_2049 Although single-donor platelets are often thought preferable to platelets obtained from multiple donors, a randomized trial showed that they were no more effective in reducing alloimmunization or refractoriness to transfusions.
Train_Line_2050 Advent of hypomethylating agents, improved supportive care, and better transplant options for MDS post-2005 may be responsible for the improved survival noted in the FLT3-mutated MDS patients.
Train_Line_2051 Furthermore, in PV, the JAK2 V617F mutation arises in a very early hematopoietic progenitor with both myeloid and lymphoid potential.
Train_Line_2052 For prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases, prevailing institutional infectious organisms and their drug-resistance pattern should primarily be considered.
Train_Line_2053 When this collaboration was established in the first months of 2010, it was decided to perform whole-exome sequencing studies in patients with MDS, and more specifically in those with myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_2054 Rarely, however, ring sideroblasts are observed in these patients, and this is reflected in the low incidence of SF3B1 mutations observed in this study.
Train_Line_2055 U2AF1 mutations were slightly less frequent and ZRSR2 mutations were relatively rare.
Train_Line_2056 In contrast, very few studies have looked into this matter in chronic myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_2057 This cohort included 382 patients with polycythemia vera, 311 with essential thrombocythemia, and 203 with primary myelofibrosis (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2058 TP53 mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome are strongly correlated with aberrations of chromosome 5, and correlate with adverse prognosis.
Train_Line_2059 EZH1 and EZH2 proteins (enhancer of zeste homolog) belong to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).
Train_Line_2060 PCR-product subcloning and sequencing revealed that Patient H_0191 had a 52-bp de letion and Patient H_0296 had a 1-bp deletion (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2061 Sequential studies in 151 patients demonstrated that all IDH-mutated patients retained the same mutation during disease evolution while none of the IDH-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during follow-ups.
Train_Line_2062 The degree of acceptability of administering standard induction therapy depends greatly on cytogenetics.
Train_Line_2063 In addition, the nonmutant calreticulin contains the endoplasmic reticulum-retention motif at the C-terminal end (lysine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and leucine [KDEL] amino acid sequence).
Train_Line_2064 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_2065 Subsequent analysis of acquired sequence alterations also revealed the concomitant presence of a canonical somatic mutation of DDX41 (c.G1574A, p.R525H) in the father and son (Figure 1A; Figure S1A).
Train_Line_2066 To that end DDX41 is exemplary of other DEAD/H-box helicases that are also mutated in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_2067 Sequencing products were analyzed with the use of a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_2068 Mouse models show that these fusion genes rarely cause overt leukemia on their own unless complemented by class I mutations.
Train_Line_2069 TA-cloning analysis.
Train_Line_2070 Mutation: A change of the nucleotide sequence of the genome.
Train_Line_2071 For Flt3-TKD mutations, additional improvement of event-free survival has been described for patients with C/EBPalpha mutations.
Train_Line_2072 For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for OS and AML transformation adjusting for potential confounding covariates.
Train_Line_2073 Older age and comorbidities typical of patients with MDS are frequently associated with unacceptable risk of early death after transplantation.
Train_Line_2074 Higher mutation abundance in total bone marrow than CD34+ cells, consistent with a genomic aberration rendering the TET2 locus hemizygous after differentiation.
Train_Line_2075 Karyotype risk designation and risk stratification were according to the revised IPSS-R.
Train_Line_2076 Here we describe the clinical, biological, and therapeutic relevance of mutations in epigenetic regulators in AML.
Train_Line_2077 Potential implications of SF3B1 mutations for molecular diagnosis and prognosis of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.
Train_Line_2078 The mutations detected at the highest frequency affected the splicing machinery (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1) in 6 patients, while 2 patients showed an early dominance for RUNX1 and RUNX1 and TET2, respectively.
Train_Line_2079 Multivariate survival analyses were performed by Cox proportional hazards regression.
Train_Line_2080 Eleven of 12 of our FLT3 MDS patients had RAEB.
Train_Line_2081 Number of patients (%).
Train_Line_2082 Among the 32 patients with WT1 mutations, 23 (72%) showed additional molecular abnormalities at diagnosis (Table 4); 16 had one additional change, 6 had 2, and 1 had 3.
Train_Line_2083 The model for the entire cohort identified mutations in TP53 and TET2 as independent predictors of OS.
Train_Line_2084 The mechanisms of C/EBPalpha-mediated growth arrest include interaction with CDK2/CDK4, upregulation of p21waf1/cip1 and the SWI/SNF chromatinremodelling complex as well as direct inhibition of the E2F complex.
Train_Line_2085 TP53 alterations are the most common molecular lesions in CK-AML and predict for resistance to conventional chemotherapy and dismal outcome.
Train_Line_2086 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_2087 Furthermore, in one knockin model, JAK2V617F HSCs were at a disadvantage.
Train_Line_2088 Moreover, we did not detect GATA2 mutations in 8 MDS-AML families in which RUNX1 and CEPBA mutations had been excluded and 27 families presenting with lymphoid malignancy.
Train_Line_2089 In addition, two recently identified somatic mutations are most common in patients with post-MPN AML.
Train_Line_2090 Figure 3. BCOR mRNA and protein expression in AML patients carrying BCOR disruptive mutations. (A) Box plots of BCOR mRNA levels quantified by real-time RT-PCR in 5 primary AML patients with BCOR disruptive mutations introducing premature stop codons (before the second last exon) compared with 14 BCOR-unmutated AML patients. All of the 5 BCOR-mutated AML patients display substantially decreased BCOR mRNA levels (P = .006 by Wilcoxon 2-sample test of delta-Ct values). (B) Western blot analysis of BCOR protein expression in normal donor CD34+ hematopoietic cells (CD34+ I and CD34+ II, left panels) and in primary AML cells isolated from 15 patients with wild-type BCOR gene (right panels) showing a specific protein band of variable intensity corresponding to full-length BCOR (192 kDa predicted MW; arrow). (C) Western blot analysis of primary AML cells isolated from 5 patients harboring BCOR disruptive mutations (labeled in red: patient 326 with Thr733AlafsX5; patient 406II with Asn1485LysfsX5; patient 258A with Leu245ThrfsX19; patient 447A with Pro1115ThrfsX41; and patient 644A with His674MetfsX41). As a comparison, full-length BCOR expression in lysates from further 4 AML patients (patients 226, 157, 309, and 409) all devoid of BCOR mutations is shown. In the top panels, a specific protein band corresponding to full-length BCOR (192 kDa predicted MW) is observed (arrow) in wild-type BCOR AML, but not in BCOR-mutated AML. In patient 406II, a new faint band is detected (arrowhead) that likely corresponds to a truncated BCOR protein (162 kDa predicted MW). (B-C) The OCI/AML3 cell line not carrying BCOR mutations was used as a positive control for full-length BCOR protein expression. Protein lysate loading was evaluated by blotting the membranes with an anti-NPM1 or anti-beta-tubulin Ab. Vertical lines have been inserted to indicate repositioned gel lanes.
Train_Line_2091 METHODS.
Train_Line_2092 This group showed that the D816H substitution also destabilises the interaction of the JMD with the kinase domain.
Train_Line_2093 Most of these patients did not have a complex karyotype and were not more likely to have an elevated bone marrow blast percentage before transplantation.
Train_Line_2094 C/EBPs are modular proteins consisting of two transactivation domains, a dimerization leucine zipper region, and a DNA-binding domain.
Train_Line_2095 Recently developed technologies to map 5hmC occupancy on a genome-wide scale, and to resolve 5hmC from 5mC at a single nucleotide base resolution level will hopefully help to determine the effect of TET2 mutations on 5mC, 5hmC, and the relationship of these modified bases to gene transcription.
Train_Line_2096 IDH mutations are stable during the clinical course.
Train_Line_2097 Cytogenetics and SNP Arrays.
Train_Line_2098 Figure 1 provides a practical diagnostic algorithm that begins with peripheral blood mutation screening for JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_2099 We then examined possible prognostic value of having none of these mutations (n = 104) vs. otherwise (n = 123) and the results were again negative (P = 0.87).
Train_Line_2100 Indeed, the JAK2V617F mutation has been found in the majority of BCR-ABL-negative MPNs (~95% of patients with PV, 50%-70% with ET, and 40%-50% with PMF), as well as in some cases of atypical MPN (30%-50% splanchnic vein thrombosis and sideroblastic anemia associated with a thrombocytosis).
Train_Line_2101 This criterion provides a measure of the relative goodness of fit of a statistical model and a means for comparison among models, a lower Akaike information criterion value indicating a better trade-off between fit and complexity.
Train_Line_2102 In particular, TP53 mutated subclones may occur at an early disease stage in MDS with del(5q), where they are associated with a lower response to lenalidomide and an increased risk of progression to AML.
Train_Line_2103 By contrast, IDH1 mutation has been found to be associated with a short leukemia-free survival in MDS.
Train_Line_2104 Further risk factors include cytomegalovirus (CMV) serum status of recipient and donor, and non-HLA genetics, that is, SNPs or microsatellites of cytokines, cytokine receptor genes, or genes associated with innate immunity.
Train_Line_2105 Whether EZH2 inactivation may have therapeutic efficacy in other subtypes of AML or in other myeloid malignancies has not been studied.
Train_Line_2106 A total of 8 somatic mutations could be identified including BCOR, RUNX1, and STAG2, which have recently been identified in hematopoietic malignancies.
Train_Line_2107 Four of 12 AML-M6 patients in this study had WT1 mutations.
Train_Line_2108 Positive cells (103) were plated in triplicates in semisolid methylcellulose (MethoCult GF M3434; Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).
Train_Line_2109 IDH1 mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
Train_Line_2110 At a median follow-up period of 8 years, there was not significant difference in the risk of leukemic transformation (2% vs. 1.4%), non-hematologic malignancy (2.8% vs. 5%), vascular complications (27% vs. 37%), or transformation into post-PV MF (4.8% vs. 4.1%) between the two arms.
Train_Line_2111 Four children shared a C>T transition at position 218, predicting a T73I substitution.
Train_Line_2112 WHOLE-EXOME SEQUENCING.
Train_Line_2113 Patients.
Train_Line_2114 The median survival of patients with a mutation was 433 days compared to 965 days for patients without a mutation (Table 1, log-rank p=0.005).
Train_Line_2115 This was the case also in our study, mainly because of the strict collinearity between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations.
Train_Line_2116 The statistical results of WT1 and PTPN11 mutations were not listed because only one patient each harbored the mutations at diagnosis.
Train_Line_2117 Non-hematologic DNAs were available for nine individuals with a mutation in PTPN11 in their leukemic cells, and none harbored that defect.
Train_Line_2118 At present there is no known inhibitor that is active on all observed KIT secondary mutants.
Train_Line_2119 Purified polymerase chain reaction fragments were directly sequenced using forward or reverse primers, and the sequences were compared with the DNMT3A coding sequence available from the Ensembl genome database (transcript DNMT3A-001 ENST00000264709).
Train_Line_2120 Mandatory in patients with a dry tap (punctio sicca).
Train_Line_2121 Multiparameter flow cytometric studies were consistent with AML.
Train_Line_2122 This is most commonly attained by the activating JAK2 V617F mutation which is found in more than 90% of patients with polycythaemia vera and approximately 50% of patients with essential thrombocythaemia and primary myelofibrosis (Baxter et al 2005; James et al 2005; Jones et al 2005; Kralovics et al 2005; Levine et al 2005).
Train_Line_2123 Ninety (85%) of the ASXL1-mutated patients had concurrently other gene mutations (Supplementary Table 1 and Table 2).
Train_Line_2124 Of note, clonal dominance occurs at the HSC level in PMF that frequently carry several mutations.
Train_Line_2125 Figure 1. Germline and Somatic Mutations of Three Families with History of MDS and Leukemia. (A-C) Pedigrees of family 1 (A), family 2 (B), and family 3 (C) (upper panels). Age of diagnosis and detected DDX41 mutations are indicated. Lower panels show sequencing reads from WES with frequencies of detected mutations in bone marrow (BM) and germline samples. Confirmation of germline and somatic DDX41 mutations by Sanger sequencing is exemplarily shown for family 2 (B). Arrows and bars indicate the specific nucleotide and predicted codon, respectively. Case number is annotated according to Table 1. Asymptomatic/presymptomatic carrier is clinically unaffected at this time but could later exhibit symptoms (Bennett et al., 2008). See also Figure S1.
Train_Line_2126 The Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group (HOVON) and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) showed priming with G-CSF resulted in a significantly better DFS, and in the intermediate-risk group also a significantly better OS.
Train_Line_2127 As has been the case in many genetic diseases and in other human cancers, exome sequencing has led to an important new insight into the genetic basis of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_2128 It is thus conceivable that JAK2V617F HSC remain harmless during a long period, until genetic or environmental changes such as hematopoietic stress or aging allow clonal dominance and MPN emergence.
Train_Line_2129 8.2 Patients age 75 or older.
Train_Line_2130 We analyzed 91 cases with no previous history of hematologic malignancy, using SNP 6.0 arrays.
Train_Line_2131 TABLE IV. Risk Stratification in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia and Risk-Adopted Therapy.
Train_Line_2132 Association of WT1 mutations with cytogenetic abnormalities.
Train_Line_2133 The validation cohort (104 patients) comprised a second set of patients for whom samples were banked in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), which was used to extract DNA for mutational studies.
Train_Line_2134 Indirect evidence supporting the hypothesis that DNA methylation changes may be important in AML and MDS genomes comes from the observation that cytosine analog drugs that interfere with methylation (5-azacytidine and decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine)) have clinical activity in these diseases.
Train_Line_2135 Examining 2657 Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 in American Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries, Menzin et al found that 70% did not receive "chemotherapy," ranging from 56% of patients age 65 to 74, to 94% of patients age 85 or older.
Train_Line_2136 Recent data indicate a median survival of GIST patients with advanced disease of 5 years with 34% of patients alive for > 9 years.
Train_Line_2137 The U2 auxiliary factor that consists of the U2AF65-U2AF35 heterodimer, establishes physical interaction with SF1 and a serine/arginine rich protein such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, resulting in recognition of the 30 splice site and its nearby polypyrimidine tract.
Train_Line_2138 Gamma irradiation (at least 25 Gy) is the only reliable method to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD.
Train_Line_2139 Significantly, 90% of the mutations identified here were previously uncharacterized.
Train_Line_2140 One of these patients had an identical mutation in IDH1 codon 132 at the time of MDS (refractory anemia) and in the follow-up sample at the time of AML transformation 2.7 years later.
Train_Line_2141 [END OF ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS].
Train_Line_2142 The median follow-up of patients alive was 3 years.
Train_Line_2143 PURPOSE.
Train_Line_2144 Number of patients (% of patients with or without IDH mutation in the subgroup).
Train_Line_2145 However, the patients with WT1 mutations had a higher incidence of relapse than those without (85.7% vs 51.1%, P = .002; Table 2).
Train_Line_2146 For the remaining patients with CNAML (intermediate-I) and those with intermediate-II karyotypes (Table 4), repetitive cycles of HiDAC (3-4 cycles; 3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 3, and 5) are currently widely used by many cooperative groups; however, outcome for most of the subsets remains unsatisfactory.
Train_Line_2147 Despite the success of imatinib therapy, approximately half of the patients with metastatic disease develop resistance within 2 years, and as in the case of BCR/ABL in CML, this is almost always due to a second mutation in the same allele of KIT as the primary mutation.
Train_Line_2148 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_2149 The median follow-up time for patients alive was calculated according to the method of Korn.
Train_Line_2150 The chi-square test or Fisher exact test were performed to calculate the significance of association between U2AF1 mutation and other parameters of discrete variables, including sex, FAB subtypes, WHO classification, karyotypes, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores and mutations of other genes.
Train_Line_2151 These include mutations involving; RUNX1, IDH1, and IDH2, KRAS and NRAS, CBL, JAK2, TET2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, UTX, and EZH2.
Train_Line_2152 Strongly encouraged in AML with normal karyotype.
Train_Line_2153 Primers were designed using the MethPrimer program.
Train_Line_2154 Likewise, a significantly higher proportion of CMML cases (46%) in our cohort carried the TET2 mutation (Table 1), compared with other World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes (12%; P < .001).
Train_Line_2155 Overall and leukemia-free survival curves were prepared by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.

Train_Line_2157 Beginning with the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation, multiple additional mutations have been found which constitutively activate cell-signaling pathways, including MPL, CBL, and LNK.
Train_Line_2158 We identified and verified 4 additional mutations with an RMA of 3%-6.3% (Figure 3A).
Train_Line_2159 The quantified frequency of BCOR mutations affected mononuclear BM cells with a range of 13.5% to 79% (Figure 2 and supplemental Table 7).

Train_Line_2161 Table 2. Thirty-four IDH mutation types detected among 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and their corresponding karyotype and WHO histological and IPSS-R risk categories.
Train_Line_2162 While KIT is now known to also be expressed in other tissues, for example, vascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, renal tubules, breast glandular epithelial cells and sweat glands, recurrent mutations have not been described in corresponding cancers and early studies have generally failed to show efficacy of KIT inhibitors in these cancers.
Train_Line_2163 Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to plot survival curves and log-rank tests were used to test the differences between groups.
Train_Line_2164 Some studies suggest a negative impact on patient outcome, whereas others find no independent influence on survival.
Train_Line_2165 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_2166 The primer pair for exon6 was: U2AF1_exon6v4F: AAG TCT TAT TAA AGC GTG GAT GGC/U2AF1_exon6R: ACG TCA CTG GCC ACT CCT CAC TCA C.
Train_Line_2167 ASXL1 mutations are further detected in rare cases of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) and in RARS-T.
Train_Line_2168 However, to accelerate progress in research the panel strongly recommends entry of AML patients on clinical trials, and storage of biosamples to enable correlative laboratory studies.
Train_Line_2169 Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in MDS patients stratified according to SF3B1 mutation status. (A) OS. (B) LFS. (C) EFS. Vertical tick-marks indicate right-censored patients.
Train_Line_2170 Animals were humanely killed when they had palpable splenomegaly or were moribund.
Train_Line_2171 The mutation frequency in primary MDS and tMDS/AML were 8.1% (24/296) and 27.3% (6/22) respectively (Table I).
Train_Line_2172 Notably, in most of these studies, the type of postremission treatment was not taken into account in the analysis of clinical outcome.
Train_Line_2173 Risk Stratification.
Train_Line_2174 In vivo expression of the JAK2 V617F mutant protein results in erythrocytosis and eventual myelofibrotic transformation in mouse models demonstrating the crucial pathogenetic role that the JAK2 V617F mutation plays in MPD.
Train_Line_2175 These questions will need to be addressed using larger cohorts of patients that are comprehensively genotyped for mutations in all the genes.
Train_Line_2176 Moreover, BCOR mutations were associated with a decrease in BCOR mRNA levels, an absence of full-length BCOR protein, and a lack or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein.
Train_Line_2177 Three rounds of replating were performed for each experiment (Sontakke et al, 2014; He et al, 2011).
Train_Line_2178 Number of patients (%).
Train_Line_2179 This is theoretically possible, but less likely than the transition reported in Figure 5, because it would imply that a JAK2 (V617F)-mutated/SF3B1-mutated subclone has a competitive advantage over a JAK2 (V617F)-mutated dominant clone.
Train_Line_2180 Phenotypically, BRCC3 mutations were identified in the low- (13 of 652; 2.0%) and high- (11 of 427; 2.6%) risk MDS groups and in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) (3 of 94; 3.2%), but not in any sAML and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) cases (Table 2).
Train_Line_2181 Treatment should be started immediately because delays may compromise maternal outcome.
Train_Line_2182 However, downregulation of SETD2 is unlikely due to epigenetic silencing, as we found no hypermethylation of SETD2 promoter DNA in 194 AMLs from the DNA methylation data set derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA; Supplementary Fig. 10d,e).
Train_Line_2183 Recently, a new gene mutation in the additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) gene has been found in 11% of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_2184 No SF3B1 mutation was detected in 156 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Train_Line_2185 In GIST, treatment with imatinib results in disease control but not eradication and drug resistance frequently develops due to secondary mutation in KIT resulting in loss of drug binding.
Train_Line_2186 Functional studies may clarify whether mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 have distinct effects on leukemic progression from MDS to AML.
Train_Line_2187 It should be noted that the subgroup of patients with an MPL mutation was small.
Train_Line_2188 Three days of an anthracycline (eg, daunorubicin, at least 60 mg/m2 [higher doses are being explored], idarubicin, 10-12 mg/m2, or the anthracenedione mitoxantrone, 10-12 mg/m2) and 7 days of cytarabine (100-200 mg/m2 continuous IV) ("3 + 7") currently remains the standard for induction therapy.
Train_Line_2189 More generally, the identification of the biologic pathways that are activated by mutation might allow personalized treatment in the individual patient with myelodysplasia.
Train_Line_2190 TABLE II. Comparison of Cytogenetic Changes Between MDS Patients with and without IDH Mutation.
Train_Line_2191 Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders with a high propensity to transform into acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_2192 In SRSF2, codon P95 located in exon 1 was most frequently mutated (n = 18), leading to a change from proline to leucine (n = 7), arginine (n = 6), or histidine (n = 5).
Train_Line_2193 Whole-genome amplification of DNA for each sample was performed using the REPLI-g kit from Qiagen (Venlo, the Netherlands).
Train_Line_2194 Therefore, the analysis for BCOR mutations may improve the capabilities for prognostication in CN-AML, and its clinical value should be further investigated in larger studies.
Train_Line_2195 Loss of SOCS activity induces excess signaling by cytokines.
Train_Line_2196 In haemopoietic malignancies, as well as germ cell tumours, the main region of mutation is exon 17 which encodes the activation loop of the kinase domain.
Train_Line_2197 NGS technology has recently been used to sequence the complete genome of a person with AML, primarily confirming aberrations in known disease-associated genes.
Train_Line_2198 Overview: Imatinib Resistance.
Train_Line_2199 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_2200 In this perspective article, we examine the biologic and clinical significance of mutations in SF3B1, a gene that encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b protein complex, in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.
Train_Line_2201 Age >=60 years and history of thrombosis are the two risk factors used to classify patients with PV or ET into low (0 risk factors) and high (1 or 2 risk factors) risk groups (Table IV).
Train_Line_2202 The diseases are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that leads to marrow failure and a propensity to transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_2203 The patient cohorts studied thus far are heterogeneous, and all studies are basically retrospective.
Train_Line_2204 Mutations in specific genes have been associated with adverse prognostic features in patients with MDS, including elevated blast proportion and complex karyotype.
Train_Line_2205 Activating mutations of KIT are now known to occur in almost all cases of systemic mastocytosis (SM) and are often present in other haemopoietic lineages in these patients indicating that the target may be in the stem cell compartment.
Train_Line_2206 Late obstetric complications as well as maternal thrombohemorrhagic events are relatively infrequent and platelet count usually decreases substantially during the second and third trimesters.
Train_Line_2207 In addition to participating in the splicing process, SRSF2 is also involved in the regulation of DNA stability.
Train_Line_2208 A cytogenetic sub-group analysis was performed in patients with complex cytogenetics (n = 67) with or without mutations of TP53, and showed that patients with mutation had a worse OS (8 vs. 14 months, P < 0.001) and PFS (8 vs. 14 months, P < 0.001) compared to those with wild type TP53 (Fig 3C).
Train_Line_2209 These include inhibitors of bromodomains (recently reviewed in Dawson et al), mutant IDH1 and IDH2 proteins, and selective competitive antagonists of the enzymes EZH2, LSD1, and DOT1L (Table 1).
Train_Line_2210 However, mutated TP53 have been found with a 20% frequency in post-MPN-AML patients.
Train_Line_2211 The mechanism of C/EBPalpha-mutant leukemogenesis has been addressed in homozygous knock-in mice that express p30 C/EBPalpha but lack p42 C/EBPalpha completely.
Train_Line_2212 Cytotoxic agents implicated in therapy-related hematologic neoplasms: alkylating agents; ionizing radiation therapy; topoisomerase II inhibitors; others.
Train_Line_2213 Most important, these data indicate that more detailed genetic analysis may lead to improved risk stratification and identification of patients who can benefit from more intensive induction chemotherapy.
Train_Line_2214 Recurrent mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 are found in AML and MDS.
Train_Line_2215 As is apparent from the many new induction therapies being studied in older patients, it is easier to recognize that a patient needs investigational therapy than it is to specify what that therapy should be.
Train_Line_2216 It has been also reported that LNK exon 2 mutations can be found in pure erythrocytosis.
Train_Line_2217 This conclusion was totally unpredictable since, as emphasized by Vogelstein et al, a spliceosome mutation was expected to lead to a plethora of nonspecific cellular abnormalities rather than to promote clonal proliferation.
Train_Line_2218 Mutations have been shown to be present in the HSC/progenitor populations.
Train_Line_2219 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_2220 JAK2 phosphorylates the arginine methyltransferase, PMRT5.
Train_Line_2221 TP53 alterations are associated with older age, genomic complexity, specific DNA copy number alterations, MK, and dismal outcome.
Train_Line_2222 In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%.
Train_Line_2223 Six genetic variations were detected including p.P242S, p.W262R, p.Q423X, p.A536T, p.R551W, and p.I568T (Fig. 1).
Train_Line_2224 In addition, sequential analysis of IDH mutations to evaluate their dynamic changes during MDS progression is scanty in literature.
Train_Line_2225 Double-stranded labeled probes (100 fmol) were incubated with 3 mug of nuclear extract for 20 min in 1x binding buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 muM ZnSO4, 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 0.1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mM EDTA and 5 mug/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA.
Train_Line_2226 In addition, strain-specific variations were observed in the retroviral mouse model, suggesting that host modifier genes were involved in the phenotype of the disease.
Train_Line_2227 However, methylation of SOCS1 exon 2 region was observed in 53% (18/34) of normal individuals (in all cell types assessed) and in 38% (28/73) of MPD patients (Figure 1C, Table 1).
Train_Line_2228 Overall survival was calculated from the time of sample collection to the time of death from any cause.
Train_Line_2229 Bone marrow examination is not essential for the diagnosis of PV because patients who otherwise fulfill the diagnostic criteria for PV are labeled as having PV even if they display substantial bone marrow fibrosis (Table II).
Train_Line_2230 Incuded 20 s AML and 1 tMDS/AML patient with >30% blasts and also 15 patients with proliferative CMML or MDS/MPD-U.
Train_Line_2231 Ayalew Tefferi.
Train_Line_2232 Recently, the role of gene mutations was taken into account for risk stratification and it is getting clear that certain gene mutations have prognostic relevance in MDS.
Train_Line_2233 These can broadly be divided into four categories: mutations involving epigenetic regulator genes such as EZH2, ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1, and IDH2, mutations involving the spliceosome machinery such as SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35, ZRSR2, SF3A1, PRPF40B, U2AF65, and SF1, mutations involving DNA damage response genes such as Tp53, and mutations involving genes regulating cellular/receptor tyrosine kinases and transcription factors such as JAK2, KRAS, NRAS, and RUNX1.
Train_Line_2234 In conclusion, SRSF2 mutation is associated with distinct clinical and biologic features in MDS patients.
Train_Line_2235 There was no survival difference between the patients with and without IDH mutation in the higher-risk group (median, 18.5 months vs. 10.8 months, P = 0.459 by IPSS, Fig. 1D; median, 18.6 months vs. 15.0 months, P = 0.576 by IPSS-R, and median, 18.5 months vs. 15.2 months, P = 0.990 by FAB classification).
Train_Line_2236 When considering only frameshift mutations, the negative prognostic influence on OS was even more pronounced (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.21 to 3.50; P = .008; Table 3; Fig 1B).
Train_Line_2237 Figure 1. Distribution of mutations in PTPN11 in myeloid disease and Noonan syndrome and their functional effects. (a) Phosphatase assays with wild-type and mutant SHP-2 proteins. Mean and standard deviations of phosphate released using wild-type (WT), N308D (most recurrent Noonan syndrome mutant), D61Y and E76K (two mutants most commonly occurring in JMML), and C459G (catalytically inactive mutant) proteins (above) and representative immunoblot (IB) of the immunoprecipitates using antibody to V5 in the phosphatase assays, loaded into 8% polyacrylamide gels (below). Statistical significance of differences in protein tyrosine phosphatase activity between the N308D, D61Y and E76K SHP-2 mutants and wild-type SHP-2 is reported (*P <= 0.005; ** P < 0.001). (b) Proliferation rates of cells expressing wild-type and mutant SHP-2 proteins. Mean and standard deviations of BrdU uptake of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with constructs encoding wild-type (WT; n = 23), N308D (n = 23), D61Y (n = 22), E76K (n = 22) and C459G (n = 22) proteins, cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum for 30 h. Significance of differences in proliferation rates between cells expressing the N308D, D61Y and E76K SHP-2 mutants and wild-type SHP-2 is reported (*P = 0.01; **P < 0.001).

The panels show a representative autoradiograph of the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP), the substrate of the kinase reaction, and immunoblots using antibodies to hemagglutinin (HA; ERK2), to V5 (SHP-2) and to FLAG (GAB1) of the immunoprecipitates (IP) or wholecell lysates, loaded in 8% polyacrylamide gels. (d) Schematic representation of SHP-2 showing the distribution of mutations and their relative prevalence in JMML, MDS and AML (above) and in Noonan syndrome (below).
Train_Line_2238 The genetic analyses were performed as part of CALGB companion protocols 8361 and 8765, which procured blood and bone marrow samples prospectively on patients entered on CALGB treatment studies.
Train_Line_2239 Plat-E cells were transfected with the MIG vectors, and viral supernatants were collected after 48 h. 293T cells were transfected with the MIG vectors in conjunction with pGag-Pol and RD114 Env as previously described (Cosset et al 1995).
Train_Line_2240 In mice, altered DNMTs have variable effects on cancer.
Train_Line_2241 Recently described IDH mutations encode proteins that have deficient activity in this regard, but express neomorphic catalytic activity in converting a-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate.
Train_Line_2242 FoxA2 appears to be a major mediator of the growthinhibiting action of C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_2243 The total number of variants identified in the tumor (16105), including the ones not previously reported (2720) and the known SNPs (reported in dbSNP 130), was similar to other estimates using different capture and sequencing platforms, including the one used in this study (supplemental Table 3), testifying to the sensitivity (proportion of true variants identified) of the SAVI algorithm.
Train_Line_2244 Candidate somatic variants (present in the tumor but not in its paired normal DNA) that were nonsynonymous or affected the consensus splice site (ie, the 4 nucleotides surrounding the exon-intron boundary) were verified by PCR amplification and direct DNA sequencing of the corresponding regions in the index patient (primers available on request).
Train_Line_2245 One mutant clone out of 40 was detected.
Train_Line_2246 Products were purified before sequencing.
Train_Line_2247 With respect to clinical implications, they concluded that SF3B1 mutations are associated with a poor prognosis in CLL, because a Cox multivariate regression model revealed that an SF3B1 mutation was predictive of an earlier need for treatment independently of other established predictive factors.
Train_Line_2248 Given the dismal results after conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic HSCT from either matched related or unrelated donors in CR1 is therefore considered a reasonable treatment option for patients with unfavorable cytogenetics.
Train_Line_2249 In the present study, we investigated the frequency and prognostic influence of mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 in the context of other prognostic clinical and molecular markers in a cohort of 193 MDS patients.
Train_Line_2250 PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_2251 ASXL1 can act as a transcriptional activator or corepressor of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) activity, depending on cellular context.
Train_Line_2252 At present, the most important prognostic factors in MDS are WHO category, cytogenetic abnormality, and transfusion requirement or severity of anemia, all of which are included in the WPSS.
Train_Line_2253 HEK293 cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant GATA2 using Lipofectamine 2000.
Train_Line_2254 Table III. The variation of TP53 mutant clone size pre- and post-initiation of treatment with 5-azacitidine or lenalidomide.
Train_Line_2255 In this study, mutated IDH1 was an independent unfavorable prognostic marker for both event-free survival and overall survival of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_2256 Abnormal sequencing results were confirmed by at least 2 repeated analyses.
Train_Line_2257 Additionally, a 36bp C-terminal C/EBPalpha gene duplication was found in the leukemic samples of one of the siblings.
Train_Line_2258 A prerequisite for success for such a transplant strategy is rapid identification of a suitable matched donor.
Train_Line_2259 To clarify the functional consequences of BRCC3 defects, lentiviral shRNA mediated knockdown of Brcc3 expression was performed in mouse lineage-Sca-1+c-kit+ (LSK) cells, which are enriched for hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells.
Train_Line_2260 Viral supernatants were harvested at 48, 72, and 96 hr post-transfection, and target cells were infected in the presence of 8 mg/ml polybrene for 24 hr and selected with puromycin (2 mg/ml for K562 and 1 mg/ml for HL60).
Train_Line_2261 In our study, SF3B1 mutation remained an independent predictor of better survival even after adjustment for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk, whereas its significance was borderline after adjustment for the WHO classification-based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) risk.
Train_Line_2262 In SM co-operating oncogenic stimuli also appear to be necessary for transformation.
Train_Line_2263 BRCC3 codes for a component of two complexes, BRCA1-A and BRISC.
Train_Line_2264 Mutational analyses.
Train_Line_2265 LNK plays an important role in hematopoiesis by negatively regulating JAK2 activation through its SH2 domain, thus inhibiting EPO-R and MPL signaling.
Train_Line_2266 We also performed mutant-allele burden quantification of sorted cells from patient UPN3 (supplemental Table 7 and Figure 2).
Train_Line_2267 Disease overview: Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively.
Train_Line_2268 In myelodysplastic syndromes, SF3B1 mutations appear to be founding genetic lesions and are associated with a low risk of leukemic evolution.
Train_Line_2269 Subgroup analyses showed that the presence of IDH mutations predicted shorter OS only in the subgroup of patients with lower-risk MDS, but not in the higher risk group.
Train_Line_2270 Mutations in TET2, ASXL1, and EZH2 genes are observed in a wide range of myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_2271 Overall, 21% of patients carried one or more mutations in these genes, indicating that more than one fifth of patients categorized as having lower-risk MDS by the IPSS have mutations associated with worse prognosis.
Train_Line_2272 In a sub-cohort of 154 patients (48% of entire cohort), additional screening for another 21 selected molecular markers that are mutated in MDS was performed on BM total nucleated cell DNA using the Roche GS FLX platform as described previously (Smith et al 2010).
Train_Line_2273 Two patients had somatic deletions in exon 9 of CALR.
Train_Line_2274 However, little is currently known about the clinical course, morphologic features, prognostic impact, and concomitant molecular aberrations of MDS patients harboring SRSF2, ZRSR2, or U2AF35 mutations.
Train_Line_2275 In MPN, this question remains unresolved because NRAS mutations were found in post-MPN-AML blasts and in cells from the preceding chronic phase, but also, in some patients, exclusively in AML blasts at transformation.
Train_Line_2276 The study enrolled 518 patients with PV in a double-blind randomized trial to low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) or placebo.
Train_Line_2277 We also measured SOCS1 and/or SOCS3 transcript levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal individuals and IMF patients.
Train_Line_2278 Table 1 describes the presenting clinical and laboratory features and subsequent events in the 277 study patients with MDS, stratified by the presence or absence of IDH mutations.
Train_Line_2279 Genomic alterations were considered as a mutation when the variation was not listed in dbSNP database (build 131 and 132), shown to be acquired or had been identified as such in other studies.
Train_Line_2280 The BaF3 stably expressing EPOR cells (BaF3-E) were previously described (Gery et al 2009) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS with 10 iu/ml recombinant erythropoietin (Epo).
Train_Line_2281 SHP-2 switches from the inactive to the active conformation after binding ligands that contain phosphotyrosyl.
Train_Line_2282 The DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is a member of the DNA methyltransferase family which includes DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L (Figure 1).
Train_Line_2283 Those patients who received HSCT were censored at the time of HSCT in survival analysis to ameliorate the influence of this treatment.
Train_Line_2284 IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were analyzed by direct sequencing and/or high-resolution melting assay.
Train_Line_2285 Table 3. Comparison of clinical and molecular characteristics of MDS patients with mutated or wild-type IDH1.
Train_Line_2286 The HEL cell line was obtained from ATCC and grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS.
Train_Line_2287 Except for a higher AML transformation rate of ZRSR2-mut patients compared with ZRSR2-wt patients in the IPSS-low or intermediate-1 subgroups (P = .022), no differences on patient outcome according to the splice gene mutation status were observed (supplemental Figures 1-2).
Train_Line_2288 Colony formations significantly increased in LSK cells with Brcc3 knockdown compared to cells infected with control lentiviral shRNA (P<0.001) (Figure 3).
Train_Line_2289 SNP-A was performed in 116 patients; 58 good (including 15 patients with isolated del 5q), 14 intermediate and 42 poor IPSS cytogenetic risk groups.
Train_Line_2290 CLASS I MUTATIONS: ACTIVATORS OF GROWTH.
Train_Line_2291 Of the 29 kinds of mutations, 3 were base substitutions, 19 with 1- to 13-bp insertions, and 7 with 1- to 11-bp deletions.
Train_Line_2292 HL60 (human promyelocytic cell line), U937 (human monocytic cell line), and K562 (human chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line) cells were cultured using Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Train_Line_2293 In myelodysplastic syndromes, about 85-90% of bone marrow cells are clonally derived.
Train_Line_2294 These enzymes are involved in adding methyl groups to the cytosine residue of CpG dinucleotides and thus play an important role in epigenetic regulation of genes.
Train_Line_2295 Tables I and II show the comparison of demographic, clinical and haematological profiles of MDS with and without TP53 mutation.
Train_Line_2296 Immunoblots were incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with appropriate secondary immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Train_Line_2297 The exact timing may vary among protocols and should meet the specific objectives of the study.
Train_Line_2298 Viability was assessed by incubating cells with 7-AAD (7-amino-actinomycin D) (BD Pharmingen) for five minutes prior to flow cytometry.
Train_Line_2299 The IPSS risk score was calculated to determine a patient's risk of leukemic transformation and survival.
Train_Line_2300 Conclusion.
Train_Line_2301 Overall survival (OS) end points, measured from the date of diagnosis, were death (failure) and alive at last follow-up (censored).
Train_Line_2302 Median overall survival of patients with TP53 mutation was shorter than wild-type (9 versus 66 months, P < 0.001) and it retained significance in multivariable model (Hazard Ratio 3.8, 95% CI 2.3-6.3,P < 0.001).
Train_Line_2303 Off target effects should always be considered when we perform knockdown experiments using a single shRNA.
Train_Line_2304 However, it is not yet clear exactly how the genetic change found here causes the blood cells to grow abnormally, or how it causes the other clinical effects of MF.
Train_Line_2305 Finally, a C-terminal UBA/LZ domain is implicated in CBL oligomerization and ubiquitin binding.
Train_Line_2306 Regimens that include cytarabine at high doses cannot be safely applied in patients aged 60 years or older because of an unacceptably high risk of toxicity.
Train_Line_2307 As previously reported, -5/5q- and/or -7/7q- were significantly more frequent among TP53-altered CK-AMLs.
Train_Line_2308 Multivariate analysis including age, IPSS risk groups, transfusion dependence, mutational status for ASXL1, RUNX1, TEL/ETV6, TP53, and CBL revealed the presence of a BCOR mutation as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-8.1; P = .008; Figure 4C).
Train_Line_2309 The patient died with no signs of leukemia from septic shock after sigmoid diverticulitis that required sigmoid resection 24 months after her initial diagnosis.
Train_Line_2310 EZH2 mutations are more frequent in PMF than the other MPNs (5-7%), but rare EZH2 mutations have been reported in both PV and ET.
Train_Line_2311 FLT3 ITD and FLT3 TKD mutations were present in 9 (8%) and 3 patients (25%), respectively.
Train_Line_2312 We therefore studied the effect of the SH2B3 PH domain mutants in HEL cells which constitutively express the JAK2 V617F mutant.
Train_Line_2313 In Table 1, we compare pretreatment features of patients with and without RAS mutations.
Train_Line_2314 MDS patients harboring a mutation in DNMT3A appear to have worse overall survival and more rapid progression to AML, suggesting that this mutation may have prognostic value in MDS.
Train_Line_2315 12. Management of special situations.
Train_Line_2316 Moreover, BCOR augments transcriptional repression by interacting with class I and II HDACs, the polycomb group protein PCGF1/NSPC1, and the histone demethylase FBXL10 through its C-terminal region, which implies that BCOR may suppress gene transcription by epigenetic mechanisms
Train_Line_2317 There was no difference in the frequency of genome-wide aberrations, TET2 expression, or the JAK2V617F 46/1 haplotype between TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients.
Train_Line_2318 Hemizygous mutations (loss of 1 allele and at least 1 mutation in the remaining allele; 47% [79 of 168]) were more frequent than homozygous mutations (26% [43 of 168]), heterozygous (18% [30 of 168]), including possible compound heterozygous mutations among the 4 patients with more than 1 heterozygous mutation), and compound heterozygous mutations (10% [16 of 168]); 65 (39%) mutations affected common hot spots, such as codons 175, 245, 248, 273, and 275.
Train_Line_2319 This last possibility is supported by a marked increased risk (~5- to 7-fold) among first-degree relatives of MPN patients.
Train_Line_2320 Tumour cells commonly have upregulated survival mechanisms which are required for the cells to cope with the stress induced by oncogenic disruptions to cell signalling.
Train_Line_2321 I no longer use anagrelide for the treatment of PV or ET because of its reported association with increased risk of arterial thrombosis, major bleeding and fibrotic progression.
Train_Line_2322 Expression of MPLW515L transforms hematopoietic cells to cytokine-independent proliferation, and results in constitutive activation of JAK-STAT signaling.
Train_Line_2323 Expression Vectors and Cell Culture.
Train_Line_2324 ET patients without a JAK2 V617F mutation displayed a pattern similar to that of normal individuals in agreement with recent data that a proportion of JAK2 V617F-negative ET patients do not have activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.
Train_Line_2325 On the 5'-end of each primer, oligonucleotide 8-mer indexes (shown in supplemental Table 2) were incorporated to allow effective separation of sample specific sequence information from the DNA pools.
Train_Line_2326 Differences in OS were tested with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models for univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively.
Train_Line_2327 Mutated IDH1/2 are neomorphic enzymes that catalyze the reduction of alphaKG to (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate.
Train_Line_2328 Further analysis of MPLWT and MPLW515L spleen and bone marrow cells demonstrated a significant erythroid population (Figure 5B, middle panel) in both sets of animals, although a shift to a more immature erythroid population was observed in MPLW515L compared with MPLWT mice as reflected by an ~2-fold increase in CD71+/Ter119- cells (Figure 5A and 5B, middle panels).
Train_Line_2329 These two PRC2 components are also mutated in myeloid malignant diseases.
Train_Line_2330 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_2331 In this study, we sequenced exons 12 to 16 of SF3B1 (NM_012433.2), exon 1 of SRSF2 (NM_003016.4), exons 2 and 6 of U2AF1 (NM_001025203), and the entire coding region of DNMT3A (NM_175629.1) in all samples by using the Sanger technique (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA).
Train_Line_2332 To assess whether TP53 mutation had independent prognostic impact, we generated a multivariate model using co-variables: age (>55 years vs. <55 years), sex, WHO subtypes, IPSS risk category, transfusion dependency and presence or absence of TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_2333 Conclusions.
Train_Line_2334 Patients.
Train_Line_2335 Among patients with typical MDS, late presentation makes it difficult to distinguish hereditary factors from aging and cumulative environmental exposures (Pfeilstocker et al, 2007; Sekeres, 2010).
Train_Line_2336 One of these patients (UPC 55) had 2 low-level mutations (14% and 17% RMA) that resided in different sequenced molecules.
Train_Line_2337 Fourteen patients had multiple mutations (Table 2).
Train_Line_2338 Postremission therapy.
Train_Line_2339 Recurrent somatic DDX41 mutations were identified in myeloid neoplasms; approximately 50% of cases in patients with germline mutations harbored somatic point mutations in the other allele.
Train_Line_2340 Furthermore, we found mutations in PTPN11 in a small percentage of individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_2341 Additionally, we cloned the mutated region of ASXL1 and identified the mutant and the wild-type clone in all nine patients with c.1934dupG;p.Gly646TrpfsX12 (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_2342 Patients with SF3B1 mutations did have a higher % of BM RS, lower median white count and a lower ALC, perhaps indicators of less aggressive disease.
Train_Line_2343 CNL has been included because of its overlapping features with aCML.
Train_Line_2344 We also observed a smaller but statistically significant (P = 0.01) increase in proliferation in cells expressing the N308D SHP-2 mutant, but proliferation was significantly lower than that observed in cells expressing the two mutants associated with JMML (P < 0.001).
Train_Line_2345 As a consequence of the development of whole genome assays (first comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays and more recently whole genome sequencing), an increasing number of mutations have been observed in BCR-ABL- negative compared with BCR-ABL-positive MPNs, and these mutations involve genes modifying epigenetic regulation.
Train_Line_2346 ICF patients are not prone to cancer, although they tend to die at an early age from infections.
Train_Line_2347 Using whole-exome sequencing of one CN-AML patient lacking mutations in NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, IDH1, and MLL-PTD, we newly identified a clonal somatic mutation in BCOR (BCL6 corepressor), a gene located on chromosome Xp11.4.
Train_Line_2348 In addition, Lnk-/- mice develop MPN with thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, and fibrosis and marked B-cell overproduction.
Train_Line_2349 Arrays were quality checked and genotyped using Affymetrix Genotyping Console with the BRLMM algorithm.
Train_Line_2350 UPN indicates unique patient number; CR, complete remission; ND, not done; NM, no mitosis; --, negative; and NA, not applicable because the mutations are point mutations that cannot be determined by GeneScan.
Train_Line_2351 Interestingly, patients with a del20q were more likely to have U2AF35 mutations than patients with no del20q (30% vs 4.5%; P = .014).
Train_Line_2352 Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation with -7.
Train_Line_2353 The JAK2 V617F mutation is present in approximately 95% of patients with polycythemia vera and in 50 to 60% of those with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_2354 Mutations in several genes associated with higher-risk MDS were more prevalent in this cohort than in previously reported populations of patients with MDS, including ASXL1 (29%), TP53 (21%), DNMT3A (18%), and RUNX1 (16%).
Train_Line_2355 The extremely low incidence of FLT3 mutations in IPSS low and intermediate-1 MDS coupled with increased incidence of FLT3 mutations in RAEB and AML as noted by Horiike et al and Bacher et al led to the suggestion that FLT3 mutation plays a role in progression from MDS to AML.
Train_Line_2356 RESULTS.
Train_Line_2357 These data are consistent with the notion of truncating mutations and/or multiple hits on the same gene, which are common mechanisms for inactivating the normal function of tumor-suppressor genes (Supplementary Fig. 9).
Train_Line_2358 All patients with MDS were enrolled in multicenter treatment trials that investigated the use of all-trans retinoic acid, antithymocyte globulin, deferasirox, lenalidomide, or thalidomide for the treatment of MDS while demethylating agents were not employed in this cohort of patients.
Train_Line_2359 Somatic mutations are common in MDS, with > 75% of patients carrying >= one abnormality in the 30 most frequently mutated genes.
Train_Line_2360 Table 1. Patient Characteristics.
Train_Line_2361 Therefore, there is currently no compelling evidence to support the need for JAK inhibitor therapy in the majority of patients with PV or ET, regardless of whether or not they are hydroxyurea-refractory.
Train_Line_2362 In the present study, we examined a cohort of 193 MDS patients for mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1 (synonym U2AF35), ZRSR2, and, as described previously, SF3B1, in the context of other molecular markers, including mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, and DNMT3A.
Train_Line_2363 These include multi-targeted inhibitors, dasatinib and PKC412, both of which can bind to the active conformation of the kinase domain favoured by D816 mutants.
Train_Line_2364 In almost all studies, and whatever the type of myeloid malignancy, ASXL1 mutations are associated with adverse features including, but not limited to myelodysplasia, myelofibrosis or progression to AML.
Train_Line_2365 Heterozygous frameshift mutations were detected in 28 patients (14.5%), whereas 12 patients (6.2%) showed heterozygous missense mutations (Table 2).
Train_Line_2366 JAK2V617F presence or increased allele burden does not appear to affect survival or leukemic transformation in PV or ET.
Train_Line_2367 A total of 452 patients, including 30 WT1-mutated and 422 WT1-wild patients, had chromosome data at diagnosis.
Train_Line_2368 Knowledge of SH2B3 status in these patients may have clinical and therapeutic implications.
Train_Line_2369 SOCS1-inactivating mutations have been described in B-cell lymphoma.
Train_Line_2370 F,female; M,male; (R),Arginine; (C),Cysteine; (H),Histidine; (S),Serine; (Q),Glutamine; # survival status; d,dead; a,alive.
Train_Line_2371 CD34+ cells from patients with RARS have a particular gene expression profile characterized by overexpression of mitochondria-related genes and, in particular, genes involved in heme synthesis (eg, ALAS2), and reduced expression of ABCB7, a gene encoding a protein involved in the transport of iron/sulfur clusters from mitochondria to the cytoplasm.
Train_Line_2372 Gene mutations and deregulated gene expression have been identified that allow us to decipher the genetic diversity within defined cytogenetic groups, in particular the large and heterogeneous group of patients with CN-AML (Figure 1).
Train_Line_2373 LNK-deficient mice show a phenotype consistent with MPN, involving an expanded hematopoietic stem cell compartment, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_2374 It should also be considered that characterization of the patient's genome before and after treatment may allow a correct assessment of response, in particular, the impact of treatment on clonal pattern of hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_2375 Bone marrow aspirates or blood were collected from the patients with various myeloid neoplasms seen at the Cleveland Clinic, University of Tokyo and Munchner Leukamielabor GmbH (MLL) (Online Supplementary Table S1).
Train_Line_2376 Patients.
Train_Line_2377 Patients.
Train_Line_2378 To analyze the incidence of DNMT3A mutations in healthy controls, peripheral-blood samples from 80 healthy blood donors (18 to 60 years of age) were obtained from the Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School.
Train_Line_2379 Analysis of germline and parental DNAs for four and two cases, respectively, indicated that the mutations were de novo germline events.
Train_Line_2380 Colonies and cell numbers were compared between the different SH2B3 constructs using unpaired student T test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Train_Line_2381 To assess the in vivo effects of the MPLW515L mutant receptor, we developed a murine model of MPLW515L-induced myeloproliferative disease.
Train_Line_2382 Similar to our findings, most ASXL1 mutations detected at leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasm patients were already present at chronic phase.
Train_Line_2383 These have been widely adopted in general practice, within clinical trials, and by regulatory agencies.
Train_Line_2384 In contrast, only one isolated 5q- with TP53 mutation had CN-LOH at 17p.
Train_Line_2385 GO is approved for relapsed AML (currently in the United States and Japan, but not in Europe) in older patients who are not considered candidates for other cytotoxic therapies.
Train_Line_2386 12.1 Hyperleukocytosis.
Train_Line_2387 The intensity of staining was variable but TP53 expression was present in proerythroblasts (in all 14 patients) and in megakaryocytes (in 10 out of 14 patients).
Train_Line_2388 Important steps have recently been made in characterizing the molecular basis of MDS.
Train_Line_2389 For multivariate analyses, a Cox proportional hazards model was employed.
Train_Line_2390 BRCC3 mutations had no impact on overall survival (Online Supplementary Figure S4).
Train_Line_2391 Two of these had additional C-terminal insertions at nucleotide 1071.
Train_Line_2392 The physiological role of spliceosomal proteins is well characterized, but the functions of RNA helicases are far less well defined and might include a possible involvement in spliceosomal function, ribosome biogenesis, and translation initiation (Putnam and Jankowsky, 2013).
Train_Line_2393 Thus, the same mutant gene, eg, TET2, may be an early driver in some patients and a subclonal driver in others.
Train_Line_2394 The functional and the prognostic roles of ASXL1 in MDS are unknown.
Train_Line_2395 This is consistent with other recent studies, however, suggesting that somatic GATA2 alterations in both ZF1 and ZF2 could be acquired only in specific AML subtypes such as AML-M5 (refs. 7,20,21).
Train_Line_2396 Moreover, while the rationale for EZH2 inhibition in lymphoma and solid tumors is becoming readily apparent, the long-term effects of EZH2 pharmacologic inhibition on normal hematopoiesis are not yet known.
Train_Line_2397 Methylation of the C/EBPalpha core promoter (-600 to ATG) was found to be an infrequent event in AML, but more recent studies find that methylation of distal promoter elements (-1600 to-600 from ATG) occurs in 30% of AML patients.
Train_Line_2398 The poor clinical outcome associated with these mutations suggests that an aggressive treatment strategy is appropriate for individuals carrying GATA2 mutations.
Train_Line_2399 The incidences of IDH mutations in our cohort were similar to those reported by Bejar et al (1.4% for IDH1 and 2.1% for IDH2 mutations) and by Kosmider et al (2% for IDH1 and 3% for IDH2 mutations), but were lower than those reported by Patnaik et al (2.9% for IDH1 and 9.4% for IDH2 mutations).
Train_Line_2400 At presentation, most patients typically have 2 or 3 driver oncogenic mutations and hundreds of background mutations.
Train_Line_2401 Similar to CEBPA and RUNX1 mutations, biallelic DDX41 mutations occur in germline DDX41 frameshift mutations carriers as secondary somatic mutations.
Train_Line_2402 Analysis of the chromatograms was performed with Mutation Surveyor Version 3.98 software (SoftGenetics).
Train_Line_2403 No significant impact on CR achievement was found for the variables WBC, platelet counts, cytogenetic MK, and s/t-AML (Table 2).
Train_Line_2404 Dyserythropoiesis was present in all patients and was characterized by large groups of immature erythroid precursors with asynchronous nuclear cytoplasmic maturation, megaloblastoid features, binucleated erythroblasts, occasional nuclear budding and karyorrhexis (Figures 1A; 2B, C, F, G).
Train_Line_2405 This concept is supported by the observation that C/EBPalpha knockout cells are unable to give rise to a myeloid disease on transduction with BCR-ABL but instead develop an acute erythroblastic leukemia, while wild-type C/EBPalpha cells give rise to a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like myeloid disease.
Train_Line_2406 Changes reported in our internal or publicly available (Database of Genomic Variants; http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home) copy number variation (CNV) databases were considered nonsomatic and were excluded.
Train_Line_2407 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_2408 Cells expressing the nonmutated CALR or the type 1 mutation of CALR showed similar sensitivity to SAR302503, suggesting that the interleukin-3-independent growth of the mutated CALR cells depends on JAK2 or a JAK family kinase targeted by SAR302503 (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2409 Median (range).
Train_Line_2410 Additional studies in larger cohorts of patients are warranted.
Train_Line_2411 Median white count (WBC), hemoglobin, platelet count, and ANC for the FLT3-mutated MDS patients at diagnosis were 3.5 3 109/l (range, 1.2-14.5), 9.9 g/l (range, 8.3-11.4), 47 3 109/l (range, 15-101), and 1.5 3 109/l (range, 0.5-7.2), respectively.
Train_Line_2412 In contrast, Nangalia et al. performed exome sequencing on samples from 151 patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms; this provided an unprecedented view of the mutational landscape in these cancers and allowed the authors to identify CALR mutations in patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis without JAK2 or MPL mutations.
Train_Line_2413 Except for one frameshift mutation starting at Q157, mutations in U2AF35 affected positions S34 and Q157 and were heterozygous missense mutations.
Train_Line_2414 7.2.1 Postremission strategies.
Train_Line_2415 Three patients with ASXL1 mutations also harbored IDH1 mutations (P = .141).
Train_Line_2416 Inhibition of the ABL kinase activity in patients results in disease regression, demonstrating that BCR-ABL is the oncogenic event responsible for the disease.

Train_Line_2418 The sideroblastic anemias include both hereditary and acquired conditions, and the most common acquired forms are RARS and RARS-T.
Train_Line_2419 It is not known whether all pre-JAK2 mutations yet to be identified will fall into this category.
Train_Line_2420 The two-sided level of significance was set at P less than 0.05.
Train_Line_2421 FLT3 mutations were identified in 12 (0.95 %) MDS patients and 13 (4.3%) CMML patients.
Train_Line_2422 Further detailed description of preclinical studies in IDH1/2-mutant in vivo models is eagerly anticipated.
Train_Line_2423 In contrast, hypermethylation of CpG islands in SOCS1 and SOCS3 associated with a decrease in expression was found in JAK2V617F PV and ET as well as in JAK2V617F and MPLW515-mutation negative ET.
Train_Line_2424 All SH2B3 mutants inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation less than WT SH2B3 suggesting that the SH2B3 PH domain mutants exhibit less functional inhibition of this stimulatory pathway.
Train_Line_2425 Treatment with busulfan or interferon-a is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures.
Train_Line_2426 The following statements and recommendations are based on studies that predominantly were performed in the United States and Europe.
Train_Line_2427 Therefore, we focused all subsequent studies on the role of SETD2 and its underlying mechanism in the development of leukemia.
Train_Line_2428 Thus, TET2 may have a similar role on HSC.
Train_Line_2429 In contrast, the frameshift and nonsense mutations occur upstream of the methyltransferase domain and are likely to be loss of function mutations.
Train_Line_2430 Background or passenger mutation: A mutation that occurs in a tissue before neoplastic transformation and has no pathophysiological significance.
Train_Line_2431 SNP array karyotyping and aberrations of 17p.
Train_Line_2432 We analyzed the coding sequence of 40 genes known to be recurrently mutated in MDS and related myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_2433 Sequential analysis of WT1 mutation during the clinical course was also performed on 133 patients to investigate the stability and pathogenic role of this mutation in AML.
Train_Line_2434 C/EBPalpha also controls stem cell self-renewal properties as C/EBPalpha-deficient HSCs show increased competitive repopulation activity in mouse transplant studies.
Train_Line_2435 For example, there was an association between SRSF2 mutations and RUNX1 mutations (P < .001) and IDH1 mutations (P = .013).
Train_Line_2436 It may, therefore, be assumed that a homozygous mutation can occur in a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell in some RARS-T patients.
Train_Line_2437 Fisher's exact test was used if any expected value of the contingency table was less than 5.
Train_Line_2438 Patients who have already undergone an allogeneic HSCT before relapse generally have immunoprophylaxis discontinued, and they may receive donor lymphocyte infusions.

(A) Flow-cytometry analysis of bone marrow cells shows a 4-fold increase in Mac1+/Gr1+ cells and a shift to a more immature erythroid population. There is a 15-fold increase in CD41+ cells in bone marrow expressing MPLW515L compared with MPLWT. (B) Flow-cytometry analysis of spleen cells shows a 10-fold increase in Mac1+/Gr1+ cells in MPLW515L. There is also a shift to a more immature erythroid population in MPLW515L with a greater percentage of CD71+/Ter119- cells. CD41+ cells are increased 30-fold in MPLW515L spleen cells compared with MPLWT spleen cells. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030270.g005
Train_Line_2440 Three new cytogenetically defined entities were incorporated: "AML with t(6;9)(p23;q34); DEK-NUP214"; "AML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21; q26.2); RPN1-EVI1"; and "AML (megakaryoblastic) with t(1; 22)(p13;q13); RBM15-MKL1," a rare leukemia most commonly occurring in infants.
Train_Line_2441 Figure 4. p.Thr354Met inhibits differentiation and apoptosis while allowing accumulation of cells in the presence of ATRA-induced differentiation. We treated HL-60 cells carrying stably transduced 4HT-regulatable GATA2 (wild-type, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) or empty vector (EV) with or without 30 nM 4HT for 24 h and then with or without 2 muM ATRA for 6 days.

In all comparisons, we used a Student's t-test.
Train_Line_2442 Quantitative gene expression levels were detected using real-time PCR with the ABI PRISM 7500 Fast Sequence Detection System and FAM dye labeled TaqMan MGB probes (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_2443 Additional genes known to be mutated in MDS include RUNX1, IDH1/2, TEL/ETV6, TP53, and NRAS.
Train_Line_2444 In our cohort, we found both germline and somatic mutations of DDX41.
Train_Line_2445 Although the different subtypes of myeloid neoplasms have distinctive characteristics, they may share morphologic abnormalities.
Train_Line_2446 Tumor volume was measured every 7 days.
Train_Line_2447 Most cases of adult myeloid neoplasms are routinely assumed to be sporadic.
Train_Line_2448 While a large number of new small molecule kinase inhibitors are under evaluation for KIT inhibition (reviewed [44]), experience with dasatinib and PKC412 suggests that they will not be effective as single agents in patients whose cancers have D816 KIT mutations.
Train_Line_2449 Overview of single arm alkylating therapy in PV and ET.
Train_Line_2450 Hypermethylation of the SOCS3 promoter was identified in 16 of 50 (32%) patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis but not in patients with essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis preceded by another myeloproliferative disorder.
Train_Line_2451 Other randomized studies in PV have compared hydroxyurea against pipobroman (the first report showed a significant difference favoring pipobroman in the incidence of transformation into post-PV MF but no difference in survival, incidence of thrombosis, or the rate of leukemic conversion; however, a longer-term follow-up revealed a shorter survival, an increased risk of leukemic transformation, and a lower risk of post-PV MF, associated with pipobroman therapy) radiophosphorus alone or with HU (no difference in survival, incidence of thrombosis, or risk of transformation into post-PV MF but radiophosphorus alone was associated with significantly less incidences of both acute leukemia and other cancers), and radiophosphorus plus phlebotomy against phlebotomy plus high-dose aspirin (900 mg/day) in combination with dipyridamole (225 mg/day) (the addition of antiplatelet agents provided no benefit in terms of thrombosis prevention but increased the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding).
Train_Line_2452 This activity is the converse of the monoubiquitination mediated by the PRC1 complex, and the balance between the 2 activities is important in the regulation of target genes, such as the HOX genes.
Train_Line_2453 Cytogenetic analysis showed a normal karyotype.
Train_Line_2454 The IPSS, a scoring system based on the karyotype, the percentage of blasts in BM, and the number of cytopenias present at the time of diagnosis, remains the most commonly used prognostic staging system for MDS since its introduction in 1997.
Train_Line_2455 The present study illustrates a potential new unfavorable prognostic marker in MDS patients, especially in patients with normal cytogenetics, which may become useful for treatment stratification in the future.
Train_Line_2456 Previous reports have highlighted the occurrence of TET2 mutations in CD34+ cells, reinforcing the view that this aberration is an early disease lesion.
Train_Line_2457 However, although these gene mutations also appear to be most prevalent in MDS, they are not associated with the presence of ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_2458 Mutations in splice genes (n = 95 patients) were mutually exclusive from the presence of a complex karyotype (1.1% vs 12.6% in patients wild-type for the 4 splice genes; P = .001) and were significantly less often detected in patients with TP53 mutations (2% vs 9% in patients wild-type for the 4 splice genes; P = .04).
Train_Line_2459 PCR fragments were sequenced directly and analyzed using Sequencing Analysis Version 5.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems) and Vector NTI Advance 10 software (Invitrogen).
Train_Line_2460 12.2 Central nervous system involvement.
Train_Line_2461 SF3B1 mutational analysis (SF3B1 exons 13-15) was performed according to previously published methods.
Train_Line_2462 However, the role of ASXL1 in leukemogenesis does not seem to be mediated by the DUB complex.
Train_Line_2463 Follow-up information was available for 154 of the 193 MDS patients and was updated through documented clinic visits as well as telephone calls to patients, their doctors, or local registry offices.
Train_Line_2464 All 4 patients with CN-LOH on 17p13 had a TP53 mutation.
Train_Line_2465 The FLT3 gene is located on chromosome 13q12.
Train_Line_2466 The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton/PBS for 10 min and blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min.
Train_Line_2467 If reproduced, DNMT3A mutation status could help risk stratify de novo MDS patients for more aggressive treatment early in their disease course, such as allogeneic transplant for eligible candidates.
Train_Line_2468 Sequencing of SRSF2 required 2 rounds of amplification using nested primers with the same cycling conditions as above for 35 cycles with each primer pair (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_2469 Second-generation sequencing technologies (eg, Illumina and SOLiD) and/or the use of array-based sequencing platforms (the Roche NimbleGen and Agilent Capture Array being 2 examples) may be the best candidates for initiating comprehensive genetic profiling of patient samples in clinical practice.
Train_Line_2470 The current concept of the disease mechanism includes abnormalities in the regulation of cellular proliferation, maturation, and survival.
Train_Line_2471 It also associates to DNA-methyltransferase (DNMT) proteins to direct DNA methylation.
Train_Line_2472 AMLs exhibiting 3 or more acquired chromosome aberrations in the absence of chromosomal rearrangements listed in the World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 category "AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities" are now defined as AML with complex karyotype (CK-AML).
Train_Line_2473 The crucial signal sequences are the splice donor site (5' end), the branch site (near the 3' end), and the splice acceptor site (3' end of the intron; Figure 1).
Train_Line_2474 Our understanding of the molecular basis of MDS has improved dramatically in the last 4 years.
Train_Line_2475 Melanoma.
Train_Line_2476 The mutation, in association with other genetic alterations, may play a role in the development, but not progression of MDS.
Train_Line_2477 All patients were on initial diagnosis with chronic phase, and the subtypes were 14 PV, 15 ET, 9 PMF, and 4 MPN, unclassified (MPN-U) (See Supporting Information I).
Train_Line_2478 Many, but not all, of the somatic variants in TET2, ASXL1, and EZH2 result in frameshifts and nonsense mutations, suggesting that they result in loss of function.

Train_Line_2480 Recently, Ley et al have identified novel mutations in the DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) gene in patients with AML.
Train_Line_2481 Differences in clinical characteristics of patients with or without DNMT3A mutations were assessed using the Fisher's exact or Mann-Whitney tests.
Train_Line_2482 Patient Sample Cohort.
Train_Line_2483 A multicenter randomized trial to address the utility of such transfusions in the setting of infections is being conducted in the United States (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00627393).
Train_Line_2484 With respect to CLL, the SF3B1 mutation is unlikely to be an initiating event.
Train_Line_2485 However, activation loop mutants are insensitive to sunitinib.
Train_Line_2486 Reproduced from Greenberg et al.
Train_Line_2487 Because BCOR and BCORL1 mutations have been described mostly in AML, we analyzed their coding sequences in a cohort of 354 MDS, 54 chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and 22 AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) patients.
Train_Line_2488 Mutation of the R882 position in DNMT3A has previously been shown to reduce the methyltransferase activity of the protein and reduces its ability to bind DNA.
Train_Line_2489 GeneScan analysis.
Train_Line_2490 The Gene Chip Mapping 250K Assay kit and the Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix) were used.
Train_Line_2491 A flowchart of the study is provided in supplemental Figure 1.
Train_Line_2492 Whereas some data suggest a positive or no prognostic impact of SF3B1 mutations, the prognostic impact and clinical characteristics of patients with mutations in other splicing genes such as SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 are unknown.
Train_Line_2493 The same were also true if the analyses were performed in the 171 MDS patients based on WHO classification (P = .001, P < .001, and P = .022, respectively; supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_2494 Numbers are according to transcript-ID ENST00000378444 (for samples analyzed in Munich) and according to NG_008880.1 (for samples analyzed in Perugia).
Train_Line_2495 Given the need to improve outcome in AML, multiple studies aimed at genetic characterization of AML have been performed in the hopes of furthering our understanding of AML pathogenesis and identifying new therapeutic approaches.
Train_Line_2496 In contrast, TP53 mutations have independent prognostic value, even in higher-risk patients with MDS, in whom they are most commonly found.

Train_Line_2500 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_2501 Abbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; CR, complete remission; C/T, chemotherapy; FAB, French-American- British classification; HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; ND, not done; RA, refractory anemia; RAEB, refractory anemia with excess blasts; RAEBT, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation.
Train_Line_2502 One recent report suggested that EZH2 mutant PMF had higher IPSS risk and worse overall survival.
Train_Line_2503 This indicated that TET2 mutations were ubiquitous across myeloid and lymphoid lineages and suggests that such events occur early in hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_2504 Based on the above, the use of aspirin in both PV and ET requires caution, especially in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 109/L), which promotes the development of AvWS.
Train_Line_2505 2.AML and MPN are independent disorders.
Train_Line_2506 The median follow-up was 45 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 27-62 months], during which time 104 (33%) patients died.
Train_Line_2507 In contrast, p.Thr355del shortens the conserved threonine string, likely affecting the orientation and p osition of Leu359, which directly contacts DNA.
Train_Line_2508 Interestingly, a recent study describes the occurrence of STAT3 mutated T-cell clones in a subset of patients with MDS, suggesting that this may represent a molecular mechanism for the occurrence of autoimmune phenomena.
Train_Line_2509 In addition to the above effects of mutant forms of IDH1/2 on hematopoiesis, 2-HG exposure results in impaired myeloid differentiation and cytokine-independent growth in TF-1 cells which normally depend on granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor for growth.
Train_Line_2510 P values were two sided and considered significant if less than .05 for outcome measures and <= .01 for the association of mutations with clinical characteristics.
Train_Line_2511 However, the possibility exists that other mutant genes of RNA splicing machinery may lead to ring sideroblast formation.
Train_Line_2512 One patient with AML following MDS had a mutation in codon 172 of IDH2 causing a conversion of AGG to AGT which leads to an Arg172Ser substitution (Table 2).
Train_Line_2513 Data on variants that could not be validated as bona fide somatic mutations owing to unavailable remission DNA and the absence of reports of the mutations in the published literature of somatic mutations were censored with respect to mutational status for that specific gene.
Train_Line_2514 DNMT3A MUTATIONS IN MDS.
Train_Line_2515 OS (median survivals of 17, 16, 17, and 20 months; P = 0.48) and LFS (leukemic transformation rates of 17, 13, 15, and 5%; P = 0.63) were similar among patients with none of the three mutations, SRSF2, SF3B1, or U2AF35 mutations, respectively.
Train_Line_2516 More than 10 clones were selected for sequencing as previously described.
Train_Line_2517 Data not available on 5 patients.
Train_Line_2518 We performed an independent validation of the MD Anderson Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System (LR-PSS) in a cohort of 288 patients with low- or intermediate-1 IPSS risk MDS and examined bone marrow samples from these patients for mutations in 22 genes, including SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, and DNMT3A.
Train_Line_2519 However, little is known about the incidence and prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_2520 TABLE II. Comparison of Concurrent Alterations of Other Genes Between MDS Patients With and Without the U2AF1 Mutation.
Train_Line_2521 TTL was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of documented leukemia transformation; patients who have no documented transformation were censored at the time of death or last visit.
Train_Line_2522 Inhibition of C/EBPalpha activity can also occur through posttranslational modifications. C/EBPalpha is phosphorylated on serine 21 shifting the ability of C/EBPalpha to induce differentiation from a granulocytic toward a monocytic phenotype.
Train_Line_2523 We report the discovery of GATA2 as a new myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)-acute myeloid leukemia (AML) predisposition gene.
Train_Line_2524 At the time of analysis, 9 of 25 patients had progressed to AML and median TTP was 9 months (range, 1-36).
Train_Line_2525 Genomic DNA was amplified by linear whole genome amplification using the REPLI-G Kit (QIAGEN) to perform a first identification screen.
Train_Line_2526 The Asian cohort of 208 patients with various myeloid malignancies was collected in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, the University of Tokyo, and collaborating centers.
Train_Line_2527 Genomic DNA was extracted from BM mononuclear cells using the DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and amplified using the REPLI-G Kit (Qiagen).
Train_Line_2528 Patients without TP53 mutations did not have a strong IHC for TP53, conferring a good negative predictive value for IHC.
Train_Line_2529 Disease Overview.
Train_Line_2530 Based on currently available data, the number of potential myelodysplasia driver genes is likely somewhat lower (50-60).
Train_Line_2531 RESULTS.
Train_Line_2532 In this study, we identified 13 somatic mutations in the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3A in 12/150 (8.0%) de novo MDS patients.
Train_Line_2533 FISH analysis indicated chromosomal translocation disrupting MLL in the patient with leukemia but not her twin sister (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Train_Line_2534 Spliceosome modulators have antitumor activity in cellular and animal models, and the available evidence indicates that interaction with splicing factor 3b is crucial for their cytotoxic activity.
Train_Line_2535 Quesada et al studied 279 untreated patients with CLL and found SF3B1 mutations in 27 (10%).
Train_Line_2536 It is also important to note that other JAK2V617F-positive MPN (or MDS/MPN) can mimic ET in their presentation; these include prefibrotic PMF and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T).
Train_Line_2537 For most abnormalities, adequate numbers have not been studied to draw firm conclusions regarding their prognostic significance.
Train_Line_2538 Viral titres were determined by serial dilutions of the viral supernatant and infection of either NIH 3T3 or 293T cells.
Train_Line_2539 Low-dose aspirin therapy has also been shown to be effective in alleviating vasomotor (microvascular) disturbances associated with ET or PV.
Train_Line_2540 METHODS.
Train_Line_2541 Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from time of transplantation to date of relapse, progression, or death and was censored at the last date known to be alive and progression free.
Train_Line_2542 Thus, like in post-CML-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, IKZF1 deletions in post-MPN-AML are late events in the progression of MPN to AML.
Train_Line_2543 ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS.
Train_Line_2544 Familial MDSs and genetic predisposition to acquisition of somatic mutations associated with myelodysplasia: germ-line GATA2 mutations.
Train_Line_2545 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_2546 We concluded that for these 2 patients, the mutations in CALR were acquired early in the major clones.
Train_Line_2547 The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is <1%/1% in ET and <3%/10% in PV.
Train_Line_2548 Serial samples of mutated patients were available in 3 cases and the SF3B1 mutation was found to be acquired during follow-up in 2 of these.
Train_Line_2549 The prognostic implication of IDH mutations in MDS remains unclear.
Train_Line_2550 METHODS.
Train_Line_2551 More recently, ASXL1 has been shown to interact with the nuclear deubiquitinase BAP1 in a biochemical complex which serves to remove a ubiquitin from histone H2A at lysine 119 (H2AK119).
Train_Line_2552 The somatic nature of SF3B1 mutations was confirmed by sequencing nontumoral CD3+ cells in 8 patients (6 patients, K700E; 1 patient, D781G; and 1 patient, R625L).
Train_Line_2553 The two JMML SHP-2 mutant immunocomplexes had a statistically significant greater activity than did the Noonan syndrome mutant immunocomplex (P < 0.005 for both).
Train_Line_2554 As such, it is similar to familial MDS-AML with monosomy 7 (refs. 3,13).
Train_Line_2555 Germ-line copy number variants in our internal database or in a publicly available database (Database of Genomic Variants) (http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home) were considered non-somatic variants and excluded.
Train_Line_2556 The incidence of SF3B1 mutation was 17% in fludarabine-refractory patients, 5% in newly diagnosed patients, and 6% in patients with Richter syndrome.
Train_Line_2557 Finally, ethnic and geographic differences might also be possible reasons.
Train_Line_2558 Therefore, the following two things are required to justify the risk of unknown long-term health effects of nonconventional drug therapy such as with IFN-a or JAK inhibitors: (i) experimental or in vivo demonstration of disease-modifying activity and (ii) controlled studies to show added value.
Train_Line_2559 Peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) samples from 234 adult patients with CK-AML were analyzed.
Train_Line_2560 Note: DNMT3A is transcribed from the "minus" strand.
Train_Line_2561 Finally, characterization of the patient's genome may guide therapeutic programs, and its inclusion in prospective clinical trials is therefore of crucial importance.
Train_Line_2562 The median OS of patients with TP53 mutations was significantly lower (9 months, n = 30) when compared to patients without mutation (66 months, n = 288, P < 0.001; Fig 3A).
Train_Line_2563 The study was approved by the ethics committee at each institution, and all the patients provided written informed consent.
Train_Line_2564 Results.
Train_Line_2565 They are associated with unfavorable clinical outcome and more rapid progression to AML in patients with RCMD or RAEB but not in those with RARS, likely because the co-occurrence of the SF3B1 mutation mitigates the negative effect of DNMT3A mutation.
Train_Line_2566 These results suggest that IDH1 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and may become useful as a poor risk marker in these patients.
Train_Line_2567 Univariate analysis demonstrated that patients with SRSF2 mutations had significantly shorter OS compared with patients without the mutation (5-year OS, 17% vs 39%; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.76; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.0-3.1; P = .049; Figure 2A and Table 2) and shorter time to AML progression (5-year AML-free survival 39% vs 69%; HR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.22-5.1; P = .012; Figure 2B and Table 3).
Train_Line_2568 HEK293 or Cos-7 cells were transfected at 90% confluence with Lipofectamine 2000.
Train_Line_2569 There were no significant differences in age, sex, WHO classification, bone marrow blasts, hemoglobin, transfusion dependence, ferritin levels, IPSS score, and number or types of treatments between the ASXL1 mutated and wild-type groups.
Train_Line_2570 It is unknown whether these therapies will be able to target the alterations induced by ASXL1, EZH2, or TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_2571 The term "myeloproliferative disorders" (MPDs) was first introduced by William Dameshek in 1951 to describe 4 different diseases with clinical and biologic similarities: polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Train_Line_2572 The MPL-W515L mutation was detected in one JAK2V617F negative patient.
Train_Line_2573 For control study, total 50 DNA samples from healthy controls were acquired.
Train_Line_2574 Identification of functional cooperative mutations of SETD2 in human acute leukemia.
Train_Line_2575 By additional analyses on concomitant mutations of other functionally important genes in the cases with BRCC3 mutations, TET2 and SF3B1 mutations were observed most frequently among mutations of 23 genes detected (Figure 2B and C).
Train_Line_2576 The prevalence of this germline minor allele in the general population is 1/12,518 (National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [NHLBI] GO Exome Sequencing Project [ESP]; https://esp.gs.washington.edu/drupal/).
Train_Line_2577 Germline DDX41 mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing in buccal swab DNA in index patients case 2 and case 3.
Train_Line_2578 He presented with 4 x 109/L white blood cells (1.8 x 109 /L neutrophils), 13.8 g/dL hemoglobin, and 43 x 109/L platelets at diagnosis.
Train_Line_2579 In addition, systemic mastocytosis involves gain-of-function mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor c-KIT.
Train_Line_2580 Patients with mutated DNMT3A had a significantly shorter OS as compared with patients with wild-type DNMT3A (median OS in mutated versus wild-type patients, 1.73 v 3.33 years; HR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.91; P = .02, Fig 1A).
Train_Line_2581 It also facilitates the recruitment of a ligation complex, which encompasses DNA LigIV and XRCC4 among other proteins.
Train_Line_2582 Indeed, in the recent study by the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, the 20 most recurrently mutated genes in AML were FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2, RUNX1, TP53, N/KRAS, CEPBPA, WT1, PTPN11, KIT, U2AF1, SMC1A, SMC3, PHF6, STAG2, and RAD21.
Train_Line_2583 These findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylase activity might be effective in the treatment of IDH1-mutant and TET2-mutant myeloid leukemias.
Train_Line_2584 In conclusion, ASXL1 mutations in association with other genetic alterations may have a role in the development of MDS but contribute little to disease progression.
Train_Line_2585 Table 1. Characteristics of patients with BRCC3 mutations.
Train_Line_2586 In the recent study by Papaemmanuil et al, the median leukemia-free survival was >3 years in patients with 1 or 2 driver mutations vs <2 years in patients with >=3 driver mutations.
Train_Line_2587 Association of WT1 mutation with other molecular abnormalities.
Train_Line_2588 With the exception of 1 patient, the mutation occurred exclusively in patients older than 50 years (Table 1).
Train_Line_2589 IKZF1 deletions are frequent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, especially in BCR-ABL- positive cases.
Train_Line_2590 Activating mutation of KIT was first reported in the human mast cell leukaemia line, HMC-1.
Train_Line_2591 Recently, work from our group examining the associations of genetic mutations and response to high-dose (90 mg/m2) vs standard dose (45 mg/m2) daunorubicin-induction chemotherapy in AML patients from 16 to 60 years of age suggested that DNMT3A patients specifically benefit from high-dose daunorubicin induction therapy.
Train_Line_2592 Socs1-/- mice have low B-cell numbers due to defective interferon-y signaling.
Train_Line_2593 Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study patients are detailed in Table I.
Train_Line_2594 This MK category was reported to be associated with a dismal prognosis and to add prognostic information, even in CK-AML.
Train_Line_2595 Mutations in one of the genes belonging to the splicing machinery (SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1) were found in 67 of 193 MDS patients (34.7%).
Train_Line_2596 Diagnosis, relevant details, and sample preparation are detailed in supplemental Methods (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Train_Line_2597 Larger-scale studies of LNK mutation in human MPN are warranted.
Train_Line_2598 The most common recurrent SF3B1 mutation affected amino acid residue K700 (21 of 37, 56.7%).
Train_Line_2599 However, mutRAS patients receiving high-dose cytarabine consolidation (HDAC; 3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 or 400 mg/m2/d x 5 days) had the lowest 10-year CIR, 45%, compared with 68% for wtRAS patients receiving HDAC and 80% and 100%, respectively, for wtRAS and mutRAS patients receiving low-dose cytarabine (LDAC; 100 mg/m2/d x 5 days; overall comparison, P < .001).
Train_Line_2600 It has been suggested that molecular risk factors can influence outcome of patients undergoing allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.
Train_Line_2601 PATIENTS.
Train_Line_2602 Detection of mutations in other genes, including IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, MLL/PTD, RUNX1, FLT3/ITD, WT1, N-RAS, K-RAS, ASXL1, DNMT3, and EZH2, was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_2603 Response to therapy.
Train_Line_2604 All the mutations identified were missense substitutions.
Train_Line_2605 The only recurrently affected gene was CALR, encoding calreticulin.
Train_Line_2606 These mutations were mutually exclusive and 54% of the patients displayed at least one mutation.
Train_Line_2607 Therefore, a crucial (and presently unknown) factor in MPN pathogenesis is the latency between the mutation of JAK2 and the appearance of the disease.
Train_Line_2608 In most prostate adenocarcinomas it is expressed at low levels.
Train_Line_2609 Using this approach, chromosomal aberrations were found to be restricted to committed myeloid progenitor cells in MDS patients, suggesting that the genetic lesion occurred in a hematopoietic cell with the capacity to differentiate into mature myeloid cells.
Train_Line_2610 The existing structure of the partial helicase domain of human DDX41 (PDB ID: 2P6N) and the structure of Drosophila Vasa (PDB ID: 2DB3) were used to generate a structural model (Figure S5C).
Train_Line_2611 Intriguingly, in vitro data have suggested that mutant RAS protooncogenes may sensitize leukemia and carcinoma cells to cytarabine.
Train_Line_2612 At a first glance, this appears to sharply contrast with CML, where BCR-ABL is thought to fully explain the disease, although this is not the case for all CML patients.
Train_Line_2613 We can, therefore, exclude a selection bias for the patients from whom DNA was available.
Train_Line_2614 Conversely, mice overexpressing transgenic SOCS3 lack fetal liver erythrocytosis.
Train_Line_2615 The identification of 5 of 10 recurrent molecular genetic alterations in AML patients with prognostic importance presents a challenge for implementing testing of these genetic alterations into clinical practice.
Train_Line_2616 Jones et al. detected methylation of the retinoic acid receptor-beta gene (RARB) in 89% (16/18) of IMF patients and also showed reduced expression in CD34+ cells.
Train_Line_2617 To analyze the oncogenic capability of the mutant calreticulin, we generated Ba/F3 cells with overexpression of the nonmutant and the type 1 mutant CALR (52-bp deletion).
Train_Line_2618 No difference in patient outcome was observed when analyzing the genotypes SF3B1-mut/DNMT3A-mut or SF3B1-mut/DNMT3A-wt (data not shown).
Train_Line_2619 Therefore, cooperation of JAK2V617F with other genetic events modifying HSC biology will greatly facilitate the development of a clinical phenotype.
Train_Line_2620 All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS, Version 15 software (SPSS Inc) and Statsdirect.
Train_Line_2621 Methylation analysis of the SOCS3 CpG island.
Train_Line_2622 Three mutated patients died after 56 days, 1.4 years, and 3.5 years, whereas 3 patients were alive at last follow up 117 days, 2.1 years, and 5.8 years after diagnosis.
Train_Line_2623 Moreover, little is known about the mechanisms leading to the disease-defining features of MDS.
Train_Line_2624 The genetic basis of myelodysplasia and its clinical relevance.
Train_Line_2625 Only those patients for whom the RAS mutation status was determined, who had a successful cytogenetic and/or molecular genetic analysis of a pretreatment sample that allowed determination of whether patients had or did not have core binding factor (CBF) AML (ie, whether they were positive or negative for t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and inv(16)/t(16;16)/CBFB-MYH11), achieved a complete remission, and were randomly assigned to one of three consolidation treatment arms on CALGB 8525 were eligible for inclusion in this study.
Train_Line_2626 They are more frequently observed in PMF than PV and ET and are also present in other types of malignant myeloid diseases.
Train_Line_2627 JAK2V617F presence or increased allele burden does not appear to affect survival or leukemic transformation in PV or ET.
Train_Line_2628 Dysregulation of the C/EBPalpha Differentiation Pathway in Human Cancer.
Train_Line_2629 MSCV retroviral supernatants were titered by determining the percentage of GFP positive cells 48 hours after infection of Ba/F3 and 32D cells (1 mL supernatant used to infect 1 x 106 cells).
Train_Line_2630 In contrast, SF3B1-wt/DNMT3A-mut patients had an inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.35; 95% CI, 1.09-5.46; P = .033) and a higher risk of AML transformation (HR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.05-7.68; P = .04; Figure 4A-B) compared with all other genotypes (SF3B1-mut/DNMT3A-mut or SF3B1-mut/DNMT3A-wt or SF3B1-wt/DNMT3A-wt).
Train_Line_2631 Longer overall survival was observed among patients with primary myelofibrosis or essential thrombocythemia carrying a CALR mutation than among those with a JAK2 mutation; in particular, it was much more relevant in primary myelofibrosis, which confirms previous findings in patients with and those without a JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_2632 Following up on this finding, we investigated the alignments for the remaining four patients and detected a recurrent 5-bp insertion in all four (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2633 Figure 4. Molecular Determinants of Response to High-Dose Daunorubicin Induction Chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of overall survival are shown in the entire cohort according to DNMT3A mutational status (Panel A) and according to DNMT3A status and receipt of high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin (Panel B). The P value in Panel B is for the comparison across all groups. The rates of overall survival according to receipt of high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin are shown among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (Panel C) and among patients without DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and with no MLL translocations (Panel D).
Train_Line_2634 Patients and Methods.
Train_Line_2635 He also gained concurrently novel mutations of NPM1 and NRAS at that time (Table 5; Figure 1).
Train_Line_2636 The impact of U2AF1 mutation on clinical outcomes of MDS patients was inconclusive in prior reports.
Train_Line_2637 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by excessive production of mature blood cells.
Train_Line_2638 Most cases with 11q23 abnormalities express the NG2 homologue (encoded by CSPG4) reacting with the monoclonal antibody 7.1.
Train_Line_2639 Patients.
Train_Line_2640 Eight patients had P95_R102del(c.284_307del), a 24-base pair deletion resulting in an 8-amino acid deletion starting from proline 95.
Train_Line_2641 Among patients with essential thrombocythemia, who had much longer overall survival than those with primary myelofibrosis, there was a significant difference only between patients with a CALR mutation and those with a JAK2 mutation (P = 0.04) (Fig. 4B).
Train_Line_2642 DDX41 defects lead to a hereditary leukemia syndrome, and somatic lesions of this gene also occur in sporadic myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_2643 Frank G. Rucker;1 Richard F. Schlenk; Lars Bullinger; Sabine Kayser; Veronica Teleanu; Helena Kett; Marianne Habdank; Carla-Maria Kugler; Karlheinz Holzmann; Verena I.

Train_Line_2644 Purified PCR fragments were sequenced directly using forward or reverse primers.
Train_Line_2645 Using murine lin-sca 1+c-kit+ (LSK) cell model (Oakley et al, 2012), we also confirmed higher levels of c-kit and lower expression of Gr-1 upon DDX41 knockdown, illustrating defective differentiation in DDX41-deficient cells (Figure S5H).
Train_Line_2646 GATA2-responsive promoter and enhancer studies.
Train_Line_2647 We also analyzed a total of 353 AML patients from Italy, including 192 patients (157 CN-AML patients and 35 patients with recurrent translocations) from the Northern Italy Leukemia Group and 161 patients (105 CN-AML patients and 56 patients with cytogenetic abnormalities, including 21 with recurrent translocations) from various Italian hematologic centers.
Train_Line_2648 In summary, we identified IDH1 mutations of amino acid 132 in 3.6% of MDS patients, and found a strong correlation of mutated IDH1 with unfavorable outcome in these patients.
Train_Line_2649 Several proteins interact with snRNAs to form snRNPs within the spliceosome.
Train_Line_2650 For this process, canonical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) is initiated by binding of the Ku70/80 heterodimer to DSB free ends; DNA-bound Ku protects the DSB free ends from nuclease digestion while it recruits DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to the DSB.
Train_Line_2651 However, the mutations we detected were on the SH2 domain or C-terminus.
Train_Line_2652 Despite several investigations, the mechanisms by which neoplastic hematopoietic cells leave the primary site and migrate to other bone marrow districts remain largely unclear.
Train_Line_2653 Mutation quantification by deep sequencing Short fragments of 100 to 200 bp were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified from genomic DNA in 10 BCOR-mutated patients by PCR (primers are listed in supplemental Table 6).
Train_Line_2654 A very detailed analysis of what has been learned about cancer genomes in the last few years has been published recently by Vogelstein et al.
Train_Line_2655 More recently, two studies randomized ET patients to hydroxyurea or anagrelide.
Train_Line_2656 However, there appear to be more pathways comprising chromosomal rearrangements and mutations in multiple genes (eg, TP53, RUNX1, RAS).
Train_Line_2657 Clinically, evaluation of somatic defects in MDS may improve diagnosis, accuracy of prognoses, and treatments, i.e. may have implications.
Train_Line_2658 However, no significant difference in the frequency of these concurrent genetic mutations could be detected between the patients with and without U2AF1 mutation.
Train_Line_2659 While benefits have been obtained from use of inhibitors of KIT kinase activity such as imatinib, especially in gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST), primary resistance occurs with certain oncogenic mutations.
Train_Line_2660 For the patients with discrepancy of the mutation status of the IDH in paired samples, TA cloning was performed in the samples without detectable mutant by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_2661 Whole exome sequencing: A procedure that allows to sequence all the coding regions (exomes) of a genome.
Train_Line_2662 In AML, they are found in secondary (30%) rather than in de novo cases (6.5%), and in AML with normal karyotype ASXL1 mutations are mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations.
Train_Line_2663 Indeed, this scoring system was more powerful than single marker to separate patients into different prognostic groups; and unlike the sophisticated gene-expression profiling, it could be easily implemented in routine clinical laboratories.
Train_Line_2664 MDS is a heterogeneous condition, and patients have highly variable clinical courses.
Train_Line_2665 Another schedule is mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2 per day) and etoposide (100 mg/m2 per day) given for 5 days.
Train_Line_2666 L576 stabilises a very short helix in the JMD, which would be disrupted upon mutation to a proline.
Train_Line_2667 METHODS.
Train_Line_2668 These observations likely explain the almost complete ablation of DNA binding.
Train_Line_2669 Figure 1. Distribution of ASXL1 mutations along the protein. From top to bottom are shown the localization of the ASXL1 gene on chromosome region 20q11, the exon structure of ASXL1, and the ASXL1 protein with its conserved motifs and binding regions: HARE helix-turn-helix at the N-terminus, HP1/CBX5 binding region, ASXH, an a-helical domain that contains LXXLL (nuclear receptor boxes), and the C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. Below reported mutations (see Table 1) are shown along the protein: circles and triangles indicate frameshift and nonsense mutations, respectively, and the colors correspond to the exon location.
Train_Line_2670 Granulocyte SOCS3 expression was very similar in IE patients and in normal individuals (Figure 3B).
Train_Line_2671 The SF3B1 mutant allele burden could be accurately assessed (as defined under "Mutation analysis of SF3B1 and SF3B1 mutant allele burden") in 161 of 168 mutated cases.
Train_Line_2672 Correlation of IDH mutations with clinical features.
Train_Line_2673 The utility of DNMT3A mutations for treatment stratification need to be assessed in future studies.
Train_Line_2674 A recent study by Nikpour et al has tested the hypothesis that a reduced expression of ABCB7 plays a role in the pathophysiology of RARS.
Train_Line_2675 BCOR mutations associate with DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_2676 Blood smears from both showed the presence of immature monocytes (Figure S1B).
Train_Line_2677 A P value of less than .05 was set as the threshold of clinical significance.
Train_Line_2678 Thus, whereas somatic JAK2 mutations are found in nearly all patients with polycythemia vera, approximately one third of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis do not carry any mutation in JAK2 or MPL.
Train_Line_2679 A mutant allele burden or VAF of about 50% in regions of diploid DNA content in a homogeneous cell population (e.g., circulating granulocytes in myeloid neoplasms) suggest a fully clonal population of cells that are heterozygous for the mutation.
Train_Line_2680 Prognostic Value of Molecular Alterations in Intermediate-Risk AML.
Train_Line_2681 Granulocyte SOCS1 transcript levels appeared to be slightly higher among IE patients than among normal individuals (Figure 3A) although this difference was not statistically significant.
Train_Line_2682 Mutations in these genes are also found in a great variety of myeloid malignancies, including MDS and AML, suggesting a common pathogenesis in the 3 disorders but implying that these mutated genes are not directly involved in the phenotype of the myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_2683 Patients.
Train_Line_2684 This was not significantly different to levels reported in the general population.
Train_Line_2685 1. Familial MPN has been described with a dominant-autosomal transmission.
Train_Line_2686 Finally, interest in this mutation is not only derived from its value as a prognostic biomarker but also because it can serve as a therapeutic target.
Train_Line_2687 Genomic DNA was obtained from bone marrow mononuclear cells, CD34+ cells, or peripheral blood granulocytes by following standard protocols for human tissue.
Train_Line_2688 Finally, a study of 18 genes in a large cohort of MDSs showed that mutations in 5 genes had prognostic impact: TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1 and ASXL1.
Train_Line_2689 Somatic point mutations in the PH domain of SH2B3 (LNK), an adaptor protein that is highly expressed in haematopoietic cells, were recently described in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_2690 Our data provide the first evidence of a mutant protein tyrosine phosphatase acting as an oncoprotein in myeloid leukemias.
Train_Line_2691 Although we found no mutations in EPOR or GCSFR, we identified a guanine to thymidine substitution in MPL at nucleotide 1544 which results in a tryptophan to leucine substitution at codon 515 (MPLW515L) in two patients with MF (Figure 1A and 1B).
Train_Line_2692 By SNP-array karyotyping, deletions in BRCA1-A and BRISC component genes were found in 21 of 677 (3.1%) patients.
Train_Line_2693 The SHP-2 protein is strongly expressed in blood cells and is implicated in the response to KIT-ligand, interleukin-3, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor and erythropoietin.
Train_Line_2694 Furthermore, the increased sensitivity of NGS allows the identification of low-abundance mutant clones, enabling the study of disease evolution.
Train_Line_2695 Scientists who study this disorder believe that the disease starts from just one abnormal cell, which divides to replace all the other cells-- that is, all the abnormal cells are part of one clone.
Train_Line_2696 TABLE V. Univariate Analysis of Clinical Parameters and Molecular Alterations on Overall Survival.
Train_Line_2697 In a series of 34 post-MPN-AML patients, RUNX1 mutations were found in leukemic blasts of 11, most of which were localized in the RUNT domain (residues 50-177).
Train_Line_2698 Because of evolving technology that occurred in the course of the study, we switched from array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array-based genomic profiling.
Train_Line_2699 Adjusted for blast percentage, conditioning regimen, complex karyotype, and donor type.
Train_Line_2700 The p.A536T (c.1606G>A) variation was detected in a PV patient.
Train_Line_2701 These have typical KIT mutations seen in GIST, but have benign characteristics.
Train_Line_2702 A second problem is the heterogeneity present in any sizable defined group, but hidden by the terms "older patient," "medically unfit patient," or "patient ineligible for standard intensive chemotherapy."
Train_Line_2703 Cytogenetics at initial diagnosis: inv(16) or t(16;16) (0 points); t(8;21) (3 points); other (5 points).
Train_Line_2704 Controlled studies have confirmed the anti-thrombotic value of low-dose aspirin in PV, among all risk categories.

Train_Line_2707 Relevant abstracts presented at the 2006, 2007, and 2008 meetings of the American Society of Hematology, the European Hematology Association, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology were also reviewed.
Train_Line_2708 Figure 1. Mutational and functional analysis of the MLL-NRIP3 fusion gene identified a monozygotic twin pair discordant for MLL-rearranged leukemia. (a) Circos plot showing the genetic alterations identified in the twin with leukemia, using the healthy twin as a normal control. Genes with validated coding single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and fusion genes are indicated. CNV, copy-number variation. (b) Genetic events in the formation of the MLL-NRIP3 fusion gene. Sequencing reads, shown as groups of short arrows, were aligned onto the non-rearranged MLL-NRIP3 locus on chromosome 11 (top row, labeled alignment). Paired reads mapped onto six non-continued regions were identified and assembled into three contigs (second row, labeled local assembly). Non-continued regions connected by paired reads are joined by a bracket (below the MLL-NRIP3 locus) and a curved line (above the MLL-NRIP3 locus), with the numbers of supportive paired reads shown. The three assembled contigs were realigned onto the non-rearranged loci to identify potential chromosomal break points, which are indicated by five vertical lines (third row, labeled realigning). The rearranged MLL-NRIP3 locus was assembled. PCR primers (P1/P2, P3/P4 and P5/P6) were designed to confirm the fusion conjunctions resulting from the chromosomal rearrangements (fourth row, labeled PCR validation, and Supplementary Fig. 4). (c) Survival curve for recipients of the bone marrow cells transduced with MLL-NRIP3 or the empty vector control (P = 5.91 x 10-5, Mantel-Haenszel test). MLL-NRIP3 induced myeloid leukemia with a median survival of 46.5 days. (d) Immature myeloblasts are shown by the morphology of the bone marrow biopsy specimen from a mouse with MLL-NRIP3 leukemia. Throughout the figures, * indicates significance passing the threshold of P < 0.05, ** indicates passing the threshold of P < 0.01, and *** indicates passing the threshold of P < 0.001.
Train_Line_2709 Statistical Analysis.
Train_Line_2710 Furthermore, disease complications in ET are effectively and safely managed by treatment with low-dose aspirin and, in case of high-risk disease, hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_2711 Only one mutation was found in 79 patients with core-binding factor leukemias precluding any formal analysis.
Train_Line_2712 Gene set enrichment analysis was performed by using gene ontology gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (http://www.broad.mit.edu/gsea/msigdb/).
Train_Line_2713 MPLW515L Confers a Proliferative Advantage to Bone Marrow and Spleen Cells.
Train_Line_2714 Patients Cell samples from 193 MDS patients were collected at the time of enrollment in clinical trials.
Train_Line_2715 METHODS.
Train_Line_2716 The small molecule inhibitor, imatinib, has had great benefit in treatment of GIST, but so far kinase inhibitors have made little impact in SM or other malignancies.
Train_Line_2717 In contrast to isolated 5q, CK with single TP53 mutations (n = 13) LOH indicated by a mutant allele burden >50% (suggestive of homozygous or hemizygous mutation) was seen in 10 cases (confirmed in all 5 SNP-A analysed cases) and 3 cases had low clones (range 14-24% and 2 of 3 had deletion 17p).
Train_Line_2718 In addition, deletions of DDX4 (5q11.2) and DHX58 (17q21.2) loci were identified in 14 and 13 cases, respectively (data not shown).
Train_Line_2719 These findings demonstrate the importance of the clonal context in which SH2B3 mutations occur and underscore the complexity of genomic alterations in haematopoietic malignancies.
Train_Line_2720 Statistical calculations were performed using SPSS version 17.
Train_Line_2721 However, none of the genetic events at the origin of this familial form is presently known, and this could correspond either to a "mutator" phenotype related to an alteration in gene repair or to a haploinsufficiency in a tumor suppressor gene.
Train_Line_2722 The alteration of some of these genes may carry prognostic value.
Train_Line_2723 Peripheral blood was collected from the retro-orbital cavity using EDTA-treated glass capillary tubes and analyzed by automated complete and differential blood cell counts and blood smears (Wright-Giemsa stained).
Train_Line_2724 TET1 protein has been implicated in leukemia as a fusion partner of the MLL gene product in the t(10;11)(p12;q23) chromosomal translocation and has been shown to be capable of hydroxymethylation and thereby possibly contributing to cytosine methylation patterns and epigenetic gene regulation.
Train_Line_2725 In MDS, TP53 mutations have long been known to be associated with karyotype, elevated bone marrow blast percentage, and severe thrombocytopenia.
Train_Line_2726 With such regimens, CR is achieved in 60% to 80% of younger adults.
Train_Line_2727 Our preliminary evidence suggests that parameters such as hemoglobin level, blast count, and high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities will continue to retain strong independent prognostic value (M.C., L.M., and M.G.D.P., unpublished data, August 8, 2013).
Train_Line_2728 This reliably allowed detection of mutations down to 10% relative mutation abundance (RMA), defined as the proportion of sequence reads containing the mutation.
Train_Line_2729 Figure 2. NGS clonal sequencing allows direct detection of independent disease clones. (A) Two C to T substitutions in TET2 exon 11 are depicted by the dominant red bars and are found in approximately 17% of sequence reads (17% variation [left axis] from the reference sequence [x-axis]). The sequence coverage (number of reads) across the region is shown on the right axis and is traced by the blue line. Experimental noise is shown underneath the dotted line with reads for bases A (green bars), C (blue bars), G (black bars), T (red bars), and base deletions (gray bars) at less than 4% of reads. (B) A selection of individual sequence reads lined up against each other is shown and demonstrates that the 2 mutations are found in separate molecules being sequenced and thus belong to independent clones or alternate alleles.
Train_Line_2730 Although reliable conclusions will be made possible only by prospective studies, this scheme provides a proof of concept of the potential feasibility of a molecular classification of MDS and related myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_2731 Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of 5 small nuclear RNAs associated with proteins to form particles termed small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP).

Each bar/value represents the mean += SEM of three independent experiments performed in duplicate unless stated otherwise. *p < 0.05. See also Figure S5.
Train_Line_2733 The 28 BRCC3 mutations occurred in nonsense (n=12; 42.9%), missense (n=6; 21.4%), splice site (n=5; 17.9%), frameshift (n=4; 14.3%), and non-frameshift deletion (n=1; 3.6%) forms.
Train_Line_2734 Patients.
Train_Line_2735 TP53 expression was absent in 5 patients with mutations, although one patient had a low-level clone (14%), one had a splice site mutation and the other 3 patients had ins/del leading to frame shift mutations.
Train_Line_2736 Abnormalities in specific genes, such as NRAS, RUNX1, and TP53, have been associated with prognostically important variables, including elevated bone marrow blast proportion and severe thrombocytopenia.
Train_Line_2737 There was no significant difference observed in detected aberrations between cytogenetic risk groups (good, intermediate, and poor) and IPSS scores (low and high risk).
Train_Line_2738 Mutational analysis also revealed that patients with a mutation in DNMT3A or NPM1 or a MLL translocation had improved overall survival with high-dose chemotherapy, as compared with standard-dose chemotherapy (3-year rate of overall survival, 44% vs. 25%) (Fig. 5B), showing that mutational analysis can identify specific genetically defined subgroups of patients who benefit from high-dose induction chemotherapy.
Train_Line_2739 Background mutation levels in skin confirmed the acquired nature of these aberrations.
Train_Line_2740 Fig 1. Prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in all investigated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). (A) Overall survival in patients with AML having wild-type (WT) or mutated DNMT3A. (B) Relapse-free survival in patients with AML having WT or mutated DNMT3A.
Train_Line_2741 In the second study, which was designed as a noninferiority trial, 258 previously untreated high-risk patients were randomized to either anagrelide (n = 122) or hydroxyurea (n = 136).
Train_Line_2742 In univariate analyses, ASXL1, CBL, RUNX1, TEL/ETV6, and TP53 were associated with a poor prognosis for OS.
Train_Line_2743 Pruritus occurs in the majority of patients with PV (and a substantial number with PMF) and is often exacerbated by hot bath.
Train_Line_2744 None of these patients carried BCOR disruptive mutations.
Train_Line_2745 Expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 leads to reduced JAK and STAT phosphorylation, reduced STAT dimerization and import to the nucleus and reduced transcription of target genes.
Train_Line_2746 Ninety-six patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Train_Line_2747 Furthermore, such mutations may also modulate the degree of JAK2 kinase activity leading to the variable phenotype observed among patients with JAK2 V617F-positive disease.
Train_Line_2748 We compared global DNA methylation in patients with wild-type and mutated status but did not find a difference in DNA methylation levels.
Train_Line_2749 Thus, at last follow-up 6/11 RARS-T patients had an allelic ratio >50%T and evidence of the presence of cells homozygous for JAK2V617F (Figure 4).
Train_Line_2750 Median values for SF3B1 mutant allele burden were 40.6% (24.6%-52.1%) in the CD34+ cell DNA subgroup, 40.9% (7.5%-70.3%) in the granulocyte DNA subgroup, and 35.7% (10.1%-51.1%) in the bone marrow DNA subgroup.
Train_Line_2751 By combining patients with either EZH2 mutations or LR-PSS category 3 risk, 29% of patients with lower-IPSS-risk MDS could be identified with shorter-than-expected overall survival - a group that could be considered for more aggressive initial therapy.

Train_Line_2753 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_2754 E.g. ATRA upregulates C/EBPalpha mRNA and protein in myeloid cells.
Train_Line_2755 In CMML, the early clonal dominance of TET2 mutations has been shown to lead to granulo-monocytic differentiation skewing at the expense of erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation.
Train_Line_2756 Low-dose aspirin therapy has also been shown to be effective in alleviating vasomotor (microvascular) disturbances associated with ET or PV.
Train_Line_2757 MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene; 1p34) mutations occur in approximately 4% of ET patients, 8% of PMF patients, and rarely in PV.
Train_Line_2758 Mutations were described using 2 different databases (IARC TP53 Database; www.p53.iarc.fr and The TP53 Web site; www.p53.free.fr).
Train_Line_2759 The distribution of BCOR transcript levels in MDS patients with BCOR-wt was equivalent to that of non-MDS control samples.
Train_Line_2760 While SF3B1 mutations were initially shown to be associated with a favorable prognosis, 4 different MDS cohorts failed to reproduce these data.
Train_Line_2761 In other words, exposure to alkylating agents other than hydroxyurea probably selects patients who are at a higher risk of leukemic transformation because of older age, longer disease duration and intrinsic aggressive disease biology.
Train_Line_2762 We identified six additional patients with the germline c.419insGATG variant (cases 12 and 14-18; Figure S2C) and two patients with two different germline mutations of DDX41 (case 13, c.156_157insA and p.Q52fs, and case 19, c.G465A and p.M155I).
Train_Line_2763 A third report identified a Japanese family with an N-terminal germline mutation and an additional C-terminal mutation in two individuals developing AML.
Train_Line_2764 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_2765 In recent genome sequencing studies rare mutations in ASXL1 and ASXL3 have also been found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia but not in T-cell acute leukemia.
Train_Line_2766 SOCS3 transcription is upregulated by cytokineinduced signal transduction and transcript levels are raised in PV, as shown in this study and by Kralovics et al.
Train_Line_2767 The mutual exclusivity of pairs of mutations was evaluated with the use of two-by-two contingency tables and Fisher's exact test.
Train_Line_2768 Only alterations affecting the most conserved 2 nucleotides at exon/intron junctions have been considered as splice-site mutations.
Train_Line_2769 P value from univariate or multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.
Train_Line_2770 This new information does not necessarily change how we currently risk stratify patients with PV or ET; age 60 years and history of thrombosis are the two risk factors used to classify patients with PV or ET into low (0 risk factors) and high (1 or 2 risk factors) risk groups (Table IV).
Train_Line_2771 Precursor mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecule composed of small nuclear RNAs associated with proteins.
Train_Line_2772 Twelve colonies from each reaction were PCR-amplified using pJET1 sequencing primers (Fermentas) and sequenced.
Train_Line_2773 The available evidence suggests that this may apply also to MDS: at variance with AML, however, the genetic lesions responsible for MDS likely occur sequentially over years, rather than over months or weeks, at least in low-risk subtypes with long natural history of disease, as is typically RARS.
Train_Line_2774 The data with regard to the other mutations needs further elucidation.
Train_Line_2775 Bone marrow at that time is usually hypoplastic or aplastic, documenting the antileukemia effect.
Train_Line_2776 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_2777 TABLE III. International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) Recommended Criteria for Postpolycythemia Vera and Postessential Thrombocythemia Myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_2778 In addition to noting frequent co-occurrence of KIT mutations with core-binding-factor alterations t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16), we found significant co-occurrence of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with NPM1 mutations and of DNMT3A mutations with NPM1, FLT3, and IDH1 alleles (P<0.001 for all comparisons) (Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2779 Basic concepts of RNA splicing.
Train_Line_2780 In contrast, an exon 11 mutation resulting in the substitution V560G enhanced sensitivity to imatinib by more than 10-fold.
Train_Line_2781 Various types of postremission strategies have been evaluated including intensive conventional chemotherapy, prolonged maintenance treatment, and high-dose therapy followed by autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
Train_Line_2782 Adverse drug reactions or poor response led to discontinuation of the study drug in 19 patients treated with anagrelide and 10 patients treated with hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_2783 "AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22); RUNX1-RUNX1T1" and "AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11" are considered as AML regardless of bone marrow blast counts.
Train_Line_2784 Because of its low toxicity, imatinib warrants further investigation in patients with KIT exon 8 or N822K mutations which are relatively common in CBF AML and sensitive to the drug.
Train_Line_2785 Intriguingly, a recent study surveying the spliceosome gene mutations in pediatric patients with MDS also showed that these mutations were extremely uncommon in the pediatric cohort, a finding compatible with our result.
Train_Line_2786 These figures were well within the baseline risk that is intrinsic to the diseases and no different than those seen with hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_2787 Revised IPSS: very low, <=1.5; low, >1.5 to 3; intermediate, >3 to 4.5; high, >4.5 to 6, very high, >6.
Train_Line_2788 Some studies reported that patients with RAS mutations had improved overall survival, whereas others found that these patients had worse complete remission rates, overall survival, and disease-free survival than those with wild-type RAS.
Train_Line_2789 Our first insight into the molecular cause of these disorders came when the somatic JAK2 V617F mutation was identified in the majority of patients with polycythemia vera and in a subset of patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_2790 Interestingly, the sequencing data were also predictive of a further 8 LOH regions at the TET2 locus where SNP array analysis was not informative, having mutations that were found at greater than 65% RMA and consistent SNP frequencies (Table 1; example shown in Figure 5).
Train_Line_2791 Our findings suggest that RCMD and RCMD-RS should be instead considered as separate conditions, or at least that a distinction should be made between patients with wild-type SF3B1 and those with a somatic mutation of this gene.
Train_Line_2792 The median survival of patients with U2AF35 mutations was 20 months, and to date, 13 (65%) deaths and 1 (5%) leukemic transformation have been recorded.
Train_Line_2793 The valine-to-phenylalanine (V617F) alteration constitutively activates JAK2, resulting in increased phosphorylation of its substrates and leading to increased cytokine responsiveness of myeloid cells.
Train_Line_2794 By all the established and recognized criteria (Lawrence et al, 2014), somatic DDX41 mutations we found are driver mutations (Makishima et al, 2014).
Train_Line_2795 This was not related to the number of myeloid precursor cells present within the mononuclear cell population.
Train_Line_2796 This may have been the result of disease-modifying effects of conditioning and transplantation or because of the fact that the prognostic significance of these gene mutations is more pronounced in lower-risk patients, of whom there were few in this study.
Train_Line_2797 Figure 2. Relative frequencies and pairwise cooccurrences of TP53 alteration-associated genomic aberrations illustrated using Circos Table Viewer Version 0.52. The percentages indicate the proportion of each aberration associated with (A) TP53-altered CK-AMLs and (B) TP53-unaltered CK-AMLs. Unaltered TP53 and amp(11)(q13~q25) were mutually exclusive. MK is based on cytogenetics analysis.

Train_Line_2799 In 45 patients (82%), TET2 mutations ranged between 15% and 61% RMA (median, 41%).
Train_Line_2800 In all experiments, the molar equivalents of empty vector constructs were used to balance gene-expressing constructs to avoid squelching artifacts.
Train_Line_2801 The difference in the consolidation dose of cytarabine had greater impact on patients with RAS mutations than on those with wild-type RAS (Table 2 and Fig 2A).
Train_Line_2802 Recently, Thol et al and Patnaik et al identified IDH1 mutation as an independent poor prognostic factor in MDS patients.
Train_Line_2803 Asxl1 knockout mice have a mild defect in hematopoiesis, predominantly in lymphopoiesis.

Train_Line_2805 The mutations affecting the spliceosome complex were found to be apparently mutually exclusive in prior studies of Yoshida et al and Makishima et al.
Train_Line_2806 Heretofore, MPL has been sequenced in a small cohort of patients with MF and ET, but no mutations were identified, and multiple groups have reported the absence of EPOR mutations in small numbers of patients with PV.
Train_Line_2807 The presence of the JAK2V617F 46/1 predisposition genotype (haplotype), indicated by a "yes," corresponds to a heterozygous state.
Train_Line_2808 Univariate analysis revealed, as previously described, that FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations and MLL partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD) mutations were associated with reduced overall survival (P = 0.001 for FLT3-ITD and P = 0.009 for MLL-PTD) (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix), whereas CEBPA mutations and core-binding-factor alterations t(8;21) and inv(16)/t(16;16) were associated with improved overall survival (P = 0.05 for CEBPA and P<0.001 for the core-binding-factor alterations).
Train_Line_2809 To define cooperating genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that are associated with primary chromosomal translocations during the development of leukemia, we focused on a 3-year-old female monozygotic twin pair that is discordant for MLL-associated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and has been morphologically classified as FAB-M5 (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_2810 Mutations in ASXL1 are frameshifts and stop mutations located within the 12th exon of the gene; they usually affect only one copy of the gene and result in the loss of the carboxyterminal PHD domain.
Train_Line_2811 The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the distribution of OS and time to AML progression and to compare differences between survival curves, respectively.
Train_Line_2812 7.2.2 Postremission therapy according to cytogenetic and molecular genetic risk.
Train_Line_2813 * The receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT is mutated in several types of cancer, notably gastrointestinal tumours (GIST), systemic mastocytosis and subsets of acute myeloid leukaemia and melanoma.
Train_Line_2814 On the basis of the log-log incidence of MPN with age (that increases after 60 years), mathematical models suggested that a single mutation, such as JAK2V617F, although providing a minor advantage to HSC, may cause a MPN with a very long latency (> 45 years).
Train_Line_2815 Recently, the animal models showed that C-terminal-truncating ASXL1 mutations or deletion/loss of ASXL1 lead to MDS-like disease in mice.
Train_Line_2816 Mice that are homozygous null for Dnmt3a-/- are born runted, die of aganglionic megacolon, and males lack germ cells.
Train_Line_2817 Nonetheless, calendar age alone should not be a reason for not offering potentially curative therapy to an older patient, because age is not the most important prognostic factor for either TRM or resistance to therapy.
Train_Line_2818 The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML.
Train_Line_2819 American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines recommend a threshold of 10 x 109/L for prophylactic platelet transfusions.
Train_Line_2820 The current study signifies the adverse prognostic effect of mutant IDH1 on both overall and leukemia-free survival in MDS.
Train_Line_2821 Of note, there was no significant difference in clinical parameters between high and low expressers, but patients with low ASXL1 expression harbored more mutations in IDH1 (P = .012; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_2822 Quite surprisingly, overexpression of C/EBPalpha in two prostate cancer cell lines led to increased proliferation rates, the mechanism of which was not defined.
Train_Line_2823 Together these results support a mild loss of function for the SH2B3 PH domain point mutants.
Train_Line_2824 Thus, BRCC3 likely plays a role as tumor-associated gene in myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_2825 To determine the frequency and the prognostic significance of this mutation, we retrospectively evaluated 23 patients with platelet counts more than 600x109/L, 15% ringed sideroblasts or more, and at least erythroid marrow dysplasia.
Train_Line_2826 Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests compared, respectively, categoric and continuous variables.
Train_Line_2827 The correlations of U2AF1 mutation with the patients' clinical features are summarized in Table I.
Train_Line_2828 IDH1/2 MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_2829 Alternatively, mutations may alter the biology of MDS cells in a way that is not captured by clinical parameters, demonstrating that the determination of mutation status for specific genes is critical for the evaluation and treatment of lowerrisk MDS.
Train_Line_2830 Vasomotor symptoms in ET constitute headaches, lightheadedness, transient neurologic or ocular disturbances, tinnitus, atypical chest discomfort, paresthesias, and erythromelalgia (painful and burning sensation of the feet or hands associated with erythema and warmth).
Train_Line_2831 When the mutations were not obvious because of location near the sequencing primers, sequencing from the other direction was done to solve this issue.
Train_Line_2832 This and other observations support the notion that TET2 mutation can lead per se to increased hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and clonal myeloid proliferation.
Train_Line_2833 This suggests that the ASXL1 mutation may follow a JAK2 mutation and could therefore help predict the risk of evolution from PV and ET to MF.
Train_Line_2834 Idarubicin differs from the other anthracyclines because it is more lipophilic favoring an increased placental transfer and has a higher DNA affinity; thus, daunorubicin should be given rather than idarubicin.
Train_Line_2835 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_2836 The YY2 gene shares many structural and functional features with YY1, the transcriptional repression activity of which is under control of the NPM1 gene, which is frequently mutated in AML.
Train_Line_2837 Previously, it has been shown that the survival of RARS-T patients as a whole is shorter than that of patients with typical ET.
Train_Line_2838 As expected, 3 of the 8 cases of JMML tested carried mutations (G60R, D61V and G503A).
Train_Line_2839 Finally, SOCS3 methylation was not significantly correlated with survival or other clinical variables.
Train_Line_2840 Some of these procedures were followed by confirmation using Sanger sequencing, as previously described.
Train_Line_2841 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_2842 Whole genome sequencing: A procedure that allows to sequence the coding and non coding regions of a genome.
Train_Line_2843 The adverse impact of TP53 persists after adjustment for cytogenetic risk and is of practical importance in evaluating prognosis.
Train_Line_2844 Moreover, biochemical, biological, and epigenomic analyses of the effects of these mutations have informed the development of novel therapies which target pathways deregulated by these mutations.
Train_Line_2845 Controls included DNA from the bone marrow biopsies of three patients with PV and from 11 patients with RARS with platelet counts >=400x109/L but <600x109/L.
Train_Line_2846 In human hematopoiesis, knocking down TET2 transiently favors monocytic differentiation at the expense of the granulocytic differentiation and decreases the proliferation of erythroid progenitors (F.D., unpublished data, June 2011).
Train_Line_2847 Multivariate analysis including age, International Prognostic Scoring System, transfusion dependency, and mutational status confirmed a significant inferior OS to patients with a BCOR mutation (hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-8.1; P = .008).
Train_Line_2848 Trizol messenger RNA (mRNA) extraction from diagnostic BM mononuclear cells of 35 MDS patients and 20 non-MDS patients was followed by reverse transcription (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Train_Line_2849 The small sample size and non-uniform treatment precludes an assessment of the impact of DNMT3A mutations on response to DNMT inhibitors in this cohort.
Train_Line_2850 Figure 2. The DNA methylation and demethylation pathway, and effect of TET2 and IDH1/2 mutations on epigenetic DNA and histone modifications. (A) The DNMT family of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B) each may place a methyl group on the C5 position of DNA cytosine residues in a reaction which requires SAM as a cofactor. (B) Members of the TET family of enzymes (TET1, TET2, TET3) may then oxidize 5-mC to 5hmC an enzymatic reaction which requires Fe(II) and a-KG as substrates. The TET family may also then iteratively oxidize 5hmC further to 5-formylcytosine followed by 5-caC. 5-caC can be directly recognized by the enzyme TDG followed by excision with the BER pathway (an enzymatic activity that is unable to excise 5hmC or 5-mC) to generate unmethylated cytosine. The AID-APOBEC DNA repair pathway can also convert 5hmC to 5-hydroxymethyluracil which activates the BER using TDG or the SMUG1 to generate unmethylated cytosines. TET-mediated enzymatic processes are dependent on a-KG. The presence of an IDH1/2 mutation results in the production of 2-HG, which is structurally very similar to a-KG and can compete with a-KG to inhibit a-KG-dependent enzymatic processes. This includes inhibition of the a-KG-dependent family of JMJC containing histone demethylases. JMJC histone demethylases are responsible for demethylation of histone 3H residues at amino acid residues 2, 4, 9, 27, and 36 and histone H4 amino acid residue 3. 5-cac, 5- carboxylcytosine; AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; APOBEC, apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic; BER, base-excision repair; SMUG1, single-strandselective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase; TDG, thymine DNA glycosylase.
Train_Line_2851 The cohort was followed up to June 2011 for disease progression, survival and response to treatment.
Train_Line_2852 For germline control, DNA was obtained from paired CD31 T cells.

Train_Line_2854 Both IPSS and WPSS were modeled as continuous covariates, as the likelihood ratio test of each model compared with the respective one having a categorical parameterization showed no significant difference between these alternatives.
Train_Line_2855 Indef pendent validation of the detected variants with the use of classic Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of 2 to 12 somatic mutations per patient (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2856 Fig 2. Map of mutation in relation to TP53 protein, to scale. Thirty patients had 40 mutations of TP53, predominantly localized to the DNA binding domain.
Train_Line_2857 Likelihood ratio tests were carried out to compare nested models with different covariates and parameterizations (eg, categorical vs continuous), and to test for interaction between covariates.
Train_Line_2858 TP53 mutation analysis.
Train_Line_2859 Whereas the genetic basis for CML has been known for more than 30 years, the specific genetic events that contribute to the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis remained unknown until 2005.
Train_Line_2860 Finally, the LNK mutation could be accompanied by JAK2 V617F.
Train_Line_2861 Multivariate analysis revealed that FLT3-ITD mutations constituted the primary predictor of outcome in patients with intermediate-risk AML (adjusted P<0.001).

Train_Line_2863 This suggests that splice gene mutations play a causal role in the disease course.
Train_Line_2864 Fig 5. SH2B3 PH domain mutants retain their binding to JAK2, CBL and 14-3-3. 293T cells were co-transfected with either WT JAK2 (A) or CBL (C) and either WT or mutant SH2B3. Protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with V5 antibodies and analysed by Western blot as indicated. (B) 293T cells were transfected with either WT or mutant SH2B3. Protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with V5 antibodies and analysed by Western blot as indicated.
Train_Line_2865 The resulting alterations reside within the second zinc finger of GATA2, which mediates DNA-binding and protein-protein interactions.
Train_Line_2866 With a median follow-up period of 60.2 months, patients with SRSF2 mutation had an inferior OS than those without this mutation (median, 33.9 months vs 19.0 months, P = .010; Figure 1A).
Train_Line_2867 These amplicons were subjected to massive parallel sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using TruSeq custom primers (Illumina) and SureSelect (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with paired-end reads, according to the manufacture's instruction.
Train_Line_2868 AML with minimal differentiation is an AML without morphologic and cytochemical evidence of myeloid differentiation.
Train_Line_2869 Assessment for CALR mutations markedly improves the current diagnostic approach for essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis and may be a useful addition to the World Health Organization criteria for these disorders.
Train_Line_2870 R140Q was the most common IDH2 mutation (15 of 19, 79%).
Train_Line_2871 Our data suggest that RARS-T patients positive for JAK2V617F have a more favorable prognosis than patients without the JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_2872 The Ras superfamily includes small GTP-binding proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction.
Train_Line_2873 Therefore, a total of 31 patients had ASXL1 mutations at both MDS diagnosis and subsequent follow-ups (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 3).
Train_Line_2874 For this clone to become fully dominant in the whole body, the mutated stem cells must have additional advantages.
Train_Line_2875 After removal of low-quality and clonal reads, the mean depth of the covered exome was 69-fold (tumor) and 66-fold (normal; median, 51-fold and 49-fold, respectively), with 99% of the target exome being covered by at least 1 read and 87%-88% by at least 10 reads (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_2876 Patients with CMML had a high incidence (53.8%) of ASXL1 mutations (Table 1).
Train_Line_2877 I recommend the use of low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day; range 40-100 mg/day) in all patients with low-risk PV or ET, provided there are no major contraindications; the latter include clinically significant (ristocetin cofactor activity of <20-30%) AvWS that might be associated with extreme thrombocytosis (i.e. platelet count over 1 million/micL).
Train_Line_2878 The spectrum of a-KG-dependent enzymes impaired by the presence of IDH1/2 mutations and/or 2-HG include the TET family of enzymes and the Jumonji-C domain-containing (JMJC) family of histone lysine demethylases (Figure 2).
Train_Line_2879 Determination of genes differentially expressed in the presence of GATA2 mutants. HL-60 cell lines were treated with 100 nM 4HT to turn on wild-type and mutant GATA2 protein expression. After 24 h, gene expression levels were determined by microarray (Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_2880 Three patients with MDS, unclassifiable, by WHO classification were excluded from this statistical analysis.
Train_Line_2881 In multivariable analysis for overall survival, TP53 alterations, white blood cell counts, and age were the only significant factors.
Train_Line_2882 The only notable difference was that patients with the SF3B1 mutations had a higher BM RS% (P < 0.0001), lower median white blood cell count (P = 0.04), and a lower absolute lymphocyte count (P = 0.045).
Train_Line_2883 The IPSS stratification was low in 39 patients, intermediate-1 in 57, intermediate-2 in 38, and high in 13 (information on IPSS score was not available for 46 patients).
Train_Line_2884 The active conformation may be stabilized by phosphorylation of Y823.
Train_Line_2885 Because of the low frequency of IDH1 mutations occurring in MDS the prognostic impact of the mutation should be confirmed in larger groups of uniformly treated MDS patients and put in context with other novel markers such as TET2, ASXL1 and RUNX1.
Train_Line_2886 RESULTS.
Train_Line_2887 However, other mutations of LNK have been found in leukemic transformation of MPN at a greater frequency (j13%).
Train_Line_2888 Other driver mutations such as ASXL1, SRSF2, and STAG2 were detected at higher frequencies in the stem cell compartment but were also found in 35% of B lymphocytes, indicating an appearance of these mutations at an early multipotent stage of hematopoietic differentiation.
Train_Line_2889 We identified mutations in 35 of the 40 selected genes, >= one of which were present in 92% of samples (Fig 1; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_2890 Of these 234 patients, 155 (66%) were treated on consecutive multicenter treatment trials of the German-Austrian AML Study Group (AMLSG) applying age-adjusted intensive chemotherapy: AML HD93 (n = 1), AML HD98A (n = 30), and AMLSG 07-04 (n = 54; NCT00151242) for younger patients (16-60 years); and AML HD98B (n = 27) and AMLSG 06-04 (n = 43; NCT00151255) for elderly patients (> 60 years).
Train_Line_2891 The diagnosis of AML was based on FrenchAmerican-British Cooperative Group criteria, and after 2004 on WHO criteria.
Train_Line_2892 Annette H. Schmitt-Graeff; Soon-Siong Teo; Manfred Olschewski; Franz Schaub; Sabine Haxelmans; Andreas Kirn; Petra Reinecke; Ulrich Germing; Radek C. Skoda.
Train_Line_2893 There was no difference in hemoglobin levels and platelet counts between the patients with and without ASXL1 mutation.
Train_Line_2894 This property is specific (or enhanced) for the mutant protein and has been shown to disrupt the interaction between PRMT5 and its cofactor MEP50, leading to a decreased methyltransferase activity.
Train_Line_2895 It is important to underscore that although this was an intent-to-treat analysis, the actual amount of cytarabine administered to patients in each of the consolidation arms was not different between the mutated RAS and wild-type RAS groups (not shown).
Train_Line_2896 The GATA2-responsive promoter (LYL1) and enhancer (RUNX1) were PCR amplified and cloned into pGL4.12[luc2CP] (SfiI) and pGL3-Promoter (KpnI/BglII) (Promega), respectively.
Train_Line_2897 Observed mutations are mainly small insertions and deletions and nonsense mutations that are expected to result in the loss of function of the protein.
Train_Line_2898 A novel mutation in codon R140 of IDH2 was identified in two patients with leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms as well as in patients with AML.
Train_Line_2899 Previously reported patterns of mutations were observed.
Train_Line_2900 More studies are needed to clarify the clinical implication of IDH mutations in MDS.
Train_Line_2901 The assembly of the spliceosome occurs anew on each premRNA, which contains specific sequences that drive and regulate this process.
Train_Line_2902 Its expression is diminished or undetectable in the majority of human and mouse squamous cell carcinomas and is associated with Ras expression.
Train_Line_2903 However, since the large majority of RARS patients, including our control group with RARS, do not carry the mutation, the occurrence of JAK2V617F on the background of RARS is obviously a rare event.
Train_Line_2904 With a median follow up of 43.3 months (range 0.1-250.7 months), mutations of ASXL1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, EZH2, and SRSF2, as well as older age, poor-risk karyotype, high IPSS score and high IPSS-R score were associated with poor OS (Table V).
Train_Line_2905 Statistics.
Train_Line_2906 Targeting KIT downstream signalling.
Train_Line_2907 Intriguingly, in MDS patients with normal karyotype, ASXL1 mutation was also an independent poor prognostic factor.
Train_Line_2908 Therefore, it is important that previous therapies be meticulously documented and reported.
Train_Line_2909 All cultures contained 50 units/ml penicillin and 50 mug/ml streptomycin (Sigma).
Train_Line_2910 5.1 Patient-related factors.
Train_Line_2911 The diagnosis of post-PV or post-ET MF had to adhere to criteria recently published by the International Working Group for MPN Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT; Table III).
Train_Line_2912 The calypso/BAP1 DUB deubiquitylates K119ub on histone H2A, leading to gene repression.
Train_Line_2913 Recently, ineffective erythropoiesis and high levels of apoptosis have been ascribed to not yet explained molecular alterations in RARS-T which may abolish the effect of JAK2 activation.
Train_Line_2914 There were no significant differences in survival for patients stratified by age (>= 60 v < 60 years), sex, or donor sex.
Train_Line_2915 Recently, the European LeukemiaNet proposed that NPM mutated/FLT3 wild-type patients with CN-AML should be considered as a favorable risk group separately from patients with FLT3-ITD CN-AML with wild-type NPM1 CN-AML.
Train_Line_2916 Among these, NPM1 mutations and biallelic CEBPA mutations are likely to be primary genetic events, as shown by their specificity for AML, high stability at relapse, mutual exclusion of other recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities, expression in leukemic stem cells, unique gene expression signatures, and distinct microRNA profiles.
Train_Line_2917 One patient had a novel mutation: P95_D97del (c.283_291del), a 9-base pair deletion that resulted in a 3-amino acid deletion starting from Pro95 (supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_2918 However, higher doses, especially in combination with the kinase inhibitor, caused liver toxicity.
Train_Line_2919 Age at disease onset ranged from 44 to 70 years.
Train_Line_2920 These mice exhibit an initial phase of neutropenia and go on to develop overt AML with full penetrance.
Train_Line_2921 SRSF2 mutation was closely associated with male sex (P = .001) and older age (P < .001).
Train_Line_2922 Interestingly, platelet count more than 1,000 x 10(9)/L was associated with a lower risk of arterial thrombosis.
Train_Line_2923 Results.
Train_Line_2924 Outside clinical trials, repeat marrow aspirates may not be needed, and should be done only if blood counts become abnormal.
Train_Line_2925 Response assessment during follow-up period.
Train_Line_2926 However, the initial reports of the two recent trials did not identify whether dose-intensified induction therapy improved the outcomes in various AML subgroups.
Train_Line_2927 To compare regression models with different covariate cut-off points, we used the Akaike information criterion.
Train_Line_2928 In cohort 1, isolation of blast cells, DNA extraction (n = 171), or mRNA extraction (n = 29) and random-primed cDNA synthesis was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_2929 The JMML and Noonan syndrome mutant immunocomplexes had significantly greater phosphatase activities than did wild-type immunocomplexes (Fig. 1a).
Train_Line_2930 The median follow-up time for patients alive was calculated according to the method of Korn.
Train_Line_2931 In particular, mutational heterogeneity was greater in patients with intermediate-risk AML than in patients with favorable-risk or unfavorable-risk risk AML (P = 0.01) (Fig. S2D in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_2932 Sample Processing, DNA Sequencing, and Mutation Analysis.
Train_Line_2933 SF3B1 was also mutated in smaller proportions of patients with other tumor types.
Train_Line_2934 Fifty six (62%) patients among the 90 SRSF2-mutated cohort had a diploid karyotype whereas trisomy 8 (n = 5), monosomy 7/deletion 7q (n = 4,), 2y (n = 4), deletion 20q (n = 2), complex karyotype (n = 2), monosomal karyotype (n = 1), trisomy 11 (n = 1), deletion 13q (n = 1), and isochromosome 17q (n = 1) were included among the abnormal cytogenetic findings in the remaining.
Train_Line_2935 This Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System (LR-PSS) considers many of the same risk factors as the IPSS, including cytogenetic abnormalities, the proportion of blasts in the bone marrow, and the presence of specific cytopenias, albeit with modifications to the thresholds and relative weights of different parameters (Table 1).
Train_Line_2936 In most eukaryotes, including humans, there are 2 classes of introns: the common U2 type, representing more than 99% of human introns, and the rare U12 type, with the 2 differing in their consensus splice-site sequences.
Train_Line_2937 Identification of such predisposing genes to familial forms of MDS and AML is critical for more effective diagnosis and prognosis, counseling, selection of related bone marrow transplant donors and development of therapies.
Train_Line_2938 Management of high-risk PV or ET Summary of randomized studies in PV.
Train_Line_2939 The median overall survival (OS) for the entire patient cohort was 35.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.8-43.2).
Train_Line_2940 TET gene expression.
Train_Line_2941 Residue T670, analogous to T315 in BCR/ABL, is the "gatekeeper" residue located at the entrance to the hinge region of the ATP binding cleft.
Train_Line_2942 Among the 8 patients with SRSF2 mutation, all retained the original mutations in the subsequent samples (Table 4).
Train_Line_2943 To establish whether the SF3B1 mutation status can add to the predictive power of IPSS or WPPS, we fitted multivariable Cox models, including age, sex, IPSS or WPSS, and SF3B1 mutation status.
Train_Line_2944 Patient 34 acquired WT1 mutation at first relapse, which disappeared at second CR but reappeared at second relapse; the same NPM1 mutation detected at diagnosis was retained at first and second relapse.
Train_Line_2945 Current examples of investigational therapies include clofarabine, cloretazine, azacitidine (or decitabine) T histone deacetylase inhibitors or GO, "3 + 7" or LDAC combined with GO, and FLT3 inhibitors in patients with activating FLT3 mutations (see section 11).
Train_Line_2946 Following recent reports of mutations in DNMT3A, SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1 in MDS, we sequenced the recurrently mutated regions of these genes in all samples.
Train_Line_2947 Accession codes.
Train_Line_2948 2.2 Scope of the review.
Train_Line_2949 The mutation was not present in any samples from patients with diseases related to MF, nor in 270 normal samples.
Train_Line_2950 Among the nine patients with IDH mutations, two lost the mutation at remission status after receiving AML directed chemotherapy; one of them relapsed and regained the original mutation.
Train_Line_2951 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_2952 Indicates the Italian unselected CN-AML series; G, German selected CN-AML series comprising: 82 patients with the genotype NPM1wt/CEBPAwt/IDH1wt/FLT3-ITD-negative/MLL-PTD-negative, 58 cases with NPM1 mutations, 10 cases with MLL-PTD, and 10 selected cases with biallelic CEBPA mutations; wt, wild-type; and mut, mutated.
Train_Line_2953 The mutation may be used as a biomarker for risk C stratification.
Train_Line_2954 The specific mutations in PTPN11 associated with isolated JMML occurred as somatic changes but have never been observed as germline defects, which leads us to speculate that these molecular defects are stronger and would be associated with embryonic lethality.
Train_Line_2955 All coding exons for ZRSR2, DNMT3A, EZH2, RUNX1, CEBPA and TET2 were sequenced.
Train_Line_2956 In the current cohort, the same finding also was observed in patients with CMML, but not in those with other subtypes: all 10 CMML patients with SRSF2 mutation had wild-type EZH2 (data not shown).
Train_Line_2957 Table 2. Molecular associations of splice gene mutations (Fisher exact test).
Train_Line_2958 Generation of mutant GATA2 plasmid and lentiviral expression constructs.
Train_Line_2959 There were 2,119 patients with MDS and 466 patients with CMML evaluated at MDACC between January 1997 and December 2010.
Train_Line_2960 In the major U2-dependent spliceosome, the donor site is recognized by the U1 snRNP, whereas the branch site is recognized by the U2 snRNP.
Train_Line_2961 To test the functional importance of loss of function of SETD2 in the development of myeloid leukemias characterized by either MLL translocation or additional genetic aberrations identified in patients, we employed bone marrow transplantation (BMT), as well as colony-forming cell and liquid culture assays, to demonstrate the transforming effects of Setd2 knockdown in vivo and in vitro, respectively.
Train_Line_2962 Despite a low frequency of mutations, BCOR might be considered as a key gene in risk stratification.
Train_Line_2963 Because MDS and associated secondary AML (sAML) are diseases of the elderly, accumulation of mutations and alterations arising from DNA damage has been implicated in disease pathogenesis.
Train_Line_2964 Average sequencing coverage across the gene was around 3509; >95% of the sequenced amplicons had sequence coverage of >1009.
Train_Line_2965 Interestingly, no IDH2 mutations were observed in MDS patients while the incidence of IDH2 mutations in patients with AML arising from MDS was found to be 7.5%.
Train_Line_2966 For these reasons, CBL has been considered a tumor suppressor gene.
Train_Line_2967 The median age of the cohort was 71 years (range, 21-91 years), with 72% of the patients being males.
Train_Line_2968 Contrary to pediatric myeloid malignancies in which different mechanisms can induce activation of the RAS-MEKERK pathway (RAS mutations, NF1 deletions or PTPN11 mutations), in adult myeloid malignancies this activation only exceptionally involves PTPN11 mutations and therefore seems related mostly to RAS mutations.
Train_Line_2969 They noted that the incidence of FLT3-ITD at diagnosis of MDS was significantly lower than that at AML transformation and FLT3-ITD-mutated patients progressed to AML more rapidly than FLT3-ITD wild-type patients (2.5 += 0.5 vs. 11.9 += 1.5 months, P = 0.114).
Train_Line_2970 Hyperleukocytosis, generally defined as a WBC more than 100 x 109/L, is associated with increased induction mortality mainly due to hemorrhagic events, tumor lysis syndrome, and infections.
Train_Line_2971 Sequencing of the C/EBPalpha gene by another group in 36 non- small-cell lung cancers failed to identify any coding sequence mutations.
Train_Line_2972 We did not identify any correlation between the presence of TET2 mutations and overall survival for either MDS or CMML patients.
Train_Line_2973 Indeed, we discovered that DNMT3A and SF3B1 mutations overlapped more often than expected by chance, indicating possible biologic cooperativity between these pathogenic lesions.
Train_Line_2974 HL-60 cells were plated at 1.25 x 104 cells/ml and treated with or without 30 nm 4HT (Sigma) for 24 h and then with or without 2 muM ATRA (Sigma).
Train_Line_2975 ROLE OF C/EBPalpha IN HEMATOPOETIC MALIGNANCIES.
Train_Line_2976 In JAK2V617F-positive patients, LNK expression is increased and modulates the myeloproliferative process.
Train_Line_2977 SRSF2, located at 17q25.1, encodes serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2 that belongs to the serine/arginine-rich protein family, important for splice-site selection, spliceosome assembly, and both constitutive and alternative splicing.
Train_Line_2978 The K700E mutation accounted for more than 50% of the variants observed, and additional codons (666, 662, 622, and 625) were found to be hot spots for mutation.
Train_Line_2979 Five patients (2%) carried the JAK2 V617F mutation, two with RARS and three with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia.
Train_Line_2980 The PCR conditions were 94--degrees--C for 11 min followed by 40 cycles of 94--degrees--C for 30 s, an annealing temperature of 61--degrees--C for 30 s and extension at 72--degrees--C for 30 s with a final extension at 72--degrees--C for 10 min.
Train_Line_2981 No followup information concerning the allelic ratio of JAK2 of this patient was available.
Train_Line_2982 Because there were no significant differences regarding clinical characteristics, response to therapy, and survival for TP53-monoallelic altered and TP53-biallelic altered CK-AMLs (supplemental Table 1; supplemental Figure 2), these genotypes were grouped as TP53-altered CK-AML for further analyses.
Train_Line_2983 As shown in Figure 2, a spliceosome mutation may cause abnormal transcription and various types of abnormal splicing or alternative splicing events.
Train_Line_2984 For instance, a somatic SF3B1 mutation appears to be able to cause a clinical phenotype per se, whereas a driver TET2 mutation can determine clonal hematopoiesis without hematologic manifestations, suggesting that cooperating mutant genes might be required for phenotypic expression.
Train_Line_2985 The precise understanding of the molecular mechanism of these familial forms will be certainly be critical for understanding the pathogenesis of MPN.
Train_Line_2986 In 65 busulfan-treated patients with PV followed between 1962 and 1983, median survival was 19 years in patients whose disease was diagnosed before age 60 years.
Train_Line_2987 Responses of the exon 9 mutant group could be improved by increasing the imatinib dose to 800 mg/day.
Train_Line_2988 Among the 21 IDH-mutated MDS patients (Supporting Information Table S1), 14 had normal karyotype, two had trisomy 8, and two had 7q deletion.
Train_Line_2989 Whereas alterations of DNMT3A have been described previously in AML, we report here for the first time recurrent clonal and somatic BCOR mutations in AML.
Train_Line_2990 But none of the patients with inv(16) showed this gene mutation.
Train_Line_2991 Almost all U2AF35-mut patients were male (11 of 12 = 92%; P = .016), but no significant differences in age, WHO classification, bone marrow blasts, hemoglobin, WBC, platelets, transfusion dependence, or IPSS score were observed.
Train_Line_2992 The high-risk molecular group is defined as either NPM1 wild type/FLT3-ITD negative or NPM1 wild type/FLT3-ITD positive or NPM1 mutated/FLT3-ITD positive. The low-risk molecular group is defined by the presence of an NPM1 mutation and the absence of FLT3-ITD.
Train_Line_2993 For patients with a TET2 or DNMT3A mutation, the adjusted HR for OS was statistically significant and comparable to that for patients with a TP53 mutation (Table 2).
Train_Line_2994 In one BCOR-mutated patient (patient 406II; Figure 3C), a new band corresponding to a lower-MW protein, which likely represents the new truncated protein product (predicted MW, 162 kDa), was detected at much lower intensity than the full-length BCOR protein observed in BCOR-unmutated AML patients.
Train_Line_2995 The diagnostic criteria of the WHO classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues were adopted.
Train_Line_2996 T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by clonal expansion of CD31 cytotoxic T lymphocytes and may be associated with autoimmune disorders and immune-mediated cytopenias.
Train_Line_2997 Average sequencing coverage (X) across the entire TET2 coding region was 130X and > 95% of the sequenced amplicons had sequence coverage more than 40X (> 98% with more than 10X coverage).
Train_Line_2998 A cohort of MDS patients was examined for mutations affecting 4 splice genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and U2AF35) and evaluated in the context of clinical and molecular markers.
Train_Line_2999 There is no hard data that implicates hydroxyurea or busulfan as being leukemogenic in PV or ET.
Train_Line_3000 Combining the Italian and German series, among the 411 CN-AML patients for whom the NPM1 mutation status was known, 197 patients (48%) were NPM1 mutated.
Train_Line_3001 After the discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in spliceosome complex genes in a significant proportion of adult MDS patients by whole exome sequencing studies, it is of interest to know whether there are distinct clinical features in the patients harboring these mutations.
Train_Line_3002 Furthermore, 3.5% of the patients treated with chlorambucil developed large cell lymphoma and the incidence of gastrointestinal and skin cancer was increased in those patients treated with either chlorambucil or radiophosphorus.
Train_Line_3003 Figure 4. MPLW515L and MPLWT Bone Marrow Transplant Model Histopathology Histology of MPLW515L-transduced and MPLWT-transduced Balb/C mice showing images of peripheral blood. (A and B) and histopathology in representative sections of bone marrow (C and D), spleen (E-H), and liver (I-L). Peripheral blood smear (B) (600X, Wright-Giemsa) of a representative MPLWT animal displays an unremarkable white blood cell and platelet count. In contrast, peripheral blood smear (A) (600X, Wright-Giemsa) of a representative MPLW515L mutant animal reveals marked thrombocytosis and leukocytosis comprising a predominant population of maturing myeloid cells as well as frequent nucleated erythroid forms. Bone marrow images from MPLWT animals display preserved marrow architecture with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis (D) (600X, hematoxylin and eosin [H&E]). Comparatively, bone marrow sections from MPLW515L mutant animals demonstrate marrow elements comprising a prominent population of maturing myeloid cells with increased numbers of megakaryocytes including atypical and dysplastic forms occurring in frequent clusters (C) (600X, H&E) and showing emperipolesis of neutrophils in megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Spleen sections from MPLW515L mice display complete effacement of normal splenic architecture (E) (40X, H&E) with a marked expansion of red pulp that is composed of an admixture of maturing myeloid and erythroid elements and numerous numbers of atypical megakaryocytes (G) (600X, H&E) compared with MPLWT spleens (F and H) (40X and 600X, H&E), which display a relative preservation of normal spleen architecture and the presence of only maturing erythroid forms in the red pulp. Liver images from MPLW515L mice illustrate evidence of extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis in a perivascular and sinusoidal distribution (I) (1003, H&E) composed predominantly of a population of maturing erythroid elements with frequent large atypical megakaryocytes and occasional admixed myeloid forms (K) (600X, H&E). In comparison, only small, focal areas of nucleated erythroid cells were observed in livers from MPLWT animals (J and L) (100X and 600X, H&E). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030270.g004
Train_Line_3004 Importantly, these additional mutations were all located within the conserved domains of TET2, suggesting that these are not functionally silent events.
Train_Line_3005 Cases were classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) system upon banking of their bone marrow specimens.
Train_Line_3006 RARS-T patients with JAK2V617F have a more favorable prognosis than those without the JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_3007 This might be the case, for example, if a patient with SF3B1-mutated RARS acquires an ASXL1 mutation and progresses to a condition characterized by multilineage dysplasia or excess of blasts in addition to ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_3008 These arms included four cycles of (1) 100 mg/m2 of cytarabine as a continuous infusion x 5 days, (2) 400 mg/m2 of cytarabine as a continuous infusion x 5 days, or (3) 3 g/m2 of cytarabine over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5.
Train_Line_3009 The IPSS-R clearly represents a step forward but does take into account only cytogenetic abnormalities, which are secondary genetic events and not the driver lesions.
Train_Line_3010 PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_3011 The analysis of 12 other gene mutations in the current cohort demonstrated that SRSF2 mutation was closely associated with RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations.
Train_Line_3012 We found the same, previously unidentified heterozygous c.1061C>T (p.Thr354Met) missense mutation in the GATA2 transcription factor gene segregating with the multigenerational transmission of MDS-AML in three families and a GATA2 c.1063_1065delACA (p.Thr355del) mutation at an adjacent codon in a fourth MDS family.
Train_Line_3013 Mutation analyses of other 14 relevant molecular genes, including Class I mutations, such as FLT3-ITD, N-RAS, K-RAS, JAK2, and PTPN11 mutations, and Class II mutations, such as MLL-PTD, RUNX1, and WT1 mutations, as well as mutations of genes involving in epigenetic modifications, such as ASXL1, DNMT3A, and EZH2 mutations, and splicing machinery mutations, such as U2AF1, SRSF2, and SF3B1 mutations, were performed as previously described.
Train_Line_3014 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3015 The increased self-renewal potential of C/EBPalpha-/- HSCs may, at least in part, be due to elevated expression of the polycomb gene Bmi-1.
Train_Line_3016 Thus IDH1/IDH2 mutations are associated with MPN transformation, but clonal hierarchy and follow-up studies are needed to better define whether they promote the initiation or the progression of MPN to AML.
Train_Line_3017 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_3018 MPLW515L activates JAK-STAT signal transduction independently of ligand binding, and, in contrast with MPLWT, confers cytokine-independent growth to 32D, Ba/F3, and UT7 cells.
Train_Line_3019 The presence of 15% RS constitutes the operational diagnosis of MDS-RS.
Train_Line_3020 In this study, the monosomal karyotype was defined by the presence of one single monosomy (excluding isolated loss of X or Y) in association with at least one additional monosomy or structural chromosome abnormality (excluding core-binding factor [CBF] AML).
Train_Line_3021 One microarray study identified downregulation of C/EBPalpha as a marker for extensive lymph node metastases.
Train_Line_3022 Mutational Analysis.
Train_Line_3023 Ten patients whose myelofibrosis had transformed from an MPD (5 with PV, 5 with ET of whom one was JAK2 V617F-positive) were also assessed.
Train_Line_3024 CD34+ cell purity was evaluated with FACS and was > 90%.
Train_Line_3025 Several pathways act downstream of KIT to affect cell survival and proliferation.
Train_Line_3026 Forty patients had AML secondary to MDS.
Train_Line_3027 It was shown that PKC412 could be docked into a model of the active FMS kinase (based on PDB 1PKG), however, it could not be docked into an inactive conformation crystal structure of FMS).
Train_Line_3028 This phenotype may be acquired, for example, related to changes in the hematopoietic environment or in the germline.
Train_Line_3029 RNA splicing machinery, a highly regulated process, is a critical step for the maturation from pre-mRNA to mRNA.
Train_Line_3030 The treatment most likely to cure t-AML is allogeneic HSCT.
Train_Line_3031 Spliceosome mutations are rarely found in childhood myeloid neoplasms, suggesting that they are typically acquired in the elderly.
Train_Line_3032 Survival to day 100 after HSCT for MDS is an important clinical time point, after which the risk of relapse begins to outweigh the risk of transplantation-related mortality.
Train_Line_3033 Furthermore, geneexpression profiling revealed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with down-regulation of key gene networks, including core mitochondrial pathways.
Train_Line_3034 Overall survival was calculated from the date of first referral to date of death (uncensored) or last contact (censored).
Train_Line_3035 Of note, similar values for SF3B1 mutant allele burden were found in CD34+ cells and circulating granulocytes (40.6% vs 40.9%; supplemental Figure 2), indicating that somatic mutations occur in multipotent hematopoietic stem cells and are then transmitted to their myeloid progeny.
Train_Line_3036 Somatic mutations in DNA repair genes such as TP53 have thus been sought in cancers.
Train_Line_3037 More recently, JAK2 was also shown to promote G-CSF-R cell-surface localization.
Train_Line_3038 8.3 Cautions and future directions.
Train_Line_3039 BCOR and BCORL1 mutations were found in 7.4% and 1.8% of 54 CMML patients.
Train_Line_3040 Mutations in ASXL1 (additional sex combs 1) have been identified in MDS and other myeloid malignancies, like acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_3041 The mutation status may be changed in some patients during AML progression.
Train_Line_3042 With the exception of 1 patient in whom the BCOR mutation occurred before the DNMT3A and the BCORL1 mutation (Figure 2: UPN9), BCOR mutations presented at low frequency, suggesting they were not involved in disease-initiating events.
Train_Line_3043 Loss of LNK accelerates the development of MPN induced by JAK2V617F in murine models.
Train_Line_3044 All statistical analyses considered clinical and laboratory parameters obtained at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic, which in most instances coincided with time of bone marrow biopsy at the Mayo Clinic and study sample collection.
Train_Line_3045 Figure 1. Diagnostic algorithm. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]
Train_Line_3046 U2AF35-mut patients had an increased prevalence of chromosome 20 deletions and ASXL1 mutations.
Train_Line_3047 However, in cases in which JAK2V617F is not the initiating event, this approach may revert the MPN hematopoiesis to a pre-JAK2 clonal hematopoiesis (pre-JAK2 disorder) with the risk of developing other malignant blood disorders.
Train_Line_3048 Fig 4. HEL cells (JAK2 V617F) were transduced with either WT or mutant Sh2b3. (A) GFP positive cells were sorted, plated at equal cell densities in liquid culture and counted every 2 days. Results represent the mean SD of triplicated samples. Transduced cells were serum-starved for 8 hours and studied for STAT5 and ERK Phosphorylation.(B) Gating of GFP positive cells.(C)STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation. MFls were normalized to the vector control transduced cells and are represented as fold-change.(D) Western blot analysis of protein from transduced HEL cells. (E) Sorted GFP positive HEL cells transduced with either a vector control, WT Sh2b3, Sh2b3 RE or EQ were Serum-starved for 8 hours and analyzed for STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation. Western blot band intensity was normalized to ACTB and represent fold change compared to the vector control.
Train_Line_3049 Previous studies of TET2 mutations have used conventional Sanger sequencing, which is constrained by a high cost and limitation in sensitivity, making this technology unsuitable for large-scale sequencing projects and inefficient in mutation screening.
Train_Line_3050 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments were directly sequenced and were analyzed by using the Sequencing Analysis 5.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and Vector NTI Advance 10 software (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).
Train_Line_3051 In the AMLSG AML HD98B trial, intensive consolidation (idarubicin 12 mg/m2 on days 1 and 3; etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1-5) was superior to a mild 1-year oral maintenance therapy (idarubicin 5 mg per os (p.o.) on days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13; etoposide 100 mg p.o. on days 1 and 13; q4 weeks).
Train_Line_3052 Other treatment modalities that have been reported to be useful in PV-associated pruritus include JAK inhibitors, IFN-a and narrow-band ultraviolet B phototherapy.
Train_Line_3053 When we compared the expression of DDX41 between responders (n = 9) and refractory cases (n = 10), responders showed significantly lower DDX41 mRNA levels (Figure 3F).
Train_Line_3054 Seventeen (85%) of the 20 U2AF35-mutated patients had a diploid karyotype, 2 (10%) had a monosomal karyotype, while one patient had isochromosome 14q; karyotypic risk categories based on the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system were; 2 (10%) high risk, 1 (5%) intermediate risk, and 17 (85%) low risk.
Train_Line_3055 Quantification of SOCS3 promoter methylation was next assessed in purified granulocytes and/or peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a total of 37 MF patients of whom 27 had not been previously assessed (Figure 2D).
Train_Line_3056 Background.
Train_Line_3057 Mutations in IDH1 (at Arg132) or in IDH2 (at Arg140 or Arg172) confer a new enzymatic function to these enzymes, with acquisition of the ability to convert a-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) via the conversion of NADPH to NADP+ (Figure 2).
Train_Line_3058 Sequence changes were confirmed by resequencing in both directions.
Train_Line_3059 Evaluation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression levels.
Train_Line_3060 Activating mutations of KIT in GIST were first reported by Hirota and co-workers.
Train_Line_3061 However, clinically-relevant AvWS can occur even when the platelet count is well below 1,000 x 109/L, and that laboratory evaluation of AvWS must be performed in the presence of abnormal bleeding, regardless of platelet count.
Train_Line_3062 In this study, 79% of patients with RARS, 57.7% of those with RCMD-RS, and 66.7% of those with RARS-T carried somatic mutations of SF3B1 (Table 1).
Train_Line_3063 SF3B1-mut patients presented with lower hemoglobin levels, increased WBC and platelet counts, and were more likely to have DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_3064 Summary of randomized studies in ET.
Train_Line_3065 Antibodies used were allophycocyanin-conjugated Gr-1, B220, Ter119, CD8, cKit; and phycoerythrin-conjugated Mac-1, CD19, CD71, CD4, CD41 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, California, United States).
Train_Line_3066 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3067 This suggests that the myelodysplastic features of various myeloid neoplasms may reflect common underlying genetic lesions and that these latter contribute to determining clinical phenotypes.
Train_Line_3068 Acute myeloid leukemia-related precursor neoplasms include "therapyrelated myelodysplastic syndrome" and "myeloid sarcoma."
Train_Line_3069 HLA typing and CMV testing should be performed in those patients eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_3070 DNA from 65 healthy blood donors (age range, 18 to 60 years) was obtained from the Institute of Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School.
Train_Line_3071 There remain open questions regarding the number of cycles, the most appropriate dose and schedule, and the role of combining HiDAC with other agents.
Train_Line_3072 There were 4 patients in the study with >50% BM RS and all 4 (100%) had SF3B1 mutations, confirming a strong phenotypic correlation with this mutation.
Train_Line_3073 Because the sensitivity of Sanger sequencing allows the detection of heterozygous mutations only when present in a major clonal population, sequence variants reported in < 25% of the reads were not included in this validation phase.
Train_Line_3074 KIT mutations alone do not seem to be sufficient for transformation; thus identification and co-targeting of synergistic oncogenic pathways should lead to improved outcomes.
Train_Line_3075 In the remaining 10 patients (18%) with mutational abundance of >= 65% RMA, the increased mutation burden was consistent, with a genomic aberration at the TET2 locus (see below).
Train_Line_3076 For patients with double WT1 mutations, Taq polymerase-amplified cloning was performed to determine whether the 2 mutations were in the same or different alleles as previously described.
Train_Line_3077 The broad range of individual genes affected by mutations indicates that a variety of molecular mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders.
Train_Line_3078 Aspirin therapy is also considered to be adequate, and potentially useful in preventing complications during pregnancy, especially in JAK2V617F-positive cases.
Train_Line_3079 It is commonly accepted that the AML phenotype results from multiple genetic/epigenetic lesions affecting differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.
Train_Line_3080 One approach evaluated in a multicenter trial is a sequential strategy of intensive chemotherapy followed, after 3 days of rest, by RIC for allogeneic HSCT, and prophylactic administration of donor lymphocyte infusions.
Train_Line_3081 Our group has recently found that DNMT3A mutations are common (22% frequency) in de novo AML and are associated with poor survival, providing a rationale for screening patients with de novo MDS and secondary AML for mutations in DNMT3A.
Train_Line_3082 Interestingly, SH2B3 mutations were described in 7% of CMML samples and may co-occur with CBL mutations (Oh et al 2010b), suggesting they may collaborate.
Train_Line_3083 Our prior study showed that SRSF2 mutation was also stable during the disease evolution.
Train_Line_3084 When overexpressed in 32D/EPOR cells, the SH2B3 W262R variant inhibited Epo-dependent cell growth to the same extent as WT SH2B3.
Train_Line_3085 Also, the transcription of genes that are normally expressed in other lineages is actively suppressed, driving cells away from granulocytic differentiation toward other differentiation pathways.
Train_Line_3086 Leukapheresis is an option for the initial management of hyperleukocytosis; however, no impact on long-term outcome has been shown.
Train_Line_3087 Classifying and mapping mutations.
Train_Line_3088 A number of agents with FLT3 inhibitory activity are being developed although experience in MDS is limited.
Train_Line_3089 Expression of MPLW515L in 32D, UT7, or Ba/F3 cells conferred cytokine-independent growth and thrombopoietin hypersensitivity, and resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, STAT5, AKT, and ERK.
Train_Line_3090 Future studies will be needed to determine whether there are additional subgroups of patients with AML who will benefit from doseintensified induction therapy and whether doseintensified induction therapy improves the outcome in patients with AML who are older than 60 years of age and have mutations in DNMT3A or NPM1 or MLL translocations.
Train_Line_3091 Additional mutant genes, including ASXL1, CBL, ETV6, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, KRAS, NPM1, NRAS, RUNX1, and TP53, have been identified in smaller proportions of patients, particularly in those with high risk of leukemic evolution.
Train_Line_3092 Survival data were available for 47 of the 50 IMF patients assessed.
Train_Line_3093 The germline DDX41 mutations induce MDS/leukemia with long latency but significant penetrance.
Train_Line_3094 Risk stratification based on the MDAPS was; 1 (5%) high risk, 3 (15%) intermediate-2 risk, 5 (25%) intermediate-1 risk, and 11 (55%) low risk.
Train_Line_3095 Includes: del in region K550_E561; K550I; W557R; V559A; V559D; V560D; G565R; Y568C; del D579; F584S.
Train_Line_3096 There was no significant difference in OS and RFS between patients with frame-shift mutations and other mutations (P < .987 and P < .99, respectively).
Train_Line_3097 Additional analyses in larger patient cohorts are required to confirm this observation.
Train_Line_3098 Several of the genes reported in Table 3 can also be mutated in PMF, in combination with JAK2 (V617F) or MPL exon 10 mutations, and comutation has been shown to have a negative impact on the clinical course of this MPN.
Train_Line_3099 The oncogenic kinase Flt3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) phosphorylates C/EBPalpha on ser21 thereby inhibiting granulocytic differentiation.
Train_Line_3100 MPLW515L-transduced animals, but not MPLWT-transduced animals, developed a short latency (median latency = 18 days post BMT), fully penetrant, lethal MPD (Figure 3A) notable for marked thrombocytosis (mean platelet count = 3.414 x 1012/L) as well as leukocytosis (mean WBC = 201 x 109/L) (Figure 3B).
Train_Line_3101 The median follow-up time for the patients included in the analysis, calculated from the time of randomization for induction therapy, was 47.4 months.
Train_Line_3102 It is now known that more than 80% of cases display KIT mutations resulting in constitutive activation, while a smaller proportion (~6%) of cases have mutations in the closely related PDGFR.
Train_Line_3103 Among CMML patients, there was no OS difference between SRSF2-mutated and SRSF2-wild patients, either (Figure 1H).
Train_Line_3104 Whole genome sequencing studies have shown that in hematopoietic stem cells, their number may range from about 100 to 1000, depending on age.
Train_Line_3105 SM and AML.
Train_Line_3106 In accordance with an earlier study, we did not find an impact on OS for U2AF1 mutations.
Train_Line_3107 In total, 82 variants were initially identified in the TET2 gene in 65 (18.3%) patients from total bone marrow DNA, where the proportion of sequence reads containing the variant (RMA) was >= 10% (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_3108 The findings of this study indicate that there is a close relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts across a variety of myelodysplastic neoplasms and clearly demonstrate that this molecular lesion is associated with a favorable clinical outcome in these disorders.
Train_Line_3109 All 13 mutations were heterozygous and 7 mutations have not been previously described.
Train_Line_3110 Data on the prognostic impact of myeloid sarcoma are limited.
Train_Line_3111 Identity between granulocyte and buccal DNA for individual patients was confirmed using eight informative synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Train_Line_3112 Furthermore, there is no benefit of LDAC in patients with adverse cytogenetics. The choice of therapy very much depends on a patient's wishes.
Train_Line_3113 5.2.3 Monitoring of minimal residual disease.
Train_Line_3114 Maintenance chemotherapy is generally not routinely administered outside of clinical trials for patients with non-APL AML.
Train_Line_3115 Hypermethylation of the ABL1, CALCA, CDH1, CDKN4A, CDKN4B, DAPK1, MGMT, NPM1, TIMP2 and TP73 genes has been reported, albeit usually in low percentages of patients.
Train_Line_3116 Once adjusting for CBF status (P < .001), among patients with mutated RAS, those in the HDAC group had a markedly lower relapse rate compared with those in the LDAC group (HR = 0.28; P = .002; Table 2 and Fig 3A).
Train_Line_3117 After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min.
Train_Line_3118 In the same period that the CMD-WG investigators were conducting whole-exome studies in myelodysplasia with ring sideroblasts, Yoshida et al performed whole-exome sequencing of paired tumor/control DNA from patients with various subtypes of MDS.
Train_Line_3119 Figure 1. Schematic representation of precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing. Top: Human genes have coding (exon) and noncoding (intron) sequences and are initially expressed as pre-mRNA that includes all of these sequences. In the process of precursor mRNA splicing or maturation, introns are excised and flanking exons are joined into the mature sequence of RNA. Bottom: Excision and ligation processes of pre-mRNA splicing are catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecular structure composed of 5 snRNAs associated with proteins to form particles termed snRNPs. Each U1, U2, and U5 snRNP contains a single snRNA and several proteins, whereas U4 and U6 snRNPs contains 2 snRNAs and several proteins. In most eukaryotes, there are 2 classes of introns: the common U2 type (representing more than 99% of human introns) and the rare U12 type; these 2 types differ in their consensus splice-site sequences (indicated in black at the 5' and 3' end of the intron). The removal of these 2 types of introns is catalyzed by 2 different spliceosomes, called U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes, respectively. The 2 spliceosomes differ in their snRNA composition, whereas most of the proteins are shared. The assembly of the spliceosome occurs anew on each pre-mRNA, which contains specific sequence elements that drive this process. The crucial signal sequences are the splice donor site (5' end of the intron), the branch site (near the 3' end), and the splice acceptor site (3' end). In the major U2-dependent spliceosome, the 5' donor site is recognized by the U1 snRNP, whereas the branch site is recognized by the U2 snRNP.
Train_Line_3120 The clinical, laboratory and survival data of the 23 patients with RARS-T are summarized in Table 1.
Train_Line_3121 In CBF AML, D816 and N822 substitutions are common activating mutations.
Train_Line_3122 Whereas somatic DDX41 mutations are ancestral in some patients, they also appear to be present as subclones in others (Figure 2E).
Train_Line_3123 A similar clinical observation was made in a recent report that showed an inferior leukemia free survival in IDH-mutated myeloid malignancies with isolated del(5q).
Train_Line_3124 As shown in Figure 5, the current WHO classification of MDS has valuable prognostic relevance, with blast percentage and multi-lineage dysplasia representing the most relevant parameters from this point of view.
Train_Line_3125 The pathogenesis that causes these pre-leukemic disorders is not quite clear yet, but immune deregulation, abnormal microenvironment and accumulation of genetic alterations may all have some roles.
Train_Line_3126 All analyses were performed with the use of SAS software, version 9.2 (www.sas.com), and the R statistical package, version 2.12 (www.r-project.org).
Train_Line_3127 Neither T670I nor V654A is an activating mutation.
Train_Line_3128 Pair-wise comparisons were performed using two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for continuous variables and by two-sided X2 tests for categorical variables, and are provided for exploratory purposes.
Train_Line_3129 Given an estimate of 1 x 106 HSCs in humans the initial JAK2V617F-positive HSC must expand 104 fold more than wild-type HSC before inducing a clinical phenotype.
Train_Line_3130 In 1990 and 2003, expert working groups published recommendations for diagnosis, standardization of response criteria and treatment outcomes, and reporting standards for clinical trials in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_3131 Now we do not know whether the LNK mutation and JAK2 V617F occur in the same clone or not, and the effect of those cooccurrence on MPN pathogenesis or phenotype.
Train_Line_3132 Mutations of other spliceosomal proteins are common in myeloid neoplasms (Maciejewski and Padgett, 2012) and were mutually exclusive with DDX41 mutations in our cohort (Figure S6A).
Train_Line_3133 This favorable impact of mutated NPM1 (with or without FLT3-ITD) on survival endpoints also seems to hold up among patients of older age.
Train_Line_3134 BaF3-E cells were transfected with either MIG or MIG-Sh2b3 using the Nucleofector system and sorted for GFP expression after 2 d.
Train_Line_3135 At least 1 mutation in any of the 18 investigated genes was found in 252 of the 354 MDS patients (71.2%).
Train_Line_3136 Colony formation was assessed after 8-9 d, by scoring the number of total colonies.
Train_Line_3137 In the entire cohort of 234 CK-AML, genomic losses (n = 1845) were more frequent than gains (n = 778) or high-level DNA amplifications (n = 153).
Train_Line_3138 Ostergaard et al have also recently detected germline mutations in GATA2 in Emberger syndrome.
Train_Line_3139 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_3140 4.4 Molecular cytogenetics.
Train_Line_3141 Thus, a potential functional link may exist between ASXL1 and JAK2 mutations but this remains to be demonstrated.
Train_Line_3142 In MPNs, for example, the proportion of ASXL1 mutations is higher in post-PV myelofibrosis (MF) and post-ET MF than in PV and ET.
Train_Line_3143 No additional mutations were discovered at this increased sensitivity.
Train_Line_3144 To estimate the prevalence of CALR mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms, we screened a cohort of 896 patients for insertion or deletion mutations in CALR exon 9 (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix), using high-resolution sizing of fluorescent dye-labeled PCR products (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_3145 Similar data have been reported by Georgiou et al in 2006.
Train_Line_3146 Amplification conditions were 95--Degree--C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95--Degree--C for 15 s, 61--Degree--C for 1 min followed by a final dissociation cycle of 95--Degree--C for 1 min, 55--Degree--C for 30 s and 95--Degree--C for 30 s.
Train_Line_3147 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3148 IPSS-R refines IPSS by more detailed classification of cytogenetics, BM blast counts and the depth of cytopenia and divides patients into five risk groups which can discriminate the risk of MDS patients more effectively than IPSS.
Train_Line_3149 Moreover, evidence of at least erythroid dysplasia on bone marrow aspirates and biopsies was required to establish the diagnosis of RARS-T.
Train_Line_3150 A recent study showed a concordance rate of 80% (Jasek et al 2010), but remarkably all our patients with CN-LOH had detectable mutations.
Train_Line_3151 Etiology of PV-associated pruritus remains to be determined and treatment responses to antihistamines have been both unpredictable and variable.
Train_Line_3152 Treatment with 2'-deoxyazacytidine restored SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression.
Train_Line_3153 There were no statistically significant differences between patients included in the present study and patients not included due to unavailability of cell samples for age, sex, FAB classification, OS, RFS, and CR rates (data not shown).
Train_Line_3154 Transient co-transfection of 293T cells and generation of retroviral supernatant were performed using Fugene (Roche, Nutley, New Jersey, United States) according to manufacturer's guidelines. 32D and Ba/F3 cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 containing 10% FBS and 10% WEHI-3B cell supernatant as a source of IL3.
Train_Line_3155 However, we identified 4 patients with concomitant SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations and 1 patient with concomitant SF3B1 and ZRSR2 mutations (Table 1 and supplemental Tables 2 and 3).
Train_Line_3156 Mutations in DNMT3A are common in AML and have been linked with anthracycline resistance and poor prognosis.
Train_Line_3157 In CMML, the presence of an ASXL1 mutation could help predict transformation to AML.
Train_Line_3158 Clinical features can help identify patients with MDS likely to benefit from HSCT.
Train_Line_3159 In addition, sequential analysis of U2AF1 mutation during the clinical follow-up was performed to evaluate the stability of this mutation in disease progression.
Train_Line_3160 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) serum levels, white blood cell count (WBC), s/t-AML, and cytogenetic MK did not impact CR achievement.
Train_Line_3161 In primary MDS, we applied similar ectopic expression experiments for haploinsufficient DDX41 expression due to del(5q).
Train_Line_3162 SUPPRESSOR OF CYTOKINE SIGNALING 1, 2, AND 3.
Train_Line_3163 IDH1/2 normally participates in the citric-acid cycle to convert isocitrate to a-KG while reducing NAD phosphate-positive (NADP+) to reduced NADP (NADPH).
Train_Line_3164 Another one patient (patient 108) with no detectable ASXL1 mutation at diagnosis by direct sequencing had in fact low level of ASXL1 mutant as shown by a more sensitive TA-cloning technique and the mutant expanded at disease progression.
Train_Line_3165 Spliceosome mutations involving SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia: Prevalence, clinical correlates, and prognostic relevance.
Train_Line_3166 These findings suggest that the spliceosome gene mutations, at least SRSF2 and U2AF1 mutations, are more likely a primary hit in MDS development rather than a secondary hit that leads to disease progression.
Train_Line_3167 In female AML patients, the mutations targeted the functional allele too, as indicated by their detection in all females studied by cDNA-based amplicon deep-sequencing.
Train_Line_3168 Over expression of the most frequent CALR deletion caused cytokine-independent growth in vitro owing to the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) by means of an unknown mechanism.
Train_Line_3169 However, most patients with a DNMT3A or TET2 mutation did not have a complex karyotype and were not more likely to have an elevated bone marrow blast percentage before transplantation, yet these patients had shorter OS compared with patients without such mutations (Fig 2C).
Train_Line_3170 The IDH2 mutations were associated with unfavorable outcome, especially in lower-risk groups including those of low and int-1 risk by IPSS, very low and low risk by IPSS-R, RA, and RARS by FAB classification, or lower-risk MDS with blasts less than 5% (other than RAEB) by WHO classification.
Train_Line_3171 In addition to mutations, DDX41 locus was deleted in 26% of MDS cases with del(5q) and resulted in haploinsufficient expression.
Train_Line_3172 Detection of FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_3173 Adjustment for presence of a complex karyotype, > 5% blasts, donor type, and conditioning regimen identified mutations in TP53, TET2, and DNMT3A as significantly associated with shorter OS.
Train_Line_3174 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_3175 GATA2 is, however, overexpressed in many cases of sporadic MDS22 and AML, particularly in FLT3-ITD positive AML, suggesting that alterations to GATA2 expression, rather than direct mutation, may occur more commonly.
Train_Line_3176 The data suggests that IDH mutations may play a role in the development of MDS in some patients, but have little role in the progression of MDS.
Train_Line_3177 Gene set enrichment analysis using gene sets from Biocarta, KEGG, genmapp, and gene ontology showed that gene sets related to metabolic processes and some related to apoptosis were enriched in DNMT3A-mutated patients, whereas no depleted gene sets in mutated compared with wild-type patients could be identified (Data Supplement Table S4).
Train_Line_3178 The exact consequences of these translocations are unclear.
Train_Line_3179 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_3180 Student t test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables and medians of distributions, such as age and hemograms.
Train_Line_3181 The median follow-up time for patients alive was calculated according to the method of Korn.
Train_Line_3182 Seven recurrent balanced translocations and inversions, and their variants, are recognized in the WHO category "AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities."
Train_Line_3183 Moreover, they provide translational opportunities for the reactivation of C/EBPalpha expression through the use of agents affecting DNA methylation and/or histone acetylation.
Train_Line_3184 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_3185 Based on the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), patients in low-risk, intermediate-1, intermediate-2 and high-risk subgroups have a median survival of 5.7, 3.5, 1.2, and 0.4 years, respectively.
Train_Line_3186 Therefore, it is likely that acquired mutations could also predict response to specific interventions, such as treatment with hypomethylating agents or survival after hematopoietic stemcell transplantation (HSCT).
Train_Line_3187 Four of the 13 mutations occurred at amino acid R882, which was also the most common mutation site in AML.
Train_Line_3188 The finding that, like in the index patient, BCOR disruptive mutations clustered in a subgroup of CN-AML patients without NPM1 mutations, and that BCOR and DNMT3A mutations coexisted in the index patient, prompted us to investigate the recurrence of DNMT3A mutations among BCOR-mutated compared with BCOR-unmutated CN-AML patients (all devoid of NPM1 mutations).
Train_Line_3189 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3190 The effect of the above compounds on an abnormal splicing factor is currently unpredictable and preclinical studies are therefore needed to explore the effect of molecule modulators of splicing factor 3b in SF3B1-mutated myeloid or lymphoid cells.
Train_Line_3191 It is stable during the clinical course and may play little role in disease progression.
Train_Line_3192 TP53 alterations were associated with resistance to chemotherapy.
Train_Line_3193 Patients with MDS were enrolled on multicenter treatment trials that investigated the use of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), antithymocyte globulin (ATG) deferasirox, lenalidomide, or thalidomide for treatment of MDS, whereas demethylating agents were not employed for this patient cohort.
Train_Line_3194 Additional fusion proteins with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity involving PDGFRbeta, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and PDGFRalpha, and more recently Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), have been described in hypereosinophilic syndromes (FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha) and in atypical MPNs.
Train_Line_3195 As expected, colony formation of BaF3-E cells was inhibited by WT SH2B3 compared with control vector transfected cells, while the RE mutation abolished the ability of SH2B3 to inhibit colony formation.
Train_Line_3196 Second, from studies evaluating the impact of these mutations in the hematopoietic system of genetically engineered mice, it appears that mutations in several of these genes affect hematopoietic self-renewal and/or differentiation without being sufficient for leukemogenesis on their own.
Train_Line_3197 MDS patients with FLT3 mutations were younger (P = 0.02) and presented as RAEB (P = 0.03) more frequently.
Train_Line_3198 ASXL1 and PHF6 mutations were associated with reduced survival, and IDH2 R140Q mutations with improved survival, among patients with intermediate-risk AML (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix), an effect similar to that in the entire cohort.
Train_Line_3199 Likewise, Sanger sequencing was used to confirm mutations where RMA was > 25%.
Train_Line_3200 Table 1. Clinical manifestation and laboratory features in MDS patients with and without SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_3201 The majority of patients with RARS-T carry a somatic mutation of SF3B1, and approximately 50% of them have a somatic mutation of JAK2 or MPL.
Train_Line_3202 We subsequently determined MK+ AML based on array data (molMK).
Train_Line_3203 Megakaryocyte colony-forming assays of bone marrow cells derived from MPLW515L- and MPLWT-expressing mice demonstrated a similar number of megakaryocyte colony-forming units, although there was a marked increase in megakaryocyte colony-forming units formed from spleen cells from MPLW515L-expressing mice compared with MPLWT (Figure 6A).
Train_Line_3204 METHODS.
Train_Line_3205 The gene TP53, located on chromosome 17p13.1, encodes p53, which coordinates transcription programs contributing to tumor suppression, and mutant p53 proteins have been identified in various cancers.
Train_Line_3206 Chromosomal translocations occur in more than 50% of human leukemias and lymphomas and are increasingly being observed in solid tumors.
Train_Line_3207 Currently, no specific therapies targeted toward DNMT3A have been developed to date.
Train_Line_3208 The maturation of hematopoietic precursors from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to differentiated cells is associated with two fundamental processes: reduction in self-renewal potential and stepwise acquisition of a specific lineage identity.
Train_Line_3209 Among the total cohort, U2AF1 mutation did not influence time-to-leukemia transformation (TTL) (Supporting Information Fig. 2A).
Train_Line_3210 Compared with CK+/MK- AMLs, CK+/MK+ AMLs were characterized by a higher degree of genomic complexity determined by cytogenetics: more than or equal to 5 aberrations, 88% (151 of 171) versus 54% (26 of 48), P < .0001; and by genomic profiling as measured by total number of losses (mean += SD; 9.29 += 7.40 vs 3.67 += 5.72; P < .0001) and aberrations per case (13.59 += 9.61 vs 6.81 += 6.11, P < .0001).
Train_Line_3211 However, for disease cure, eradication of tumour stem cells is necessary and is not achieved by current therapies.
Train_Line_3212 One of the most interesting aspects of our work is the association between the activating JAK2V617F mutation and rising platelet counts in RARS-T.
Train_Line_3213 Genotype/phenotype relationships have been defined in MDS, MDS/MPN, and related myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_3214 The comparison of the distribution of these genetic alterations between the patients with and without IDH mutation is summarized in Table III.
Train_Line_3215 This hypothesis is largely driven by the observation that homozygous JAK2 V617F mutations, which occur as a result of uniparental disomy, are common in PV and PMF, but rare in ET, the quantifiable gene-dosage is thought to contribute to the disease phenotype.
Train_Line_3216 These results provide strong evidence for the role of Setd2 downregulation in enhancing the stemness of LSCs, thereby contributing to the maintenance and progression of established leukemia.
Train_Line_3217 In contrast, patients with SF3B1 mutations, which were not associated with prognostically adverse clinical measures, were significantly under-represented in category 3 (P < .001).
Train_Line_3218 Not included in final count because p.Gly646TrpfsX12 had not been taken into account; + including CML cases.
Train_Line_3219 More recently, studies of "epigenetic" therapies in which the authors use either HDAC inhibitors or "demethylating" agents have been initated.
Train_Line_3220 We identified a total of 150 patients with de novo MDS who had paired bone marrow (tumor) and skin (normal) DNA samples available.
Train_Line_3221 The number of normal metaphases in UPN2 is 5, UPN10 is 5, UPN11 is 13,UPN19 is 1,UPN21 is 5,UPN25 is 3, UPN30 is 5 and rest of patients did not have any normal metaphases available for analysis.
Train_Line_3222 Generation of regulatable GATA2-expressing HL-60 cell lines.
Train_Line_3223 We hypothesized that integrated mutational analysis of all known molecular alterations occurring in more than 5% of patients with AML would allow us to identify novel molecular markers of outcome in AML and to identify molecularly defined subgroups of patients who would benefit from dose-intensified induction chemotherapy.
Train_Line_3224 We isolated SHP-2 immunocomplexes under basal conditions and compared their phosphatase activities to those of wild-type and N308D SHP-2 immunocomplexes, the latter representing the mutant most commonly associated with Noonan syndrome.
Train_Line_3225 We conclude that TP53 mutation status is an important factor to consider when assessing the potential risks and benefits of HSCT for MDS.
Train_Line_3226 One patient had concurrent exon 2 S34F and exon 6 Q157R mutations.
Train_Line_3227 METHODS.
Train_Line_3228 The distribution of WHO subtypes, IPSS risk groups, and cytogenetic risk groups are listed in Table 1.
Train_Line_3229 Molecular screening showed no mutations of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, or MLL-PTD.
Train_Line_3230 In acute erythroid leukemia, a periodic acidSchiff (PAS) stain may show large globules of PAS positivity.
Train_Line_3231 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_3232 In the absence of JAK2V617F, the possibility of CML is readily addressed by BCR-ABL1 mutation screening but it is also to be noted that megakaryocytes in CML (small and hypolobulated) are easily distinguished from those of ET.
Train_Line_3233 In mouse models of JAK2V617F, both retroviral transplantation assays and transgenic models, including constitutive or inducible knockin approaches, demonstrated the development of a MPN, usually a PV progressing to myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_3234 Overview of single arm alkylating therapy in PV and ET.
Train_Line_3235 Similar to the situation with Dnmt3a and Tet2 null mice, however, Idh1 R132H expression in the hematopoietic system does not appear sufficient on its own to result in AML in vivo.
Train_Line_3236 Figure 2. Multivariate Risk Classification of Patients with Intermediate-Risk AML. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival are shown for the risk stratification of patients with intermediate-risk AML (with P values for the comparison of all curves). Among patients with wild-type FLT3-ITD (Panel A), there were three categories: patients with mutant TET2, ASXL1, PHF6, or MLL-PTD, who had a poor prognosis for overall survival; those with mutant IDH1 or IDH2 and mutant NPM1, who had a good prognosis for overall survival; and those with any other genotypes, who had an intermediate prognosis for survival. Among patients who were positive for FLT3-ITD mutations (Panel B), there were also three categories of patients: those with mutant TET2, DNMT3A, or MLL-PTD or trisomy 8 without mutant CEBPA, who had a poor prognosis for overall survival; those with mutant CEBPA, who had an intermediate prognosis for survival; and those with any other genotypes, who also had an intermediate prognosis for survival.
Train_Line_3237 In addition to germline DDX41 mutation, we report here in myeloid neoplasms canonical somatic mutations in this gene, often coinciding as a second hit with the germline mutations.
Train_Line_3238 ZMYM2 encodes a zinc finger protein involved in a histone deacetylase complex (Bantscheff et al, 2011) and may constitute one of the downstream elements associated with DDX41 defects via its interaction with the LSD1-CoREST-HDAC1 co-repressor complex (Gocke and Yu, 2008).
Train_Line_3239 In addition, normalization of ABCB7 expression in RARS erythroblasts rescued aspects of the RARS phenotype.
Train_Line_3240 Favorable outcome has also been reported in single arm studies using oral busulfan.
Train_Line_3241 MPAL can either contain distinct blast populations of different lineages, or one blast population with markers of different lineages on the same cell, or a combination of both.
Train_Line_3242 CLL patients with mutations in SF3B1 had more aggressive disease and shorter overall survival than patients without these mutations.
Train_Line_3243 The outcome obviously applies to a highly selected minority of patients.
Train_Line_3244 SF3B1 mutations in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_3245 The Mann-Whitney test method was used to compare continuous variables and medians of distributions.
Train_Line_3246 P values are unadjusted, two sided, and considered significant at the .05 level.
Train_Line_3247 The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosis of CMML include; persistent peripheral blood monocytosis >1 x 10(9)/L, absence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion, absence of rearrangements of the PDGFRA or PDGFRB genes, absence of 20% myeloblasts or promonocytes in the blood and bone marrow (BM), and presence of dysplasia in one or more myeloid lineages.
Train_Line_3248 13. Supportive care.

Train_Line_3250 WT1 mutation in 470 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia: stability during disease evolution and implication of its incorporation into a survival scoring system.
Train_Line_3251 Besides, a novel mutation, P95_D97del (c.283_291del), was identified.
Train_Line_3252 So, we expected the p.Q423X mutation might result in the disruption of LNK function and have a role in MPN pathogenesis.
Train_Line_3253 In a murine bone marrow transplant assay, expression of MPLW515L, but not wild-type MPL, resulted in a fully penetrant myeloproliferative disorder characterized by marked thrombocytosis (Plt count 1.9-4.0 x 1012/L), marked splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and increased reticulin fibrosis.
Train_Line_3254 Given the low frequency of NPM1 mutations in our cohort of patients we could not evaluate an association of NPM1 and IDH mutations previously found in AML patients.
Train_Line_3255 A minimum of 20 metaphase cells analyzed from bone marrow is considered mandatory to establish the diagnosis of a normal karyotype, and recommended to define an abnormal karyotype.
Train_Line_3256 Cryopreservation to be done in accordance with the wish of the patient.
Train_Line_3257 Among the 15 BCOR truncating mutations, 8 were frameshift, 5 were nonsense, and 2 were splice site mutation.
Train_Line_3258 In their recent article, Vogelstein et al concluded that there are ~140 genes whose intragenic mutations contribute cancer.
Train_Line_3259 This result was confirmed in a multivariate analysis, including age, sex, hemoglobin level, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, cytogenetic risk, bone marrow blasts, and ring sideroblasts (HR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.11-0.99, P = .049).
Train_Line_3260 Compared with wild-type patients, DNMT3A mutated patients were older at diagnosis, had higher median WBC and platelet counts in peripheral blood at diagnosis, more often had intermediate risk cytogenetics, and more often belonged to FAB groups M4 and M5.
Train_Line_3261 CN-AML, cytogenetically normal AML; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; OS, overall survival.
Train_Line_3262 Among the 221 patients with MDS, 37 had SF3B1 mutations (16.4%), 25 had ZRSR2 mutations (11.1%), 25 had SRSF2 mutations (11.1%), and 12 patients harbored mutations affecting U2AF35 (5.4%).
Train_Line_3263 In particular, although evidence from prospective trials is not available, allogeneic HSCT should be considered in patients whose leukemic cells have FLT3-ITD.
Train_Line_3264 Ley et al found that DNMT3A mutations are associated with shorter OS, specifically in patients with FLT3-ITD.
Train_Line_3265 Primer design, PCR amplification and dideoxy sequencing of genomic DNA purified from lymphoblastoid cells of probands from seven MDS-AML pedigrees were performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).
Train_Line_3266 11.2 FLT3 inhibitors.
Train_Line_3267 For this purpose, we analyzed 262 unselected CN-AML patients from an independent Italian cohort characterized for mutations in NPM1, FLT3-ITD and DNMT3A.
Train_Line_3268 MPLW515L Is a Novel Somatic Activating Mutation in Myelofibrosis with Myeloid Metaplasia.
Train_Line_3269 In conclusion, there was no significant difference in OS in MDS or CMML patients who were FLT3 mutated versus those without FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_3270 Clinical and Genetic Features and Transplantation Outcomes.
Train_Line_3271 In concordance with these results, the BCOR mutation was detected at lower frequencies in CD34+ CD38- early hematopoietic progenitors (25% of cells compared with 90% of cells harboring RUNX1, STAG2, and ASXL1 mutations) and was absent in T and B lymphocytes.
Train_Line_3272 Many of these interactions involve ZF2, in which the p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del alterations reside, and it is likely that changes in the nature of these interactions play an important role in predisposition to MDS-AML.
Train_Line_3273 While bone marrow- derived myeloid progenitors from heterozygous wild-type/p30 mice showed only mildly increased proliferative activity compared with wild-type progenitors, p30/p30 homozygous GMPs showed high proliferative activity, high rates of frequent spontaneous immortalization, and increased self-renewal.
Train_Line_3274 The skewing of cytosine methylation may contribute to tumor development due to decreased expression of critical tumor suppressor genes that are hypermethylated in cancer cells.
Train_Line_3275 Most ASXL1-mutated patients (85%) had concurrent other gene mutations at diagnosis.
Train_Line_3276 The disordered differentiation of MDS is often associated with somatic mutations in genes that control DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, and IDH1/IDH2) or regulate chromatin modification (ASXL1 and EZH2).
Train_Line_3277 The advent of next-generation "deep" sequencing technology has enabled cost-effective, high-throughput sequencing, with the added advantage of increased sensitivity more than the conventional Sanger methodology.
Train_Line_3278 These results suggest that mutations in the RAS gene constitute a novel molecular marker potentially useful in the clinic to identify patients who would optimally benefit from consolidation with HDAC.
Train_Line_3279 To address this question, we examined samples from patients with MDS undergoing HSCT to determine whether somatic changes in frequently mutated genes are associated with long-term outcome after transplantation.
Train_Line_3280 The association between somatic and germline variants had not been elucidated.
Train_Line_3281 In all of the studies published so far, approximately 10%-20% of RARS patients have no evidence of mutations in SF3B1.
Train_Line_3282 We identified no mutation in PTPN11 among eight individuals with JMML and neurofibromatosis type 1.
Train_Line_3283 Identification of candidate somatic mutations in the AML index patient.
Train_Line_3284 When CMML (n = 35) and MDS (n = 320) patients were analyzed separately, no significant difference in OS was seen (P = .12 and P = .42, respectively).
Train_Line_3285 In none of these mutated patients, however, was the mutant allele burden significantly higher than 50%.
Train_Line_3286 This led to FDA approval for adjuvant use of imatinib for patients with high risk of recurrence (based on tumour size, location, mitotic index, bleeding or rupture).
Train_Line_3287 The variation of incidences of IDH mutations in different studies may be due to ethnic difference or bias in patient selection.
Train_Line_3288 5.2.2 Molecular genetics.
Train_Line_3289 Sequencing of 30 additional JAK2V617F-negative MF samples identified two additional MPLW515L-positive samples, for a total frequency of 4/45 (9%) patients.
Train_Line_3290 Efforts to limit the sequencing to panels of candidate target genes may improve all of these limitations, however.
Train_Line_3291 Incorporation of genetic mutations, like TP53 with a definite prognostic impact, will further refine the prognostic classification.
Train_Line_3292 ASXL1 expression was associated with neither prognosis nor clinical characteristics of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_3293 These include modifiers of mutant KIT degradation, cell death or autophagy, and of signalling pathways required for KIT-mediated transformation, for example, the PI3K pathway and PP2A.
Train_Line_3294 Mutations were found in patients of all IPSS risk groups and WHO subtypes.
Train_Line_3295 Deep sequencing for low-abundance disease clones.
Train_Line_3296 This effect was mostly found in IPSS low-risk patients, who represent the majority in our patient cohort, which implies that these mutations play a substantial role in the progression of the disease.
Train_Line_3297 Other relevant genes were assessed for frequently occurring mutations or expression levels as previously described (ie, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, MLL5).
Train_Line_3298 Among them, the disease of 171 patients fulfilled the criteria of MDS according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification.
Train_Line_3299 In high risk patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended, although not mandated in older patients without JAK2V617F or CV risk factors.
Train_Line_3300 We found that the SH2B3 PH domain mutants were weaker than WT SH2B3 at inhibiting growth and STAT5 phosphorylation of cells that harbour JAK2 V617F (HEL).
Train_Line_3301 Finally, in MDSs and CMML, ASXL1 mutations seem to be present in chronic phases and precede transformation and in rare cases, ASXL1 mutations can be lost or acquired during relapse of de novo AML.
Train_Line_3302 In addition, biological studies examining the role of TET2 in hematopoiesis through genetically engineered mouse models have been very enlightening.
Train_Line_3303 In one case, the c-CBL mutation occured after JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_3304 The aim of phase 2 (Figure 1) was to assess the real frequency of BCOR mutations in unselected patients of CN-AML.
Train_Line_3305 This suggests that the BRCC3 mutation may have been an early event.
Train_Line_3306 A strong association was found between SF3B1 mutation and disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_3307 Haplotype mapping was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of amplicons containing 50 SNPs within and surrounding the position of the p.Thr354Met variant of GATA2 (Supplementary Table 10).
Train_Line_3308 Furthermore, although several molecularly targeted therapies have been shown to be active in AML, it is clear from early clinical studies that most of these novel agents will need to be used in combination with conventional cytotoxic therapy.
Train_Line_3309 Only one report addressed the stability of WT1 mutations in the literature; they found that 4 of the 28 WT1-wild patients gained WT1 mutations at relapse, but none of the 11 WT1-mutated patients lost the mutations.
Train_Line_3310 As a calibrator, we used the average delta-Ct of primary leukemic cell samples from 14 BCOR wild-typeAML patients.
Train_Line_3311 p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del also showed dominant negative activity, with transactivation by wild-type GATA2 reduced to ninefold and tenfold, respectively, in the presence of these mutants (which is only marginally above the sevenfold and ninefold transactivation, respectively, of the mutants alone).
Train_Line_3312 Increasing age is an adverse prognostic factor.
Train_Line_3313 The involvement of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in patients who are positive for a CALR mutation may also explain the effectiveness of JAK2-inhibitor therapy for primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_3314 CD34+ hematopoietic cells from 2 normal donors and primary AML samples from 19 patients, all lacking BCOR mutations, were also analyzed for comparison.
Train_Line_3315 Moreover, those had not been reported in previous literatures or listed in the dbSNP, either.
Train_Line_3316 Genetic rearrangements involving platelet-derived growth factor receptor a/b (PDGFRA/PDGFRB) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1).
Train_Line_3317 Sh2b3 PH domain mutants inhibit growth to a lesser extent than WT Sh2b3.
Train_Line_3318 In the present study, we used high-resolution SNP6 arrays in 91 patients and found that aberrations affecting the 4q24 region were identified in only 3 of 18 patients with TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_3319 Incidence and association of TP53 mutations with clinical variables.
Train_Line_3320 Genetic alterations comprise mutations in genes that activate signal transduction cascades (eg, FLT3, KIT, RAS), gene fusions or mutations resulting in enhanced or repressed transcriptional activity (eg, PML-RARA, RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, CEBPA), or altered function of genes involved in nuclear cytoplasmic shuttling (eg, NPM1, NUP98, NUP214).
Train_Line_3321 These findings, along with our previous work (Jadersten et al 2011) and observations by other groups (Kaneko et al 1995), indicate emergence of TP53 mutation at diagnosis or early in the clinical course of disease.
Train_Line_3322 Finally, similar mutations are considered to inactivate BCOR gene function when they occur in the germline of patients with OFCD syndrome.
Train_Line_3323 SH2B3 is a member of an adaptor protein family, with structural homology to SH2B2 (APS) and SH2B1 (SH2B).
Train_Line_3324 The normal 17p status and low allele burden in majority of mutant TP53 cases with normal karyotype or isolated del5q is a possible proof of earlier occurrence of mutation.
Train_Line_3325 For instance, all known lysine and arginine histone methyltransferases require the cofactor S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) for the enzymatic activity of transferring a methyl donor group.
Train_Line_3326 TABLE IV. Sequential Studies in the MDS Patients Who had IDH Mutations at Diagnosis and/or at Follow-ups.
Train_Line_3327 Methods.
Train_Line_3328 With regard to cytogenetics, mutations of this gene were associated with -Y abnormality (OR; 3.70, 95%CI; 1.25-11.0; P=0.034), while all other karyotype abnormalities showed similar distributions between WT and mutant cases (Table 2).
Train_Line_3329 MPLW515L is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention with small molecule inhibitors.
Train_Line_3330 Although not located in the pseudokinase domain, these mutations may modify the structure of the JH2 domain in a very similar fashion as V617F.
Train_Line_3331 Two patients (nos. 21 and 23) each acquired an additional WT1 mutation on a different allele.
Train_Line_3332 Patients with ASXL1 point mutations are included in the wild-type cohort in this analysis.
Train_Line_3333 The Affymetrix 450 fluidics station and the Affymetrix 3000 G7 gene scanner were used to wash, stain and scan the arrays.
Train_Line_3334 No genetic mutations were associated with longer PFS or OS.
Train_Line_3335 ASXL1 mutations have been associated with inferior survival among ELN Favorable, but not among ELN Intermediate-I patients.
Train_Line_3336 FLT3 mutations were identified in 12 (0.95%) MDS patients: 9 (75%) had FLT3-ITD mutation and 3 had FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutation.
Train_Line_3337 The Stat View (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) statistical package was used for all calculations.
Train_Line_3338 Interestingly, TF-1 cells transformed by TET2 loss were similarly inhibited by knockdown of EglN1.
Train_Line_3339 Mutations in the TET2 gene have been identified in 19%-26% of MDS and 50% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients, making it one of the most frequently mutated genes in these myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_3340 Abbreviations: CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; FAB, French-American-British classification; IPSS, international prognostic scoring system; IPSS-R, revised IPSS; MDS-U, unclassified; RA, refractory anemia; RAEB, refractory anemia with excess blasts; RAEBT, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; RARS, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; RCUD, refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia; WBC, white blood cell. There were no patients with MDS with isolated del(5q) in this study. aMedian (range).
Train_Line_3341 Similar results were obtained with another JMD mutant.
Train_Line_3342 SNP data for this patient showed a UPD at this locus with a relatively high level of background noise, in line with expectations for a mixed population (Figure 5D).
Train_Line_3343 The genes to be sequenced may include ~50 to 60 myelodysplasia driver genes, genes associated with inherited disorders that predispose to MDS, and a reasonable number of germ-line single nucleotide polymorphisms that allow reliable detection of copy number changes from sequencing data.
Train_Line_3344 To better stratify the CN-AML patients into different risk groups according to gene mutations, a scoring system was formulated based on the results of our Cox proportional hazards model.
Train_Line_3345 The mutations were confirmed by at least 2 repeated analyses in this study.
Train_Line_3346 In contrast, 2 studies did not find any significant effect of the mutation on clinical outcome; apparently, these studies did not account for right censoring of the observations at the time of any potentially disease-modifying treatment.
Train_Line_3347 Of the 330 AML patients undergoing conventional intensive induction chemotherapy, 248 (75.2%) patients achieved CR.
Train_Line_3348 The median follow-up time for patients alive was calculated according to the method of Korn.
Train_Line_3349 Interestingly, mutations in this gene seem to cluster in the methyltransferase domain (exons 16 to 23) with a mutation hotspot in codon R882, as only a few mutations were detected in exons 1 to 14 in a previous report of DNMT3A mutations8 and none in 20 patients with AML and 20 patients with MDS in our analysis.
Train_Line_3350 Nonetheless, approximately 15% of these patients did not carry any mutation in genes encoding key components of the spliceosome.
Train_Line_3351 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_3352 Dysplastic features affected predominantly granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis.
Train_Line_3353 The RCMD-RS category was created in the 2001 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms but was then incorporated into RCMD in the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_3354 CN-AML with mutations in CEBPA is another subset that has been associated with a favorable prognosis.
Train_Line_3355 Blood counts should be done every 1 to 3 months for the first 2 years, then every 3 to 6 months up to 5 years.
Train_Line_3356 In the former setting, FLT3-ITD is associated with increased blasts, inferior EFS, and OS.
Train_Line_3357 Liver-specific C/EBPalpha-knock-in mice demonstrate partial resistance to diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma formation corroborating a tumor suppressive role of C/EBPalpha in hepatic carcinogenesis.
Train_Line_3358 In addition, recent preclinical studies suggest inhibition of the EGLN family of prolyl hydroxylases may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of TET2 mutant patients (discussed in the next section, on IDH1/2 mutations).
Train_Line_3359 Among patients with primary myelofibrosis, those with a CALR mutation had a lower white-cell count (P = 0.03) and a higher platelet count (P<0.001) than patients with mutated JAK2.
Train_Line_3360 Cells expressing the type 1 CALR mutation showed growth that was independent of interleukin-3 and also showed hypersensitivity to interleukin-3 (Fig. 5A).
Train_Line_3361 RNA was prepared from 11 normal individuals, 112 MPD patients and 6 IE patients (the source of RNA being peripheral blood in 2 cases, purified granulocytes in 123 cases and purified mononuclear cells in 48 cases).
Train_Line_3362 Ebert and Bernard have proposed the provocative hypothesis that SF3B1 mutations might occur initially in multipotent hematopoietic stem cells and that additional somatic mutations may determine the disease phenotype.
Train_Line_3363 Two hundred and seventy-seven consecutive patients with MDS seen at the Mayo Clinic from 2000 to 2005 were included in the study.
Train_Line_3364 Interestingly, each splice gene was significantly associated with one particular gene involved in epigenetic regulation.
Train_Line_3365 Patients age 66 or older with CBF AML have a 75% CR rate and only a 16% death rate with cytarabine-containing therapy, making standard therapy a very plausible option.
Train_Line_3366 These markers have not only helped to better characterize patients, but also to improve risk stratification, especially in the large group of patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML).
Train_Line_3367 This patient had AML with monosomy 7.
Train_Line_3368 The only exception was the adjustment in tests of the effect of mutations on the response to the induction dose, for which a step-down Holm procedure was used to correct for multiple testing.
Train_Line_3369 Garcia-Mareno et al re-stratified the IPSS low and int-1 risk patients into three groups based on a scoring model that computed cytogenetics, age, hemoglobin levels, platelet counts and percentage of BM blasts.
Train_Line_3370 Figure 4. Survival curves of idiopathic myelofibrosis patients according to SOCS3 promoter methylation status. Sixteen patients carried a methylated SOCS3 allele and 31 patients had no SOCS3 promoter methylation.
Train_Line_3371 The puzzling ability of C/EBPalpha to direct cellular differentiation in a tissue-specific manner is thought to depend on the presence of specific collaborating transcription factors.
Train_Line_3372 Abbreviations: IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; IPSS-R, International Prognostic Scoring System-revised; MDS-U, myelodysplastic syndrome unclassifiable; RAEB, refractory anemia with excess blasts; RARS, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; RCMD, refractory anemia with multilineage dysplasia; WHO, World Health Organization.
Train_Line_3373 There are, to date, no controlled studies that implicate either hydroxyurea or busulfan as being leukemogenic in either ET or PV.
Train_Line_3374 These mutations were accompanied by a JAK2 V617F mutation.
Train_Line_3375 Interestingly, patients with mutated status (both frameshift as well as point mutations) expressed less ASXL1 than patients with unmutated status, which suggests that the mutation disrupts normal gene expression.
Train_Line_3376 The diversity of somatically mutated genes reflects a variety of pathogenic mechanisms in these disorders.
Train_Line_3377 When both the RAS status and consolidation therapy were taken into account (Fig 1A), RAS-mutated patients treated with HDAC had a lower rate of relapse than RAS-mutated patients treated with LDAC (P = .001; 10-year CIR, 45% v 100%).
Train_Line_3378 One might also consider platelet-lowering agents (e.g., hydroxyurea) in such aspirin-refractory cases, but the target platelet count in this instance should be the level at which relief of symptoms is observed, and not necessarily 400 x 109 /L.
Train_Line_3379 Usually large, but also submicroscopic, losses (down to 800 kb in size) affecting the TP53 locus on 17p13 were identified in 94 of 234 (40%) cases.
Train_Line_3380 Correlating the presence of acquired mutations in MDS with clinical features and outcome will potentially provide a strong molecular basis for future classification and prognostic scoring systems.
Train_Line_3381 The next report described five individuals with familial AML harboring a germline 217insC mutation.
Train_Line_3382 Disruption of normal differentiation is a critical component of tumorigenesis, but the genetic mechanisms of this process are still poorly understood. Cells must be capable to enter a quiescent state in a precisely regulated manner, such as during terminal differentiation to maintain tissue homeostasis, or in response to DNA damage or oncogenic stress.
Train_Line_3383 Recent developments prompted an international expert panel to provide updated evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of AML, that contain both minimal requirements for general practice as well as standards for clinical trials.
Train_Line_3384 BRCC3 is a component of the BRCA1-A and BRISC complexes.
Train_Line_3385 BCOR-mut MDS patients had an inferior OS and a higher cumulative incidence of AML transformation.
Train_Line_3386 Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the independent prognostic factors for OS.
Train_Line_3387 Germline mutations in familial leukemia syndromes and somatic mutations of the same gene in sporadic cases are a hallmark of key drivers in leukemogenesis such as CEBPA.
Train_Line_3388 Neither the IPSS nor the LR-PSS includes the mutation status of any genes.
Train_Line_3389 RUNX1 MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_3390 Ref/Obs, reference/observed; SNV, single-nucleotide variant.
Train_Line_3391 These findings are consistent with the presence of a dominant clone with heterozygous SF3B1 mutation in most of the cases, and with the existence of a minority mutant clone in a small fraction of patients.
Train_Line_3392 TP53-mutant samples had a paucity of mutations in other genes (mean, 1.1 non-TP53 mutations per complex sample v 2.5 per noncomplex sample; P < .001).
Train_Line_3393 Megakaryocyte colony-forming assays were performed in collagen-containing medium (MegaCult-C; StemCell Technologies) containing TPO, IL-11, IL-3, and IL-6 for seven
Train_Line_3394 The objectives of our study were: (1) to study a large cohort of CK-AMLs (n = 234) for TP53 mutations; (2) to analyze these cases for DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) using array-based techniques; and (3) to correlate TP53 alterations with specific chromosome abnormalities, CNAs, MK, and clinical outcome.
Train_Line_3395 Patients with wild-type RAS also benefited from HDAC, but to a lesser extent (P = .038; 10-year CIR, 68% v 80%).
Train_Line_3396 Ring sideroblasts are also the morphologic hallmark of congenital sideroblastic anemias, inherited disorders because of germline mutations of genes such ALAS2 (X-linked sideroblastic anemia, OMIM #300751), ABCB7 (sideroblastic anemia and spinocerebellar ataxia, OMIM #301310), and SLC25A38 (autosomal recessive pyridoxine-refractory sideroblastic anemia, OMIM #205950).
Train_Line_3397 We have recently shown that expression of a homodimeric type I cytokine receptor, such as the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL), or the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSFR), is required for JAK2V617F-mediated transformation of hematopoietic cells and for activation of downstream signaling.
Train_Line_3398 Of these, UPCs 1932 and 2306 had deletions spanning the TET2 locus at 4q24, and UPC 2719 had UPD on 4q21.21-q35.2.
Train_Line_3399 BCOR expression levels were significantly lower in BCOR-mut patients (P < .001; median, 0.012; range, 0.008-0.017) compared with BCOR-wt patients (median, 0.078; range, 0.071-0.11; Figure 3) and non-MDS controls (P < .001; median, 0.095; range, 0.082-0.120).
Train_Line_3400 In patients with CNS involvement, 40 to 50 mg of cytarabine should be administered intrathecally, 2 to 3 times per week until clearance of blasts, followed by 3 further injections with the same dosage.
Train_Line_3401 Figure 4. Allelic ratio between the mutant and the wild-type JAK2 allele (%T) in RARS-T. At last follow-up 6/11 RARS-T patients had an allelic ratio >50%T (mean 59%).
Train_Line_3402 A panel of monoclonal antibodies to myeloid-associated antigens, including CD13, CD33, CD11b, CD15, CD14, and CD41a, lymphoid-associated antigens, including CD2, CD5, CD7, CD19, CD10, and CD20, and lineage-nonspecific antigens HLA-DR, CD34, and CD56 was used to characterize the phenotypes of the leukemia cells, as previously described.
Train_Line_3403 Sequence variants, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertion/deletion events (indels) were called by The Genome Center's mutational profiling pipeline and manually reviewed.
Train_Line_3404 Figure 1. Mutational Complexity of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). A Circos diagram (Panel A) depicts the relative frequency and pairwise co-occurrence of mutations in patients with newly diagnosed AML who were enrolled in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group E1900 clinical trial. The length of the arc corresponds to the frequency of mutations in the first gene, and the width of the ribbon corresponds to the percentage of patients who also had a mutation in the second gene. Pairwise co-occurrence of mutations is denoted only once, beginning with the first gene in the clockwise direction. Panel A also shows the frequency of mutations in the test cohort. Panels B and C show the mutational events in patients with mutant DNMT3A and mutant FLT3, respectively. Since, for clarity, only pairwise mutations are encoded, the arc length was adjusted to maintain the relative size of the arc, and the correct proportion of patients with only a single mutant allele is represented by the not otherwise-occupied space within each mutational subset (all panels). ITD denotes internal tandem duplication, PTD partial tandem duplication, and TKD tyrosine kinase domain.
Train_Line_3405 As suggested by Papaemmanuil et al, this observation may indicate that some genes may only be transforming in specific genomic contexts.
Train_Line_3406 DDX41 and Other Helicase Defects in Myeloid Neoplasms.
Train_Line_3407 When serial replating assays were used to assess the effects of DDX41 on retention of clonogenic capacity (Sontakke et al, 2014; He et al, 2011), knockdown cells showed significantly increased replating efficiency consistent with retained clonogenic properties (Figure 4C).
Train_Line_3408 BCOR mutations were found only in 2 of 197 (1%) NPM1-mutated patients, as opposed to 24 of 213 (11.3%) NPM1-wild-type CN-AML patients (Fisher exact test P < .001; Table 3 block A).
Train_Line_3409 The p.R551W and p.I568T are missense mutations located on exon 8 encoding the C-terminal region.
Train_Line_3410 The clonal architecture of MDS has been elegantly studied by Delhommeau et al following the identification of somatic TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_3411 Table 1. Major genetic abnormalities identified in SETD2-mutated patients with leukemia.
Train_Line_3412 The vast majority of the ASXL1 mutations found in myeloid malignancies affect the twelfth exon of the gene although rare mutations in other exons have been detected.
Train_Line_3413 Detection of mutations in other genes, including IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, MLL/PTD, RUNX1, FLT3/ITD, WT1, N-RAS, K-RAS, ASXL1, DNMT3, and EZH2 was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_3414 ATM is activated by DSB and signals the cell-cycle checkpoint to slow the passage of cells through the cycle to allow time for DNA repair.
Train_Line_3415 In the case of the type 1-mutant CALR, however, this colocalization was less prominent, probably because of the absence of the C-terminal KDEL sequence of the mutant CALR (Fig. 5D).
Train_Line_3416 In our transplantation cohort of largely higher-risk patients, SF3B1 mutations were rare, and most DNMT3A-mutant samples were SF3B1 wild type (88%).
Train_Line_3417 A screen for the JAK2V617F mutation in 200 patients from our cohort identified only one patient (MDS/MPN-unclassifiable [U]) carrying the V617F mutation with no coexistent TET2 mutation, suggesting that in MDS such mutations were not a downstream effect of a TET2 lesion.
Train_Line_3418 However, although dasatinib strongly inhibits D816 mutant KIT in cell line models, its activity on mutant relative to WT KIT still depends on the particular amino acid substitution (Y>>F>V) and varies between reports.
Train_Line_3419 JAK2 plays a central role in the signaling from "myeloid" cytokine receptors.
Train_Line_3420 This is the proposed mechanism by which SRSF2 mutations have been thought to be associated with poor outcomes in patients with myeloid neoplasms, namely MDS and PMF.
Train_Line_3421 KIT KINASE INHIBITORS AND PRIMARY RESISTANCE.
Train_Line_3422 Outcomes of clinical trials in GIST, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), systemic mastocytosis and melanoma and their implications for future directions are considered.
Train_Line_3423 In all nine patients, we were able to clone the mutant in addition to the wild-type clone (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_3424 Table 2. Univariate and multivariate analysis for OS in MDS patients.
Train_Line_3425 For patients for whom genomic DNA was not available (n = 64; 20 patients with CN-AML, 44 patients with other karyotype), we sequenced the regions panning R882 on the cDNA level.
Train_Line_3426 Mutational analysis of the validation cohort confirmed the reproducibility of our prognostic schema for predicting the outcome in patients with AML (adjusted P<0.001) (Fig. 3C).
Train_Line_3427 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_3428 Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix SNP6 platform and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix).
Train_Line_3429 Five patients with good risk IPSS cytogenetics and TP53 mutation had isolated del 5q whilst 3 cases had normal karyotype by conventional metaphase cytogenetics (MC).
Train_Line_3430 We have shown that several of the recurrent somatic mutations seen in MDS predict prognosis independent of the IPSS score.
Train_Line_3431 In CML, oligomerization of the BCR-ABL fusion protein via the BCR coiled-coil domain induces the constitutive activation of ABL that triggers many signaling pathways and drives the disease.
Train_Line_3432 Total RNA extraction from the AML samples, followed by randomly primed reverse transcription, was performed according to standard methods.
Train_Line_3433 The therapeutic potential for epigenetic-targeted therapies in AML.
Train_Line_3434 Somatic Mutations of Calreticulin in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.
Train_Line_3435 Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using gene ontology, KEGG, Biocarta, and Genmapp gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database.
Train_Line_3436 Furthermore, some of the SH2B3 nucleotide changes discovered in MPN patients are germline changes (Oh et al 2010b; Jiang et al 2012).
Train_Line_3437 Many studies have reported on the use of pipobroman as a single agent in PV.
Train_Line_3438 In summary, we have found new somatic mutations of BRCC3 and deletions of other BRCA1-A complex component in MDS and MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_3439 In ZRSR2, the only recurrent mutation identified was a frameshift in codon R448 (n = 3).
Train_Line_3440 After conventional induction therapy with 3 days of an anthracycline and 7 days of cytarabine ("3 + 7") or therapies of comparable intensity, response assessment is commonly performed between day 21 and day 28 after start of therapy.
Train_Line_3441 To detect allelic frequencies for mutations or SNPs, we applied deep next-generation multi-amplicon sequencing to targeted exons (Yoshida et al, 2011).
Train_Line_3442 To meet this objective, it is likely that co-operating oncogenes will need to be targeted together with KIT.
Train_Line_3443 Our data support the idea that the mutations in the splice genes contribute to the clinical/biologic phenotype of the MDS clone.
Train_Line_3444 Figure 4. Estimated Overall Survival and Cumulative Incidence of Thrombosis among Patients with CALR, JAK2, or MPL Mutations. Outcome estimates in patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis were stratified according to somatic mutation. Panel A shows the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival among patients with primary myelofibrosis. Subgroups were compared with the use of the log-rank test. Patients with myelofibrosis and a somatic mutation of CALR had longer overall survival than those with the JAK2 V617F mutation (median, 21.4 years [95% confidence interval {CI}, 17.1 to 22.9] vs. 11.0 years [95% CI, 7.8 to 14.4]; P<0.001) or the MPL mutation (median, 8.2 years [95% CI, 2.0 to not reached]; P<0.001]. No significant difference in survival was observed between the JAK2 V617F and MPL subgroups. Panel B shows the Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival among patients with essential thrombocythemia. Subgroups were compared with the use of the log-rank test. The median value for overall survival was not reached in any subgroup. Patients with a CALR mutation had longer overall survival than those with the JAK2 V617F mutation. Overall survival at 10 years was 96.9% (95% CI, 91.7 to 98.8) in the former group, as compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 87.1 to 93.9) in the latter group (P = 0.04). Panel C shows the cumulative incidence of thrombosis among patients with essential thrombocythemia. Death in the absence of the event of interest was considered a competing event, and subgroups were compared with the use of the Pepe-Mori test. Patients with a CALR exon 9 mutation had a lower cumulative incidence of thrombosis than those with the JAK2 V617F mutation: the cumulative incidence at 10 years was 11.0% (95% CI, 6.3 to 17.1) in the former group versus 21.0% (95% CI, 16.6 to 25.7) in the latter group (P = 0.003).
Train_Line_3445 This includes frequent mutations in the genes DNMT3A (DNA nucleotide methyltransferase 3A), TET2 (ten-eleven translocation 2), IDH1/2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2), and ASXL1 (the addition of sex combs like 1) in AML patients (mutations and translocations in MLL1 will be discussed in another accompanying review in this series) (Table 1).
Train_Line_3446 CBL-c is the member of the family devoid of the C terminal domains. c-CBL is located at 11q.23.3 and is mutated in a variety of myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_3447 Indeed, several studies have shown that both t(8;21) and inv(16) sensitize AML blasts to high-dose cytarabine given as consolidation therapy.
Train_Line_3448 Double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing two GATA binding sites (Human TCRsigma enhancer) or a single GATA binding site (GATA Consensus and Human GM-CSF-153 promoter) were synthesized (Supplementary Table 13).
Train_Line_3449 Clone-amplification studies have shown that TET2 mutations and JAK2V617F act synergistically to induce a clonal dominance at the level of hematopoietic progenitors in PV patients (Figure 3).
Train_Line_3450 In Noonan's syndrome, PTPN11 carries constitutional mutations preferentially localized in exon 3, the coding sequence for the domain of N-SH2 implicated in the inhibition of the PTPase catalytic site.
Train_Line_3451 Finally, our findings may have clinical implications.
Train_Line_3452 In this study, only patients with mutations in DNMT3A, NPM1, or fusions in MLL1 appeared to benefit from this therapy indicating at least 1 therapeutic implication for the treatment of DNMT3A-mutant AML patients.
Train_Line_3453 ASXL1 mutations are most frequent in CMML (~ 45%).
Train_Line_3454 The development of secondary and tertiary resistance mutations in GIST has required development of new second-line drugs, but currently there remains a lack of good inhibitors for some mutant forms of KIT.
Train_Line_3455 Analysis was done on GFP positive cells with the LSRII flow cytometer and the FlowJo software.
Train_Line_3456 A limited backward-selection procedure was used to exclude redundant or unnecessary variables.
Train_Line_3457 We detected no sequence variations in the GATA2 coding region of 268 samples from individuals with sporadic AML except a single c.182C>T (p.Ala61Val) variant in exon 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2c), which was assessed as benign using PolyPhen-2 (see URLs).
Train_Line_3458 However, the molecular crosstalk between these mutations is difficult to predict because loss of Tet2 has been demonstrated to endow cells with a growth advantage, whereas overexpression of mutated SRSF2 or U2AF35 has antiproliferative effects and will need to be investigated in appropriate settings.

The Kaplan-Meier probability estimates of overall survival (OS, A-C) and time-to-leukemic transformation (TTL, D-H) for MDS patients factored by U2AF1 mutation status: the OS in the whole cohort (A) and in the patients younger and older than 50 years (B and C); the TTL in the lower-risk IPSS subgroup (D), lower-risk WHO subgroup (E), and lower-risk FAB subgroup (F), and in the patients younger and older than 50 years (G and H).
Train_Line_3460 Comparison of phenotypes and karyotypes did not identify differences between individuals with JMML who did or did not have mutations in PTPN11.
Train_Line_3461 Mononuclear cells obtained from BM aspirates were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved on the same day of sample collection.
Train_Line_3462 Clinical Aspects of DDX41 Mutations.
Train_Line_3463 Rare mutated driver genes may play a role in some patients, whereas other patients might not have a clonal disease at all.
Train_Line_3464 Sequential studies during clinical courses were performed in 421 samples from 142 patients.
Train_Line_3465 Thol et al identified one MDS patient retained the same IDH1 mutation when his disease progressed to AML.
Train_Line_3466 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3467 The whole-exome capture and sequencing approach produced in total approximately 86 million mapped reads (approximately 43.9 million from the tumor DNA and approximately 41.7 million from the normal DNA) of 108 nucleotides (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_3468 Growth of HMC-1 cells could be blocked by the synergistic action of dasatinib, which inhibits both SFK and D816V KIT, and bosutinib which inhibits SFK but not KIT.
Train_Line_3469 For the above expectations to be realized, functional studies of the mutant genes and prospective clinical trials that include the molecular characterization of the patient's genome are now needed.
Train_Line_3470 Analysis of TET expression in different subtypes of myeloid neoplasms did not identify any significant differences (P > .4; Figure 4B).
Train_Line_3471 In the British Medical Research Council (MRC) AML11 study, 4 postremission courses of moderate intensity were compared with 1 course, with equivalent survival in the 2 arms.

Train_Line_3474 Comparison between survival curves was carried out by the Wilcoxon test.

Train_Line_3476 Note: Supplementary information is available on the Nature Genetics website.
Train_Line_3477 DNMT3A and TET2 mutations identified in pretransplantation samples were largely from patients without adverse clinical features known to predict poor outcome.
Train_Line_3478 Variables significant at alpha = .20 from the univariable analyses were considered for multivariable analyses.
Train_Line_3479 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_3480 A recent report on comprehensive gene expression and mutational profiles in medulloblastoma also showed frequently lower expression levels of DDX41 and frequent mutations of another RNA helicase DDX3X, which suggests that defective helicase functions might be related to common mechanisms for tumorigenesis (Kool et al, 2014).
Train_Line_3481 Several mutations and aberrant expression of genes have been described in these patients, and patients with mutated NPM1 in the absence of FLT3-ITD have been identified as a favorable risk group.
Train_Line_3482 In the majority of classic MPN-polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primitive myelofibrosis-driver oncogenic mutations affecting Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) or MPL lead to constitutive activation of cytokine-regulated intracellular signaling pathways.
Train_Line_3483 In addition, one patient with TP53 mutation had del17p by MC analysis, but had a normal 17p by SNP array analysis.
Train_Line_3484 There was no difference in the distribution of myeloid colonies grown from MPLWT- and MPLW515L-expressing mice (Figure 6D and 6E).
Train_Line_3485 The Genome Analysis Toolkit (https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) was used to clean and locally realign reads before calling missense and insertion/deletion variants using MuTect.
Train_Line_3486 Asx has recently been identified in a new polycomb complex (PR-DUB) able to deubiquitinate histone H2A through the activity of the BAP1 protein.
Train_Line_3487 Slides were fixed and stained for six hours with acetylcholine iodide (Sigma) as per MegaCult protocol, and were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin solution (Sigma) as per manufacturer's protocol.
Train_Line_3488 To identify interactions of splice genes with other mutations, we performed Fisher exact test.
Train_Line_3489 In addition, both CBL and either SH2B3 WT or the PH domain mutants EQ and GV were expressed in 293T cells, protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with a SH2B3 antibody and Western blotted and probed with either a CBL or a 14-3-3 antibody (Fig 5C).
Train_Line_3490 Twenty-six patients had exon 2 mutations, including S34Y in 10 patients and S34F in 16.
Train_Line_3491 IPSS-R: Very low, <=1.5; Low, >1.5-3; intermediate, >3-4.5; High, >4.5-6; and Very high, >6.
Train_Line_3492 PKC412 is an effective inhibitor of D816V mutant KIT and has shown promise in treatment of SM.
Train_Line_3493 Further details of the sequencing methods are available in the Supplementary Appendix.
Train_Line_3494 Additionally, two groups have reported promising response rates with regimens containing high-dose cytarabine in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma, a tumor where up to 90% of the patients show RAS mutations.
Train_Line_3495 The JAK2 V617F mutation can be found in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_3496 It is essential to assess whether the benefit of the reduced relapse rate outweighs TRM or will be offset by a high TRM.
Train_Line_3497 The WT1 mutation has been demonstrated in AML-M6 patients, but no correlation of this gene mutation with FAB subtype was demonstrated in previous reports.
Train_Line_3498 RFS was similar in patients with CN-AML independent of DNMT3A mutations (HR = 1.23; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.88; P=.32; Fig 2B).
Train_Line_3499 Consistent with other studies, SRSF2 mutations exclusively occurred at P95 within an intervening sequence between the RNA recognition motif and arginine/serine-rich domain.
Train_Line_3500 Both American and European cooperative group studies have found that the choice of anthracycline (daunorubicin or idarubicin, or the anthracenedione mitoxantrone) is of little consequence, assuming equitoxic doses are administered.
Train_Line_3501 Several groups have used single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to identify genomic aberrations, including uniparental disomy (UPD), in MDS patients, which were undetectable by conventional metaphase cytogenetic analysis.
Train_Line_3502 These early-phase studies will hopefully yield critical information for further therapeutic studies of these agents.
Train_Line_3503 SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels were determined in 112 MPD patients (20 with PV, 48 with ET and 44 with MF), 6 patients with idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE) and 11 normal individuals.
Train_Line_3504 These results imply that the gene mutation precedes mitotic recombination and depict another means of AML blasts to dispense of the C/EBPalpha wild-type allele as has already been described for the coincidence of N- and C-terminal C/EBPalpha mutations.
Train_Line_3505 Furthermore, they have a significantly higher induction death rate, increased relapse risk, inferior event-free survival (EFS), and decreased overall survival (OS).
Train_Line_3506 New targeted therapies against JAK2 have been developed.
Train_Line_3507 Our data obtained on two different lung conditional models (adult SPC and CC10-driven excision) demonstrate significantly increased numbers of lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas that develop on excision of C/EBPalpha in the adult lung epithelium, supporting the hypothesis that C/EBPalpha is a lung tumor suppressor (unpublished data).
Train_Line_3508 In contrast, SF3B1 mutations have a lower incidence in early stages of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, are more common in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis, suggesting that they occur during clonal evolution of the disease.
Train_Line_3509 The kinetics of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11 decline has been found to correlate with risk of relapse, or to represent a prognostic factor independent of other pretreatment variables.
Train_Line_3510 5hmC is also more commonly enriched at gene exons compared with introns.
Train_Line_3511 They were also able to detect ring sideroblasts by Perls staining in Sf3b1 heterozygous-knockout mice and therefore concluded that SF3B1 haploinsufficiency leads to ring sideroblast formation.
Train_Line_3512 In this review, we describe the clinical, biological, and therapeutic implications of mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers which have been identified to be mutated in >5% of patients with AML.
Train_Line_3513 In this study, we recruited both patients with CN-AML and those with chromosomal aberrations.
Train_Line_3514 On overexpression in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, the nonmutant CALR colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum (stained with calnexin).
Train_Line_3515 Overall this data would indicate complete loss of wild type TP53 in a majority of CK cases.
Train_Line_3516 In particular, patients with a complex karyotype (very poor cytogenetic subgroup) had a very poor outcome after transplantation.
Train_Line_3517 Proteins involved in epigenetic regulation often depend on critical protein-protein interactions for function as well as on cofactors for enzymatic activity.
Train_Line_3518 These results are consistent with electromobility shift assay (EMSA)-protein blot and transactivation assays.
Train_Line_3519 While much is known about aberrant pathways affecting cell growth and apoptosis, our understanding of another critical step of neoplastic transformation, differentiation arrest, remains poor.
Train_Line_3520 A prospective comparison of allogeneic HSCT from matched related and unrelated donors using RIC with conventional consolidation therapy has been launched by the EBMT group together with several cooperative groups (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00766779).
Train_Line_3521 However, the veracity of the most frequently reported ASXL1 mutation has been recently questioned.
Train_Line_3522 Indeed, such mutations in the context of EPOR have been identified in rare familial cases of polycythemia, though these have not been reported in acquired MPD.
Train_Line_3523 Alternatively, JAK2-STAT activation occurs with less prevalence due to either other JAK2 mutations (for example, in exon 12; Pardanani et al 2007; Scott et al 2007) or activating mutations of the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL (Pardanani et al 2006; Pikman et al 2006).
Train_Line_3524 Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis.
Train_Line_3525 TET2 is mutated in a wide range of myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_3526 Individuals with lesions identified by SNP array concordant with those identified in metaphase cytogenetics or typical lesions known to be recurrent required no further analysis.
Train_Line_3527 Numerical variables are summarized by median and range; categorical variable are described with count and relative frequency (percentage) of subjects in each category.
Train_Line_3528 These findings are in agreement with the proposed major role of SRSF2 mutation in MDS development rather than in MDS progression.
Train_Line_3529 Nested primers were: SOCS3-MF1-nested, 5'GTTGTTAGGAACGCGTCGTC3', nt-1257; SOCS3-MR1-nested, 5'AACAAAACGCGACGAAAAAC3', nt-1203.
Train_Line_3530 Although cytopenias are the major clinical challenge in low-risk disease, transformation to AML can be observed in a significant number of high-risk MDS patients.
Train_Line_3531 However, chromosomal translocation alone may not be sufficient to drive full-blown disease, even in pediatric leukemias.
Train_Line_3532 Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 193 patients (43.3%).
Train_Line_3533 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_3534 We conducted a retrospective review to identify WHO MDS and CMML patients with FLT3 mutations at diagnosis.
Train_Line_3535 The role of SOCS3 methylation in patients with JAK2 V617F-positive IMF remains to be elucidated.
Train_Line_3536 These patients may benefit from earlier initiation of disease-modifying therapy.
Train_Line_3537 Because all patients with CN-AML with a matched sibling donor were scheduled for an allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in first CR in our study, we were able to evaluate the effect of DNMT3A mutation status on transplantation outcome on an intent-to-treat basis.
Train_Line_3538 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3539 Mutation analysis was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_3540 Interestingly, DNMT3A encodes for a methyltransferase enzyme catalyzing the addition of methyl groups to CpG dinucleotides.
Train_Line_3541 Recruitment and activation of SFK are of central importance in KIT signalling, but this requirement is overcome by the D816V mutation which confers a Src-like substrate specificity on KIT itself.
Train_Line_3542 TP53 was found to be the strongest predictor for OS (HR-3.78, P < 0.0001, 95%CI 2.37-6.20) and PFS (HR-3.22, P < 0.0001, 95%CI 1.97-5.26).
Train_Line_3543 In addition, 1/11 of RARS patients with platelet counts < 600x109/L was also JAK2V617F positive.
Train_Line_3544 This assumption fits with the human situation in which most patients with ET have a single JAK2V617F mutation, whereas in most PV cases, 2 copies of JAK2V617F are present because of uniparental disomy.
Train_Line_3545 First-trimester spontaneous miscarriage rate in ET or PV (>30%) is significantly higher than the 15% rate expected in the control population and does not appear to be influenced by specific treatment.
Train_Line_3546 SOCS proteins may also target JAK2 for proteosome-mediated degradation.
Train_Line_3547 In the 36 patients with U2AF1 mutation, 21 had concurrently other mutations among which ASXL1 mutation was the most common mutation (N = 10, 28.6%), followed by RUNX1 mutation (N = 5, 16.7%) and DNMT3A mutation (N = 3, 8.3%) (Table II).
Train_Line_3548 Table 2. List of somatic mutations identified in the MDS index patient (UPN11).
Train_Line_3549 Direct sequencing for IDH1 exon 4 mutations was done using the following primer sequences: sense, 5'-CGGTCTTCAGAGAAGCCATT-3' and anti-sense, 5'-CACATTATTGCCAACATGAC-3'.
Train_Line_3550 High resolution melt analysis did not detect p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del or other variants in exon 5 of GATA2 in 695 nonl eukemic ethnically matched normal controls (comprising 1,390 chromosomes) (Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_3551 We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients.
Train_Line_3552 Fifty-two (19%) patients were red cell transfusion-dependent at diagnosis, and none of the patients had clinical or laboratory evidence for transfusional hemosiderosis.
Train_Line_3553 Their short median survival of 4.6 months is striking and suggests no HSCT benefit in this group.
Train_Line_3554 During the clinical follow-ups, eight of the 15 U2AF1-mutated patients showed disease progression to higher risk subtypes, including three with AML transformation, while 66 of the 127 U2AF1-wild patients showed disease progression, including 50 with AML transformation.
Train_Line_3555 To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the phosphorylation of STAT5 in the presence and absence of interleukin-3 in the control and CALR-transfected cell lines.
Train_Line_3556 At a median follow-up of 15 months, 176 (78%) deaths and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented.
Train_Line_3557 All frame-shift mutations (fs) are, by their nature, Indel mutations and are described by the number of amino acids corresponding to the length of the new frame after the Indel event, which is indicated at the end of the mutation description.
Train_Line_3558 More recently kinetic studies demonstrated that kinase domain activation is strikingly enhanced in D816H mutant KIT compared to WT.
Train_Line_3559 A scoring system incorporating WT1 mutation, NPM1/FLT3-ITD, CEBPA mutations, and age into survival analysis proved to be very useful to stratify CN-AML patients into different prognostic groups (P < .001).
Train_Line_3560 These substitutions have also been reported in GIST.
Train_Line_3561 Accurate information with regards to the different treatment strategies used in these patients was not available.
Train_Line_3562 We analyzed the effect of allogeneic transplantation on OS of patients with DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_3563 All analyses accounted for left censoring of the observations at the time of mutation assessment.
Train_Line_3564 However, in our study, we did not see significant difference in OS in FLT3-mutated MDS and CMML patients when compared with those without FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_3565 Mutations occur in ~30% of adult and pediatric AML cases and are particularly common among cytogenetically normal (44%: 32% with FLT3-ITD and 12% with FLT3-TKD) or t(15;17) AML (40%).
Train_Line_3566 Shih et al reviewed 70 patients with MDS that progressed to AML.
Train_Line_3567 FLT3-ITD-mutated patients also had a significantly shorter survival than nonmutated patients (5.6 += 1.3 vs. 18.0 += 1.7 months, P = 0.0008).
Train_Line_3568 A higher frequency of FLT3 mutations in CMML compared to MDS has been previously reported.
Train_Line_3569 All incubations were performed at 20 --Degree--C.
Train_Line_3570 Unlike mutations in TET2 and DNMT3A, which are associated with adverse outcome in CN-AML, the prognostic relevance of mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 has yielded disparate results among studies despite being examined in multiple large cohorts of AML patients (reviewed recently by Abdel-Wahab).
Train_Line_3571 There was a strong correlation between SF3B1 mutations and increased BM RS% (P < 0.0001).
Train_Line_3572 There was no significant difference in outcome between the 185 patients included in the current analysis and those who were not included because of lack of available tissue (P > .68).
Train_Line_3573 When expressed at equivalent levels under nondifferentiating conditions, unlike wild-type and p.Leu359Val, which inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del acted as loss-of-function mutants (Fig. 4b,f,j).
Train_Line_3574 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_3575 No significant difference was seen within peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Train_Line_3576 In addition, LNK negatively regulates c-KIT and FMS signaling.
Train_Line_3577 PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS.
Train_Line_3578 Although it is clearly an activating mutation, in the primary context N822K remains similar in imatinib sensitivity to WT KIT.
Train_Line_3579 The sequences were compared with the reference sequence available from Ensembl (transcripts ZRSR2 ENST00000307771, U2AF1 ENST00000291552, and SRSF2 ENST00000392485).
Train_Line_3580 Interestingly, using a cell-permeable form of the R-enantiomer and S-enantiomer of 2-HG (R-2HG and S-2HG, respectively), Losman et al have found that 2-HG is responsible for the growth-transforming effects of 2-HG while S-2HG is not transforming.
Train_Line_3581 Affymetrix SNP6 analysis.
Train_Line_3582 Fig 2. Overall survival (OS) by TP53 and DNMT3A mutation status. OS of patients (A) with and without complex karyotype and (B) with complex karyotype stratified by TP53 mutation status and compared with survival of patients with noncomplex karyotype; (C) OS and mutation distribution showing overlap between patients with TP53, TET2, and DNMT3A mutations. Each column indicates individual patient; colored bars represent mutations of genes in that row.
Train_Line_3583 A standard curve was created by plotting --Delta--Ct (Ct(UMSP) -- Ct(MSP)) against percentage methylation for this series.
Train_Line_3584 SETBP1 has a direct role in the transcriptional regulation of other genes, and SETBP1 mutations are more often genetic events associated with disease progression in MDS.
Train_Line_3585 SRSF2 and ZRSR2 mutations were more common in TET2-mut patients.
Train_Line_3586 Age at time of relapse: 35 years or less (0 points); 36 to 45 years (1 point); more than 45 years (2 points).
Train_Line_3587 Spleens from MPLW515L mice revealed complete effacement of normal splenic architecture (Figure 4E), with a prominent expansion of red pulp composed of an admixture of maturing myeloid and erythroid elements, and numerous abnormal megakaryocytes.
Train_Line_3588 However, C/EBPalpha-null mice are highly susceptible to dimethylbezanthrcene-induced skin tumor development.
Train_Line_3589 Prognosis can also be effectively determined in those with low- or intermediate-1 IPSS risk by using the LR-PSS plus the addition of testing for EZH2 mutations, thereby identifying 29% of patients with lower-risk MDS who might benefit from more aggressive therapy.
Train_Line_3590 None of the 30 samples was mutated for YY2, and only 1 of 16 AML patients carried a SSRP1 mutation.
Train_Line_3591 Table 2. Comparison of concurrent alterations of other genes between MDS patients with and without the SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_3592 However, this prognostic value was lost in multivariable analysis including World Health Organization (WHO) morphologic category.
Train_Line_3593 Ring sideroblasts represent one of the morphologic hallmarks of RARS-T, and in the current study most of these patients indeed carried a somatic mutation of SF3B1.
Train_Line_3594 By conventional cytogenetics, 171 of 219 (78%) CK-AMLs fulfilled the MK criteria (CK+/MK+ AML) as previously defined.
Train_Line_3595 All amplicons were generated from cDNA or genomic DNA specimens.
Train_Line_3596 A small study examined imatinib responses in three CBF AML cases with KIT mutations; two patients with D816 mutation failed to respond while the third with an exon 8 mutation showed clinical benefit.
Train_Line_3597 Myeloid Malignancies BRCC3 mutations in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_3598 The adverse impact of TP53 persists after adjustment for cytogenetic risk and is the strongest predictor of outcome in a multivariate model.
Train_Line_3599 In addition, adverse drop out rate was significantly higher in the anagrelide arm.
Train_Line_3600 Our prognostic findings in combination with the findings by Ley et al suggest that DNMT3A sequencing in patients at time of diagnosis adds valuable information for risk stratification, but may be limited to patients with CN-AML and possibly analysis of exons 15 to 23.
Train_Line_3601 Primary analysis was performed on OS and AML transformation.
Train_Line_3602 In univariate analysis, OS of patients with ASXL1 mutations (frameshift mutations and point mutations combined) was significantly shorter compared with that of patients with wild-type ASXL1 (hazard ratio [HR], 1.74; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.82; P = .024; Fig 1A; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_3603 Together these efforts led these different groups to identify the single most commonly mutated gene in MPN, which occurs in virtually all patients with PV and 50% of patients with ET or PMF.
Train_Line_3604 Integrated mutational analysis allowed us to identify frequently co-occurring mutations and mutations that were mutually exclusive in the E1900 patient cohort (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_3605 Alternatively, mutated ASXL1 may disrupt epigenetic regulation of its target genes.
Train_Line_3606 Overall survival was calculated from the date of first referral to date of death (uncensored) or last contact (censored).
Train_Line_3607 The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are clonal disorders of hematopoiesis characterized by dysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis, and peripheral cytopenias.
Train_Line_3608 Approximately 50% of patients with germline DDX41 mutations also acquired the somatic mutation, while 0.8% patients with wild-type (WT) DDX41 acquired a somatic DDX41 mutation (p < 0.001; Figures S2D and S2E).
Train_Line_3609 Marco Tartaglia; Charlotte M Niemeyer; Alessandra Fragale; Xiaoling Song; Jochen Buechner; Andreas Jung; Karel Hahlen; Henrik Hasle; Jonathan D Licht; Bruce D Gelb.
Train_Line_3610 In these 13 patients, the percentage of mutant at relapse, compared with that at diagnosis, was increased in 4 patients (nos. 12, 16, 22, and 29), decreased in 6 patients (nos. 7, 18, 23, 25, 26, and 32), had no much change in 2 patients (nos. 3 and 21), and cannot be evaluated in one patient (no. 13) because the mutation is single base substitution (Table 5).
Train_Line_3611 The BCOR gene is located on p11.4 of chromosome X and encodes an ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, which was initially identified as a corepressor that interacts with the transcriptional repressor BCL6 through the BCOR-BCL6-binding domain (BCOR-BBD).
Train_Line_3612 Differential diagnosis of ET should include reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, prefibrotic myelofibrosis and RARS-T (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis).
Train_Line_3613 Additional investigations performed by Papaemmanuil et al demonstrated that SF3B1 mutations were less deleterious than expected by chance, implying that the mutated protein retains structural integrity with altered function.
Train_Line_3614 U2AF1-mutated patients were younger (P = 0.034) with an age-dependent trend (Fig. 1, P = 0.033).
Train_Line_3615 However, in individual cases (eg, severe infection before expected neutrophil recovery), growth factor use can be considered.
Train_Line_3616 Risk-Adapted Therapy.
Train_Line_3617 DNA from bone marrow (n = 88) and peripheral blood samples (n = 3), as well as paired constitutional DNA from 12 patients, was analyzed.
Train_Line_3618 Interestingly, DNMT3A mutations have no prognostic effect in patients with mutated NPM1.
Train_Line_3619 Figure 2 Survival data for 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes stratified by IDH2 mutational status.
Train_Line_3620 One should be cautious to use this mutation as a marker for minimal residual disease monitoring.
Train_Line_3621 The WT1 mutation was closely associated with younger age (P < .001), French-American-British M6 subtype (P=006), and t(7; 11)(p15;p15) (P=003).
Train_Line_3622 Finally, transplant recipients with a late relapse (> 1 year after allogeneic HSCT) may be offered a second transplant.
Train_Line_3623 Chromosome abnormalities are detected in approximately 55% of adult AML.
Train_Line_3624 When patients with metastatic disease were treated with imatinib (400 mg/day) striking responses were observed with increased relapse-free or progression-free survival (discussed further in Section 6.1).
Train_Line_3625 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_3626 A beneficial effect has been shown for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics in general, and for patients with CN-AML and unfavorable molecular markers, that is, those who lack the favorable genotypes of mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD or mutated CEBPA.
Train_Line_3627 The HOVON/SAKK/AMLSG recently showed that daunorubicin can be dose-intensified to 3 x 90 mg/m2 in older patients up to 65 years with more CRs and better survival, without marked additional toxicity.
Train_Line_3628 Among patients treated with HDAC, those with RAS mutations experienced relapse less frequently than patients with wild-type RAS (P = .05; 10-year CIR, 45% v 68%; Fig 1A).
Train_Line_3629 A new standardized reporting system for correlation of cytogenetic and molecular genetic data with clinical data is proposed.
Train_Line_3630 Karyotype in FLT3-mutated MDS patients was diploid in 9 (75%); 25/27 in 1 (8%), 11q in 1 (8%), and other cytogenetic aberrations in 1 patient (8%).
Train_Line_3631 In addition, two of the four MPLW515L-positive patients exhibited leukocytosis and thrombocytosis at the time of disease presentation.
Train_Line_3632 In our MDS cohort, ASXL1 frameshift mutations were independently associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
Train_Line_3633 Patients 1932 and 2719 had TET2 mutations with an RMA of 98% and 71/20% (2 clones), respectively, consistent with loss oh heterozygosity (LOH) at the TET2 locus (see above).
Train_Line_3634 Prognostic significance within CN-AML has consistently been shown for mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 genes alone or in combination in younger adult patients.
Train_Line_3635 In contrast, among patients treated with LDAC, there was no significant difference in CIR between patients with and without RAS mutations (P = .20; 10-year CIR, all patients experienced relapse within 7 years v 80%).
Train_Line_3636 Comorbidity scores, such as the HCTCI, provide useful guidance in these decisions.
Train_Line_3637 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_3638 Thol et al and Bejar et al further demonstrated ASXL1 mutation as an independent poor prognostic factor in MDS patients.
Train_Line_3639 As MDS patient outcome remains dismal, identification of novel molecular markers in MDS that allows further subclassification and possibly risk-directed therapeutic intervention remains of major interest.

Train_Line_3642 Residue V654 is directly involved in imatinib binding and replacement with the smaller A residue results in loss of this hydrophobic interaction.
Train_Line_3643 Thus, antibiotic prophylaxis should be given after chemotherapy for AML with a preference for a quinolone.
Train_Line_3644 ZRSR2 has a close structural similarity to U2AF35 and is an essential component of the splicing machinery.
Train_Line_3645 The primary end point was CIR, with time calculated from date of complete remission until relapse.
Train_Line_3646 Thus, on multiple GATA responsive elements, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del show lossof-function and also dominant negative effects.
Train_Line_3647 Mutations in splicing factor genes were largely exclusive of one another, as were mutations in tyrosine kinase signaling genes.
Train_Line_3648 When the authors compared the patients who transformed to those who did not, the former were older and more likely to have leukocytosis (known risk factor for leukemic transformation) at time of diagnosis or registration to the central database.
Train_Line_3649 Moreover, BCOR isoforms can interact with the mixed-lineage leukemia fusion partner AF9 (MLLT3) and modulate its transcriptional activity.
Train_Line_3650 Imatinib has also been evaluated in a neoadjuvant setting in which the drug is given prior to, as well as post-surgery.
Train_Line_3651 The identification of an acquired somatic mutation in the JAK2 gene, resulting in a valine to phenylalanine substitution at position 617 (JAK2V617F), has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of Bcr-Abl negative myeloproliferative diseases (MPD).
Train_Line_3652 The top ten most differentially misspliced exons (Figure 6B; top 40 gene list in Table S6) in functionally important genes were examined by RT-PCR.
Train_Line_3653 After adjustment for clinical variables associated with these end points, mutations in TP53 (HR, 2.30; P = .027), TET2 (HR, 2.40; P = .033), and DNMT3A (HR, 2.08; P = .049) were associated with decreased OS.
Train_Line_3654 Although transcription of nucleosome-free DNA into pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II and pre-mRNA splicing are traditionally considered as separate and sequential processes, increasing evidence suggests that transcription and RNA processing are strictly coupled in vivo and that several splicing factors also play a role in the regulation of transcription.
Train_Line_3655 These consisted of 67 deletions (43%) of median size 2 Mb (range, 0.3-158 mb), 54 gains (35%) of median size 3.7 Mb (range, 0.5-171 Mb), and 34 regions (22%) of UPD of median size 14 Mb (range, 6.9-104 Mb).
Train_Line_3656 The most frequent mutation, which accounts for more than 50% of all ASXL1 mutations, is a duplication of a guanine nucleotide (c.1934dupG); it leads to a frameshift (p. Gly646TrpfsX12).
Train_Line_3657 Even in younger and generally healthier patients, deciding when HSCT is appropriate can be challenging.
Train_Line_3658 Melanomas commonly express KIT and, since treatments of metastatic melanoma prior to the advent of inhibitors of mutant B-Raf had very poor response rates, early studies were conducted as to the effect of imatinib in this disease.
Train_Line_3659 Screening of patients for ASXL1 mutations might be useful for clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions in the future.
Train_Line_3660 Similarly, combination therapies of JAK2 inhibition with inhibitors of Aurora kinase, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and HSP90 have all shown to act synergistically in preclinical studies to decrease JAK2 V617F clonal proliferation.
Train_Line_3661 First, soon after the discovery of ASXL1 mutations, Fisher et al reported the phenotype of mice with a germline gene-trap allele of Asxl1.
Train_Line_3662 Via its SH2 domain, LNK binds to JAK2 and inhibits its downstream signal transduction.
Train_Line_3663 However, we found that DNMT3A mutations were not associated with adverse outcomes in the ECOG E1900 cohort (Fig. 4A) (P = 0.15).
Train_Line_3664 Simultaneous mutations of two spliceosome complex genes in the same patients have also been noted by Damm et al.
Train_Line_3665 Methodology has been described previously.
Train_Line_3666 The statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS Version 19.0 (IBM Deutschland GmbH).
Train_Line_3667 We identified this mutation in nine patients of our MDS cohort.
Train_Line_3668 Prognostic and predictive significance of driver mutations and development of molecular models for clinical decision making.
Train_Line_3669 In women with child-bearing potential.
Train_Line_3670 The median mutant allele burden in patients with complex cytogenetics, 5q- syndrome and normal cytogenetics was 60.3% (range 2.5-93%), 30.6% (range 4-54%) and 22.3% (range 7-33%) respectively.
Train_Line_3671 For further optional storage, we advise saving germline DNA (eg, from a buccal swab, skin biopsy, or sputum), a plasma sample, a methanol/acetic acid-fixed cell pellet (from cytogenetic analysis), and frozen cell pellets from various time points during and after treatment (ie, at the time of complete remission [CR], at relapse; and for MRD monitoring at defined time points during treatment and follow-up), stored under appropriate conditions.
Train_Line_3672 A commonly accepted approach is to define a treatment that is directed at achieving a new remission and that leads to HSCT.
Train_Line_3673 METHODS.
Train_Line_3674 DNMT3A mRNA expression measured by microarray was similar in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells and in CD34-selected cells from MDS samples with (n=3) or without DNMT3A mutations (n=20) (Supplemental Figure 2).
Train_Line_3675 Two main groups have been described, one comprising leukemias arising 5 to 7 years after therapy with alkylating agents or irradiation and associated with abnormalities of chromosome arms 5q and/or 7q, and a second occurring with a shorter latency, within 2 to 3 years, after therapy with agents targeting topoisomerase II that are often associated with a translocation involving bands 11q23 (MLL) or 21q22 (RUNX1).
Train_Line_3676 The clinical features of the patients bearing IDH mutations are summarized in Supporting Information Table S1.
Train_Line_3677 In univariate analysis, an inferior OS (P = .013) and a higher cumulative incidence of AML transformation (P = .005) was observed for 11 patients with truncating BCOR mutations (Figures 4A-B).
Train_Line_3678 There was no significant difference in CIR when patients who had RAS mutations were compared with those who had wild-type RAS (Table 1 and Appendix Fig A1, online only).
Train_Line_3679 Variables considered for model inclusion were IPSS risk group, transfusion dependence, age (below vs above median), and mutation status of all 16 analyzed genes (mutated vs wild-type).
Train_Line_3680 Sequential studies showed that the original ASXL1 mutation remained unchanged at disease progression in all 32 ASXL1-mutated patients but were frequently accompanied with acquisition of mutations of other genes, including RUNX1, NRAS, KRAS, SF3B1, SETBP1 and chromosomal evolution.
Train_Line_3681 Different treatment regimens did not influence prognosis in our cohort (data not shown), suggesting that treatment differences between patients were unlikely to have had a confounding effect on our analysis.
Train_Line_3682 Despite technical developments, there is still, except for APL, a paucity of large prospective trials demonstrating its clinical utility.
Train_Line_3683 At a median follow-up period of 8 years, there was no significant difference in the risk of leukemic transformation (2% vs. 1.4%), nonhematologic malignancy (2.8% vs. 5%), vascular complications (27% vs. 37%), or transformation into post-PV MF (4.8% vs. 4.1%) between the two arms.
Train_Line_3684 It should be noted, however, that somatic mutations in genes encoding other key components of the spliceosome (SRSF2, USAF35, ZRSR2, U2AF65, and SF3A1) have been recently reported in 50% of CMML patients, clearly indicating that abnormalities of splicing machinery play a major role in the pathophysiology of this myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm.
Train_Line_3685 MDS are clonal disorders of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by peripheral cytopenia and propensity to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_3686 These cells were subsequently transduced with the GATA2 (wild-type, p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val) or empty vector lentiviral supernatant and selected in 3 muM Puromycin (Sigma).
Train_Line_3687 Figure 3. Relative orientation of a sunitinib fragment (green sticks) and of imatinib (red sticks) bound to the inactive conformation of the WT KIT kinase domain. Cys673 is a residue in the hinge region, Thr670 is the "gatekeeper", and Glu640 is situated in the aC helix. Imatinib forms hydrogen bonds with Cys673, Thr670, Glu640 and Asp810 (not labelled). The figure was constructed in Discovery Studio 3.5 (accelrys.com) by superimposition of two crystal structures: PDB 1T46 (KIT in complex with imatinib) and PDB 3G0E (KIT in complex with sunitinib). The two protein structures are virtually identical, and only the 1T46 protein is shown as a gold ribbon, with selected amino acids displayed as gold sticks and labelled. For clarity, two loops are also hidden (amino acids 590-603 and 648-656). Sunitinib is not completely resolved in the 3G0E crystal structure, the solvent-exposed "tail" which would point out of the kinase towards the reader in Figure 3 is missing.
Train_Line_3688 A JAK2 mutation is found in approximately 60% of patients with ET.
Train_Line_3689 Our classification held true regardless of the type of postremission therapy (autologous or allogeneic transplantation or consolidation chemotherapy alone) (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_3690 Table 2. Details of ASXL1 Mutations in Patients With MDS.
Train_Line_3691 Nevertheless, in rare cases, a strong family history may suggest a genetic predisposition, illuminating the seemingly sporadic cases.
Train_Line_3692 Both JAK2V617F and MPL mutations also occur infrequently in other myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_3693 The lack of anti-thrombotic value from anti-platelet agents in the above-mentioned PVSG-aspirin study may have been influenced by the fact that 27% of the patients randomized to the phlebotomy-aspirin-dipyridamole arm had a prior history of thrombosis compared with 13% in the other arm.
Train_Line_3694 In patient n. 238, the JAK2V617F allelic ratio increased from 19% to 72% within 14 months, also paralleled with an increase in the platelet count (Table 1).
Train_Line_3695 To identify tumor samples that might contain a somatic deletion or copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving the DNMT3A gene, we used the Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 to analyze three samples containing two or more consecutive SNPs that appeared to be heterozygous in the germline (skin) and homozygous in the paired tumor sample.
Train_Line_3696 The clinical course in these patients was more indolent than that in patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation.
Train_Line_3697 This translated into significantly worse OS for TP53-altered CK-AML (P = .04; supplemental Figure 3).
Train_Line_3698 Mutations in RAS were detected in leukemia cells from 34 patients (18%), with the remaining 151 patients (82%) having wild-type RAS alleles.
Train_Line_3699 These findings validate the LR-PSS in an independent cohort of patients.
Train_Line_3700 NPM1 mutations likely provide one of the most promising new targets and studies are ongoing to evaluate the clinical utility of MRD monitoring in AML with NPM1 mutation.
Train_Line_3701 Besides being older and having lower BM blasts, TP53-altered CK-AML had no distinct clinical phenotype, possibly because of the complexity of concurrent genetic events and different consequences of TP53 alterations.
Train_Line_3702 Because CBF status was predictive of a lower CIR in addition to postremission cytarabine dose (Table 2 and Fig 2A), we also performed an analysis restricted to patients with non-CBF AML (ie, those who did not harbor t(8;21)/RUNX1-RUNX1T1 or inv(16)/t(16;16)/CBFB-MYH11).
Train_Line_3703 In contrast, exon 11 mutants probably act, in general, by releasing the kinase domain from auto-inhibition by the JMD.
Train_Line_3704 Studies in patients with ET who harbor JAK2 mutations has shown increased erythroid involvement, and may have higher risk for thrombosis.
Train_Line_3705 Information on genes and their encoded proteins is from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene.
Train_Line_3706 The proportion of blast cells progressively increases over time, and overt AML eventually develops (Figure 2, step 4).
Train_Line_3707 Furthermore, 2 additional patients (UPCs 1190 and 2719) had multiple mutations where the higher abundance mutation was present at a frequency > 1.9-fold the lower abundance mutation, suggesting distinct mutation events in the evolution of the disease.
Train_Line_3708 In our cohort of 149 cases analyzed by WES, 2 patients (1.3%) with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-1 (CMML-1) revealed 2 somatic recurrent BRCC3 mutations (c.C19T, p.Q7X).
Train_Line_3709 Several studies have shown that lack of early blast clearance or nonresponse to the first induction cycle are major predictors for poor outcome, and conventional chemotherapy offers almost no chance of cure for these patients.
Train_Line_3710 Figure 4. Functional analysis of Setd2 in pre-leukemic cells. (a) Knockdown of Setd2 in HSPCs derived from Mll-Af9 knock-in mice. The bar plot shows the relative Setd2 expression (mean += s.d.; n = 2 per group; Student's t test) in Mll-Af9 HSPCs transduced with Setd2 shRNA (shSetd2) or the scrambled control shRNA (scramble). The western blot shows the global levels of H3K36me3, H3K79me2 and H3K37me3 in these cells. (b) Serial colony-forming unit (CFU) re-plating assays for HSPCs derived from Mll-Af9, Mll-PTD and Aml1-Eto knock-in mice. Cells were treated with either Setd2 shRNA or the control scrambled shRNA. The plating round and the number of CFUs per 10,000 input cells are shown (mean += s.d.; n = 3 per group; Student's t test). (c) Serial liquid culture assays for HSPCs derived from Mll-Af9, Mll-PTD and Aml1-Eto knock-in mice. Cells were treated with either Setd2 shRNA or control scrambled shRNA. The number of passages and the log10-transformed number of cumulative cells are shown (n = 5 or 10; Student's t test for comparison between two groups). (d) Increased sensitivity to mTOR inhibition by Torin1 in Setd2 knockdown HSPCs isolated from Mll-Af9, Mll-PTD and Aml1-Eto knock-in mice. Setd2 knockdown or scrambled shRNA-transduced cells were plated (n = 5; Student's t test for comparison between two groups). The mTOR inhibitor Torin1 was added at the indicated concentrations.
Train_Line_3711 These results suggest the interactive effects of SRSF2 mutation and age on the patients' OS.
Train_Line_3712 Thus, 11 of 55 (20%) of TET2 mutant cases were associated with LOH at the TET2 locus.
Train_Line_3713 From the studies of these genes in different AML cohorts, several common themes have already emerged.
Train_Line_3714 This frameshift results in the replacement of the C-terminal negatively charged amino acids of calreticulin by a positively charged polypeptide rich in arginine and methionine.
Train_Line_3715 The relatively high incidence of mutations in SRSF2 in the IPSS low and intermediate-1 group (n = 14) allowed us to perform a subgroup analysis in patients with low and intermediate-1 IPSS.
Train_Line_3716 By contrast, neither mutations in MPL nor methylation of SOCS3 (this study) have been detected in PV suggesting that homozygosity for JAK2 V617F may be sufficient for the development of PV.
Train_Line_3717 Colony formation assays were performed after another 24 h using 2x104 cells on IMDM methylcellulose medium supplemented with 15% horse serum, mouse SCF (100 ng/mL), IL-6 (6 ng/mL), IL-3 (3 ng/mL) and puromycin (2 mg/mL).
Train_Line_3718 Among the 22 patients with IDH mutations, 19 (86.4%) had at least one additional mutation (Supporting Information Table S1) When mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 were analyzed separately, only IDH2 mutations, but not IDH1 mutations, were significantly associated with these three other mutations (ASXL1 mutation, P = 0.029; DNMT3A mutation, P < 0.001; SRSF2 mutation, P < 0.001).
Train_Line_3719 Several drugs that target the spliceosome are being investigated for potential use in various malignancies, whereas drugs targeting oncogenic Ras signaling might be useful in many myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_3720 These include mutation analyses of the WT1, RUNX1, TET2, and IDH1 genes, and the analyses of gene expression signatures, or of deregulated expression of single genes, such as EVI1, ERG, MN1, and BAALC genes.
Train_Line_3721 Such an aggressive treatment strategy might, at least partially, alleviate the poor survival impact of this mutation and could thus explain why, despite a higher risk of leukemic transformation, the impact on OS was not similarly significant in this subgroup of patients.
Train_Line_3722 Hypermethylation of the SOCS3 promoter was identified by methylation-specific PCR in 5/33 patients with MF but not in any of the 15 PV or 23 ET patients or 34 normal samples assessed (Figure 2B, Table 1).
Train_Line_3723 This finding is in agreement with the concept that the development of MDS may require concerted interactions among different genetic alterations in the hematopoietic progenitor compartment.
Train_Line_3724 Figure 2. Distribution of molecular aberrations in 154 MDS patients with at least 1 identified mutation in the 16 investigated genes.
Train_Line_3725 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_3726 There is growing evidence that these 2 gene mutations represent primary genetic lesions (so-called class II mutations) that impair hematopoietic differentiation.
Train_Line_3727 Sequential analysis of IDH mutations was performed on 454 samples from 151 patients, including 51 patients with leukemic transformation.
Train_Line_3728 Among the JAK2 V617F-negative patients, MPL mutation status did not appear to affect expression level.
Train_Line_3729 We then searched for a possible association of BCOR-mutated AML with FLT3-ITD in the unselected Italian cohort of 111 NPM1-unmutated CN-AML patients evaluated for BCOR, in which the FLT3-ITD status was available for 106 patients.
Train_Line_3730 Validation of WES findings in the AML index patient was performed in an independent cohort of 200 adult AML patients (160 CN-AML and 40 AML patients with recurrent translocations) who were sent to the MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory for diagnostic assessment between October 2005 and August 2010.
Train_Line_3731 This finding was independent of the clinical covariates of age, white-cell count, and status with respect to transplantation, treatment-related death, and response to chemotherapy (adjusted P = 0.008 and P = 0.34 for patients with mutant and wild-type genes, respectively), suggesting that high-dose anthracycline chemotherapy provides a benefit in genetically defined subgroups of patients with AML.
Train_Line_3732 These results show a negative prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutations in MDS.
Train_Line_3733 K562 cell line was transfected with lentiviruses carrying control shRNA, or DDX41-targeting shRNA.
Train_Line_3734 In hematopoietic cells, nuclear JAK2 phosphorylates histone H3Y41, thereby blocking recruitment of the repressor heterochromatin protein 1alpha and allowing increased expression of several genes, including the LMO2 oncogene.
Train_Line_3735 Despite these critical observations, many questions remain regarding the role of CALR mutations in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms and in the relevance of CALR mutations to therapeutic response.
Train_Line_3736 The U2AF1 mutation did not show influence on OS in one study, whereas it was associated with shorter survival in another study.
Train_Line_3737 With or without ring sideroblasts. Good, normal karyotype, isolated -Y, del(5q) or del(20q); poor, complex (>= 3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 anomalies; and intermediate, other abnormalities.
Train_Line_3738 Only one patient acquired an IDH1R132C mutation during AML transformation (patient number 23, Table IV).
Train_Line_3739 Seven patients had had samples taken while they had MDS and also after their disease had progressed to AML (Figure 1).
Train_Line_3740 Consistent with published data, we observed a global decrease of H3K36me3 in CD56+CD64+ leukemia cells of the twin with MLL-rearranged leukemia but not in the CD56-CD64-nonleukemic cells from the same patient (Fig. 3b).
Train_Line_3741 SOCS1 expression can be induced by a number of cytokines including many interleukins, erythropoietin and GMCSF but not thrombopoietin.
Train_Line_3742 A total of 78 patients with essential thrombocythemia (25%) and 72 with primary myelofibrosis (35%) had mutations in CALR.
Train_Line_3743 Fig 1. (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 288 patients with low and intermediate-1 International Prognostic Scoring System risk. (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the same patients assigned to categories 1 to 3 by the MD Anderson Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System. Overall survival was calculated from the time of sample collection to the time of death from any cause.
Train_Line_3744 Because RAS mutations seem to be the first example of activating oncogene mutations that sensitize AML blasts to higher doses of cell-cycle phase-specific chemotherapeutic agent, further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon.
Train_Line_3745 When so indicated, P values were adjusted to control the family-wise error rate with the use of the complete null distribution approximated by resampling obtained through the PROC MULTTEST program in SAS or the multtest library in R.
Train_Line_3746 SRSF2 mutations are found mainly in patients with multilineage dysplasia and/or excess blasts and, at variance with SF3B1 mutations, predict for high risk of leukemic evolution and poor survival.
Train_Line_3747 For the generation of lentiviral expression constructs, the regulatable pF 5xUAS W SV40 Puro (5xUAS)33 was used.
Train_Line_3748 TP53 mutations were found in 22% of IPSS intermediate-2/high-risk but only in 1.2% of IPSS low-risk/intermediate-1 patients (P < .001).
Train_Line_3749 Table 2. MDS cytogenetic scoring system: prognostic relevance of cytogenetic abnormalities in 7012 patients included in the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS (IWG-PM) database.
Train_Line_3750 Bone marrow cells were harvested from donor mice, treated with red blood cell lysis buffer and cultured for 24 hours in transplantation medium (RPMI + 10% FBS + 6 ng/mL IL-3, 10 ng/mL IL-6, and 10 ng/mL stem-cell factor (SCF)).
Train_Line_3751 However, the reports concerning the stability of IDH mutations in the evolution of MDS are scarce in literature.
Train_Line_3752 The DNA and cDNA sequencing data revealed that the mutant DNMT3A allele was present and expressed in nearly all cells in the MDS samples, even though the myeloblast count was far less than <30% for most samples.
Train_Line_3753 RESULTS.
Train_Line_3754 The patients with ASXL1 mutation were predominantly male, older (median, 71 years vs 64 years, P = 0.001) and had higher white blood cell counts (P<0.001) and higher IPSS-R score (P = 0.002) at diagnosis.
Train_Line_3755 Conditional deletion of Dnmt3a-/- or Dnmt3b-/- individually in murine Kit+/Lineage-/Sca+ (KLS) bone marrow cells did not affect myeloid colony formation, multilineage differentiation, or self-renewal, but did alter methylation patterns in differentiating hematopoietic cells.
Train_Line_3756 Four studies showed that failure to convert to a normal karyotype at the time of CR predicts inferior outcome.
Train_Line_3757 Although the effects of IDH1/2 mutations on HSCs and progenitors remain unknown, these mutations may belong to a set of initiating events of the same nature as the TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_3758 In none of these 6 cases, however, was there sufficient coverage that the 95% confidence interval (CI) excluded 50%.
Train_Line_3759 Genetic rearrangements involving platelet-derived growth factor receptor a/b (PDGFRA/PDGFRB) or fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1).
Train_Line_3760 Bone marrow (BM) cells were obtained 5 days post-intraperitoneal (IP) 150 lg/kg fluorouracil (5FU) treatment, and were cultured in Iscoves's modified Eagle's medium (IMDM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 lmol/l b-mercaptoethanol, 10 ng/ml mouse (m) interleukin 3 (IL3) and mIL6 and 50 ng/ml murine stem cell factor (mSCF).
Train_Line_3761 Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariable analysis.
Train_Line_3762 In this study, IDH2 mutations were closely associated with ASXL1, DNMT3A, and SRSF2 mutations, suggesting IDH2 mutations might interact with these gene alterations in the development of MDS.
Train_Line_3763 Subsequent modeling of the disease has shown that JAK2 and MPL mutations were able to drive the disease in mice.
Train_Line_3764 Activation of the JAK2-STAT pathway plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the Philadelphia negative (Ph-) myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Train_Line_3765 Special attention should be given to the prevention of tumor lysis syndrome (eg, hydration, control of uric acid production using allopurinol or rasburicase, control of urine pH).
Train_Line_3766 Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice with lysis buffer (50 mmol/l Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mmol/l NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 mmol/l NaF and 10 mmol/l Na3VO4).
Train_Line_3767 Further details are available in supplemental Methods.
Train_Line_3768 This standard curve was utilized to determine percentage methylation within samples from patients. To verify that the MSP PCR products were derived from methylated DNA, nested PCR was carried out.
Train_Line_3769 Genomic DNA was extracted from 5 to 10 3 106 BM cells by using the DNAzol kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_3770 Figure 2. Survival analysis of MDS patients with DNMT3A mutations (A) the overall survival of MDS patients with DNMT3A mutations compared to MDS patients without DNMT3A mutations. (B) the event-free survival of MDS patients with or without DNMT3A mutations. (C) progression to AML in MDS patients with or without DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_3771 Mock cells were injected in the right flank, while sh-DDX41 cells were injected in the left flank.
Train_Line_3772 The acceptable sensitivity of TP53 IHC staining in predicting for TP53 mutations is encouraging, as the methodology of IHC is routine in diagnostic laboratories.
Train_Line_3773 This fact may be at least partially related to the heterogeneity of investigated cohorts and also to the importance of preferential associations between distinct gene mutations (eg, SF3B1 and DNMT3A, or U2AF35 and ASXL1).
Train_Line_3774 Shortly after the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation, multiple small molecule inhibitors were developed for therapeutic use, several of which are currently under clinical investigation.
Train_Line_3775 The amplified products were subsequently diluted in distilled water and mixed with deionized formamide and GeneScan 500 LIZ Size Standard (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_3776 BCOR protein expression was therefore consistent with down-regulation of BCOR mRNA expression (Figure 3A).
Train_Line_3777 AML-related prognostic factors includes white blood count (WBC), existence of prior MDS, previous cytotoxic therapy for another disorder (see section 9), and cytogenetic and molecular genetic changes in the leukemic cells at diagnosis.
Train_Line_3778 DNMT3A encodes for the enzyme DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 3A and belongs to the family of other methyltransferases like DNMT1 and DNMT3B.
Train_Line_3779 Amino acid 515 is located in a stretch of 5 amino acids (K/RWQFP) found inside the cytoplasm just after the transmembrane domain.
Train_Line_3780 CYTOGENETIC AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_3781 The term mRNA splicing or maturation defines the process by which introns are excised from pre-mRNA and flanking exons are ligated together.
Train_Line_3782 Accordingly, patients with TET2 mutations have lower global 5hmC content than wild type.
Train_Line_3783 Therefore, we examined SH2B3 WT and PH domain mutants binding to JAK2, 14-33 and CBL (Fig 5).
Train_Line_3784 In addition, ATRX is a member of the SWI/SNF group of proteins that associate with chromatin and ATRX is mutated in a rare form of MDS that is associated with alpha-thalassemia (ATMDS).
Train_Line_3785 In addition, in both PV and ET, some patients may develop acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS), especially in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelets >1,000 x 109 /L), and be at risk for aspirin-associated bleeding.
Train_Line_3786 Dasatinib is also a potent inhibitor of SFKs which are important mediators of KIT actions, thus this inhibitor potentially has dual targets of KIT kinase activity per se and SFK-mediated responses.
Train_Line_3787 Results of quantitative evaluation of SF3B1 mutant allele burden were consistent with the presence of a dominant clone with heterozygous SF3B1 mutation in most of the cases and with the existence of a minority mutant clone in a smaller fraction of patients.
Train_Line_3788 Conversely, inherited disorders caused by spliceosome mutations (ie, mutations of genes encoding spliceosomal proteins or mutations in spliceosomal RNA) are rare, at least based on our current understanding.
Train_Line_3789 An expression clone (pCMV6-XL6-GATA2) containing a 3.7-kb GATA2 cDNA insert was obtained from OriGene, and p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.
Train_Line_3790 The introduction of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based mapping arrays, providing both copy number and allele-specific information, led to the identification of a novel mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of AML, that is, uniparental disomy (UPD).
Train_Line_3791 The diagnoses of CMML, including subclassification into CMML-1 or CMML-2, and documentation regarding the presence or absence of RS and leukemic transformation were according to the WHO criteria.
Train_Line_3792 When we excluded patients with frameshift mutations and analyzed the impact of point mutations alone, no significant influence on OS was found (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.52 to 2.80; P = .671; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_3793 In addition, preclinical studies of several of these compounds in AML cells suggest they may result in alterations in phenotype and gene expression characteristic of restoration of hematopoietic differentiation rather than direct cytotoxicity of AML cells.
Train_Line_3794 Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include history of thrombosis, leukocytosis, and advanced age.
Train_Line_3795 Sequential analyses were performed on 133 patients.
Train_Line_3796 AML is the most common form of sporadic leukemia in adults, and MDS is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with a tendency to progress to AML.
Train_Line_3797 Results from our study and others in which both the promoter and the exon 2 regions of SOCS1 have been assessed suggest that methylation of the SOCS1 exon 2 CpG island, but not the promoter region, is a variable feature in blood cells of normal individuals.
Train_Line_3798 However, our retrospective analysis is limited by the relatively small number of patients of informative patients.
Train_Line_3799 The pathogenesis of RARS-T appears to involve, at least in part, JAK2V617F independent molecular events, which remain to be further characterized.
Train_Line_3800 Note: Any Supplementary Information and Source Data files are available in the online version of the paper.
Train_Line_3801 In these entities IDH1 mutations affect one single amino acid residue in position 132 leading to a switch from arginine to histidine (R132H).

Train_Line_3803 In some instances, a single germline mutation can induce thrombocytosis, erythrocytosis, or neutrophilia.
Train_Line_3804 The additional somatic mutations were always acquired in the remaining WT allele (Figure S2F).
Train_Line_3805 Mutations of NRAS, U2AF1, and SRSF2 were no longer significant after adjusting for the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_3806 Different patterns of missplicing associated with the above mutant genes have been described.
Train_Line_3807 In the last few years, however, there have been major advances in this field and it has become apparent that somatic mutations of genes encoding core components of the RNA splicing machinery play a major role in the pathophysiology of MDS and other hematologic malignancies.
Train_Line_3808 IDH mutations were closely associated with mutations of DNMT3A, ASXL1, and SRSF2, suggesting the interaction of IDH mutations with these gene aberrations may play a role in the development of MDS.
Train_Line_3809 According to World Heath Organization (WHO) classification, this cohort includes 132 MDS patients, 54 CMML, and 22 AML-MRC.
Train_Line_3810 Table 6. Outcome measures in AML.
Train_Line_3811 Next, we evaluated these 2 endpoints in low- and high-risk MDS patients defined by their IPSS score.
Train_Line_3812 Owing to the sometimes small size of paraffin-embedded bone marrow trephines, sufficient amounts of genomic DNA for PCR analysis could only be obtained from bone marrow trephines of 23 of a total of 57 biopsies from patients with RARS-T.
Train_Line_3813 However, increasing patient age was significantly associated with a higher incidence of TET2 mutations: 17% of patients above 50 years had a TET2 mutation, compared with 9% of patients aged less than 50 years (P = .02).
Train_Line_3814 In total, bisulphite sequencing of TP53 promoter region was performed in 17 TP53 mutant and 26 wild type patients.
Train_Line_3815 Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_3816 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital and written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from all participants.
Train_Line_3817 Prospective studies are warranted to confirm this hypothesis.
Train_Line_3818 Malformations after exposure to anthracyclines and cytarabine in the first trimester have been reported.
Train_Line_3819 Mutational frequency was 4% (2 of 56) in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, 12% (16 of 130) in refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 14% (2 of 14) in MDS-unclassifiable, 14% (6 of 42) in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-1 and 23% (8 of 35) in RAEB-2.
Train_Line_3820 CONCLUSION.
Train_Line_3821 Figure 3 Leukemia-free survival data for 277 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes stratified by IDH1 mutational status.
Train_Line_3822 The RMA was similar between CD34+ cells (median 38.5%) and total bone marrow (median 43%).
Train_Line_3823 As also previously shown (Tong et al 2005), we found that WT SH2B3 resulted in a slower and lower maximal STAT5 phosphorylation and completely abolished ERK phosphorylation after Epo stimulation.
Train_Line_3824 Second, NPM1-mutated AML is rather sensitive to differentiation-inducing agents in contrast to NPM1 wild-type AML.
Train_Line_3825 TET2 (NM.001127208) mutations and polymorphisms were analyzed from bone marrow DNA using the Roche GS FLX sequencing platform (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_3826 Additionally, DNMT3A mutations should be analyzed in treatment trials with novel drugs to identify drugs with a specific effect in patients with DNMT3A mutation.
Train_Line_3827 This gene is necessary for the cells that make platelets to grow correctly.
Train_Line_3828 The ratio of the 30 kD isoform and the residual 42 kD full-length isoform generated from the nonmutated allele is increased in the mutant cells, and functional studies have revealed that the 30 kD isoform shows significantly reduced binding to and transactivation of C/EBPalpha target promoters.
Train_Line_3829 Studies suggest that remission induction chemotherapy provides better quality of life and longer survival than supportive care only.
Train_Line_3830 Mutations in SRSF2 are independently associated with a negative prognosis for OS and AML transformation.
Train_Line_3831 Progression to AML was defined according to the 2008 WHO classification The median follow-up times for overall survival and event-free survival were calculated according to the method of Korn.
Train_Line_3832 The median PFS for patients without TP53 mutation (n = 266) was not reached (not reached, >66 months); in contrast, cases with mutation (n = 25) showed a shorter median PFS of 8.6 months (P < 0.001; Fig 3B).
Train_Line_3833 Mutation status of IDH1/2 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndrome.
Train_Line_3834 To repair DSBs, cells use both homologous recombination (HR), which uses sister-chromatid alleles as templates in late S and G2, and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) which can operate in all phases of the cell cycle but often leaves small deletions, possibly gene inactivating at the site of repair.
Train_Line_3835 Bisulphite sequencing of TP53 promoter region.
Train_Line_3836 Other parameters significantly associated with survival in the combined cohort included age, hemoglobin, and NPM1 and FLT3 mutation status.
Train_Line_3837 BCR-ABL1-positive acute leukemia immunophenotypically may present as MPAL (Table 1).
Train_Line_3838 Two patients showed conversion of CGT to CAT, one patient had conversion of CGT to TGT, and one patient had conversion of CGT to AGT leading to an Arg132Ser substitution.
Train_Line_3839 Among patients with essential thrombocythemia, those with a CALR mutation had a lower risk of thrombosis than did those with a JAK2 mutation (P = 0.003); no significant differences were found between the other subgroups.
Train_Line_3840 TET2 mutations and SNP karyotyping.
Train_Line_3841 U2AF35 mutations are seen in ~10% of patients with MDS, CMML, therapy related, and secondary AML and have not clearly been associated with an independent prognostic impact.
Train_Line_3842 Summary of randomized studies in ET.
Train_Line_3843 Figure 5. Functional Analysis of CALR Type 1 Mutation. Panel A shows the viability of cells from a murine interleukin-3-dependent pro-B cell line (Ba/F3 cells) expressing an empty vector (green fluorescent protein [GFP]), nonmutant CALR with GFP, or mutant CALR with GFP. Viability was assessed after 72 hours in the presence of an increasing concentration of interleukin-3. I bars represent standard errors. RLU denotes relative luminescence units. Panel B shows the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing an empty vector, nonmutant CALR, or mutant CALR. Proliferation was assessed after 7 days in the absence of interleukin-3. Panel C shows the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) in response to interleukin-3. Ba/F3 cells expressing the empty vector, the nonmutant CALR, or the mutant CALR were cultured for 4 hours in serum-free medium without interleukin- 3 and were then stimulated for 20 minutes with interleukin-3 at concentrations of 0.1 ng per milliliter and 1 ng per milliliter, as indicated. Western blot analysis was performed on the cell lysates with antibodies against phosphorylated STAT 5 (pSTAT5), STAT5, and CALR. An antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control. Panel D shows immunofluorescence staining of CALR (red) and calnexin, an endoplasmic reticulum- specific marker (green) in human embryonic kidney T cells transfected with the respective constructs. The nonmutant CALR colocalizes with calnexin in the endoplasmic reticulum (merge in yellow). However, the mutant CALR is not constrained within the endoplasmic reticulum. The nucleus is stained blue (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylidole [DAPI]).
Train_Line_3844 A punch biopsy of normal skin and a bone marrow aspirate were obtained with informed consent in accordance with a tissue acquisition protocol approved by the Human Research Protection Office at the Washington University School of Medicine.
Train_Line_3845 Fig 2. Epo-dependent phosphorylation of STAT5 and ERK is inhibited by the SH2B3 PH domain mutants less than WT SH2B3. BaF3-E cells transfected with either WT or mutant Sh2b3 were serum-starved for 6 h and stimulated with 10 iu/ml Epo for 15 and 60 min. Phosphorylation of STAT5 and ERK was assessed in GFP-positive cells by flow analysis, using PE-conjugated STAT5 (pY694) and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated ERK 1/2 (pY202/204) antibodies. A representative of 2 independent experiments is shown. (A) Gating of BaF3-E GFP-positive cells. (B) STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation. Mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) for each time point were normalized to un-stimulated cells and are represented as fold-change. (C) Western blot of proteins from BaF3-E transduced with Sh2b3.
Train_Line_3846 DNA sequence analysis of the exons encoding the transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains of EPOR, MPL, and GCSFR, and comparison with germline DNA derived from buccal swabs, identified a somatic activating mutation in the transmembrane domain of MPL (W515L) in 9% (4/45) of JAKV617F-negative MF.
Train_Line_3847 Genomic DNA samples were extracted from the skin and unfractionated bone marrow specimens and then subjected to whole genome amplification, as previously described.
Train_Line_3848 We found a correlation between mutations in genes belonging to the splicing machinery and other mutations (Figure 1B).
Train_Line_3849 Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier survival curves in the subgroup of patients with lower-risk MDS. (a) Lower-risk group (RA and RA with ring sideroblasts (RARS)) defined by the FAB classification; (b) lower-risk group (other than RAEB, subtypes with bone marrow (BM) blasts <5%) defined by the 2008 WHO classification; (c, d) patients with lower IPSS-R score; (e, f ) patients with favorable/intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Lower IPSS-R groups include very low, low and intermediate subgroups. Favorable cytogenetics include very good, good and intermediate-risk cytogenetic changes.
Train_Line_3850 To assess the frequency of BCOR mutations in AML with abnormal karyotype, we studied 131 AML carrying cytogenetic abnormalities.
Train_Line_3851 The result of sequential analysis of the 58 patients without SRSF2 mutation at diagnosis is not shown; none of these patients acquired SRSF2 mutation. Thirty-one of them had disease progression, including 23 patients with transformation to AML during the clinical course.
Train_Line_3852 Among many, PRPF8 and SF3B1 are exemplary spliceosomal proteins found in a complex with DDX41.
Train_Line_3853 The same was also true for the 368 patients based on the 2008 WHO classification (Fig. 2).

Train_Line_3856 In the Italian cohort (n = 262 patients; supplemental Table 12), no significant association was detected between BCOR disruptive mutations and overall survival.
Train_Line_3857 Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management.
Train_Line_3858 TP53 alterations were correlated with the presence of specific cytogenetic abnormalities, such as -5/5q- (P < .0001), concomitant -5/5q- and -7/7q- (P = .0006), and 20q- (P = .02); we found no correlation with -7/7q- (P = .14; Table 1).
Train_Line_3859 To address this issue, we used in-solution exome capture followed by massively parallel sequencing.
Train_Line_3860 The transcript levels of both SOCS1 and SOCS3 were increased in granulocytes from JAK2 V617F-positive PV patients (SOCS1: p=0.013 compared to levels in normal individuals; p=0.03 compared to levels in IE patients and SOCS3: p=0.0008 compared to levels in normal individuals) (Figure 3A, B).
Train_Line_3861 BCOR-disruptive mutations, ie nonsense mutations, out-of-frame small indels, and consensus splice-site mutations (see "Characteristics of BCOR mutations in AML") were detected in 14/82 (17.1%) in this cohort of patients.
Train_Line_3862 They found that in four of the 45 patients the DNA in the bone marrow, but not the cheek, carried a mutation in a gene for the thrombopoietin receptor (also called MPL).
Train_Line_3863 The allele-specific PCR for JAK2V617F genotyping was carried out as previously described.
Train_Line_3864 Higher IPSS-R (high, very high and intermediate) vs lower IPSS-R (very low and low).
Train_Line_3865 TP53 mutant allele burden and correlation with SNP array karyotyping.
Train_Line_3866 Point mutations of the basic region of C/EBPalpha abrogating C/EBPalpha-E2F complex formation (BRM-5: Y285A and BRM-2 I294A/R297A) interfere with differentiation in both myeloid and adipocytic differentiation.
Train_Line_3867 Most important, Klampfl et al and Nangalia et al fill a gap in our knowledge by identifying the most common mutation in patients without JAK2 or MPL mutations and allow us to better appreciate the genetic complexity of the different myeloproliferative syndromes.
Train_Line_3868 Subclone: A clone generated by the occurrence of an additional driver mutation in a cell of an already established clone.
Train_Line_3869 The prognostic impact of IDH mutations in AML has been studied extensively.
Train_Line_3870 DNMT3A mutations occurred in all FAB subtypes tested and were not associated with a specific karyotype.
Train_Line_3871 In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the transforming activity of c-CBL may be related to an increased FLT3 signaling.
Train_Line_3872 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_3873 Although confirmation of these results in larger cohorts is necessary before redefining risk-guided therapy strategies in MDS, integration of molecular analysis of the splice genes at diagnosis may improve classification of MDS patients.
Train_Line_3874 Prior studies suggested that U2AF1 mutation might be associated with ASXL1 or DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_3875 SRSF2 mutations have been detected in about one fifth of cases of AML transformed from MPN and, in particular, have been reported in ~40% to 50% of patients with CMML, where they are frequently associated with TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_3876 However, clinical variables are likely to contribute prognostic information that cannot be captured by molecular analysis alone, such as the contribution of comorbidities, disease kinetics, and marrow microenvironmental factors to mortality risk.
Train_Line_3877 Mutations in genes of the splicing machinery, such as SF3B1 (splicing factor 3B, subunit 1), SRSF2 (serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2) and U2AF35, also known as U2AF1 (U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor) are common in patients with myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_3878 IDH1 and IDH2 encode isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, which are NADP+ enzymes that catalyze the conversion of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate (alphaKG).
Train_Line_3879 The clinical effect of these abnormalities are that patients are anemic (they have low numbers of red cells), are more likely to get infections because of the abnormal white cells which cannot fight infections normally, and may bleed more easily because of a lack of the platelets that help the blood to clot.
Train_Line_3880 MPNs involve the 3 main myeloid lineages but predominate in one of them: the erythroid lineage for PV, the megakaryocyte (MK)/platelet lineage for ET, and the MK/granulocytic lineages for PMF.
Train_Line_3881 In our study, mutations of DNMT3A were not associated with a poor prognosis in contrast to findings from a smaller study in MDS.
Train_Line_3882 In this study of 226 patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), mutational frequencies were 40% for SRSF2 (all affecting P95), 6% for SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and 9% for U2AF35 (mostly S34F and Q157P/R).
Train_Line_3883 Table 2. DNMT3A Mutations in MDS Patients.
Train_Line_3884 The manner in which the ASXL1 mutation was associated with these genetic aberrations in the MDS pathogenesis needs further investigation.
Train_Line_3885 In addition, U2AF1 mutation predicted poor prognosis, especially in younger patients as well as in lower-risk subgroup of patients.
Train_Line_3886 The products were then cloned using the GeneJET PCR cloning kit (Fermentas, York, UK).
Train_Line_3887 Twenty-four patients were identified as harboring a mutation in SRSF2 (12.4%), 14 patients showed a mutation in U2AF1 (7.3%), and 6 patients were found to have a mutation in the coding region of ZRSR2 (3.1%).
Train_Line_3888 EARLY ACQUISITION OF CALR MUTATIONS AND STABLE MUTANT CLONES.
Train_Line_3889 More recently, two studies randomized ET patients to hydroxyurea or anagrelide.
Train_Line_3890 Expression of MPLW515L in murine bone marrow recapitulated many of the phenotypic characteristics of MF in humans, including atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia, splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis, and thrombocytosis that may be attenuated in humans by splenic sequestration.
Train_Line_3891 Among them, eight patients acquired mutations of other genes, including RUNX1 in four (patients 22, 51, 83 and 108; Table 3), NRAS in three (patients 26, 56 and 80), KRAS in one (patient 35), SF3B1 in one (patient 22) and SETBP1 in one (patient 108) during disease progression, whereas other six patients had chromosomal evolution (patients 5, 24, 38, 71, 98 and 100).
Train_Line_3892 Patients entering complete remission are then treated with either chemotherapy or autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT), depending on individual risk profiles.
Train_Line_3893 In the AMLCG92 trial, older patients benefited with longer remission duration from monthly myelosuppressive maintenance (cytarabine 100 mg/m2 per q12h x 10 with an anthracycline or thioguanine) compared with a single course of the S-HAM regimen (cytarabine dosage: 500 mg/m2 per q12h on days 1, 2, 8, and 9).
Train_Line_3894 The WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms also includes myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1.
Train_Line_3895 Two patients (UPN9 and UPN10, Table 3) showed concomitant truncating mutations of BCOR and BCORL1.
Train_Line_3896 Biologic and clinical significance of somatic mutations of SF3B1 in myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.
Train_Line_3897 Histopathology analysis was consistent with the presence of a MPD in MPLW515L-expressing mice, but not in MPLWTexpressing mice (Figure 4).
Train_Line_3898 The discrete variables of patients with and without IDH mutations were compared using the chi-square test.
Train_Line_3899 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_3900 The laboratory detection of JAK2V617F is highly sensitive (97% sensitivity) and virtually 100% specific for distinguishing PV from other causes of increased hematocrit; the possibility of false positive or false negative mutation test result is effectively addressed by the concomitant measurement of serum erythropoietin (Epo) level, which is expected to be subnormal in more than 85% of patients with PV.
Train_Line_3901 * Small molecule kinase inhibitors (SMIs) such as imatinib have been successfully used in treatment of GIST.
Train_Line_3902 One of the four MPLW515L-positive patients had a rapidly progressive clinical course, with death two years after initial presentation from complications related to MF.
Train_Line_3903 Recent studies provide experimental evidence that mutated RAS not only induces proliferation, apoptosis, senescence, or differentiation (depending on the cellular context in which it is expressed), but it may also induce a DNA damage checkpoint response.
Train_Line_3904 A requisite cofactor for TET2-mediated conversion of 5mC to 5hmC is alpha-ketogluterate, the product of an essential oxidative step of isocitrate in the Krebs cycle.
Train_Line_3905 WT1 was first identified as a tumor suppressor gene in patients with the WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, and mental retardation) tumor predisposition syndrome.
Train_Line_3906 It processes premessenger RNA (pre-mRNA) into mature mRNA and controls the diversity of splice variants.
Train_Line_3907 A major problem with the use of KIT inhibitors is either primary or secondary resistance due to D816 mutations and the lack of good drugs to target them.
Train_Line_3908 These discoveries led to the clinical development of JAK inhibitors, which are now approved for patients with primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_3909 SOCS1 and/or SOCS3 expression in MPD patients may be abnormal as a result of CpG island methylation, aberrant signal transduction pathways or another unknown mechanism.
Train_Line_3910 DDX41 is expressed in CD14+, CD33+, and CD34+ myeloid cells (Figures S5A and S5B), consistent with a function in hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_3911 Furthermore, it was associated with shorter OS in younger patients, but not in older ones, and predicted shorter TTL in younger patients as well as in lower-risk patient subgroups.
Train_Line_3912 Histopathological studies in erythromelalgia have revealed platelet-rich arteriolar microthrombi with endothelial inflammation and intimal proliferation accompanied by increased platelet consumption that is coupled with abundant VW factor deposition.
Train_Line_3913 In the study by Walter et al, the 2 most frequently mutated genes were TP53 and U2AF1: this likely reflects the fact that their patient cohort included a low proportion of low risk and a high proportion of high-risk MDS subtypes.
Train_Line_3914 Though the MDS patients in this study were treated heterogeneously, most of them received conservative and supportive care.
Train_Line_3915 Despite its longer duration, the outpatient arm required less time in hospital and fewer red cell and platelet transfusions.
Train_Line_3916 EZH2 codes for 1 of the 2 possible catalytic subunits of PRC2.
Train_Line_3917 In addition to the 18 genes we had previously characterized in these samples, we examined the mutational status of DNMT3A and the three most frequently mutated splicing factor genes (SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1), which were recently reported to be recurrently mutated in MDS.
Train_Line_3918 Autophagy was shown to be another mechanism by which GIST cell lines avoid death on treatment with KIT inhibitors.
Train_Line_3919 Positivity of WT1 mutations or older age was scored +1 individually, whereas NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD- or CEBPA double-mutation was scored -1.
Train_Line_3920 More than 30 clones were selected for sequencing as previously described.
Train_Line_3921 An allele-specific polymerase chain reaction for JAK2V617F was used to determine the allelic ratio of the mutated JAK2 allele in DNA samples extracted from bone marrow biopsies.
Train_Line_3922 Genetic Characterization of Lower-IPSS-Risk MDS.
Train_Line_3923 The nonrandom pattern of abnormalities within complex karyotypes includes a paucity of balanced rearrangements, and a predominance of chromosomal imbalances; losses most frequently affect 5q, 17p, and 7q, and gains 8q, 11q, and 21q.
Train_Line_3924 Sample identity was confirmed by matching fingerprint genotype calls.
Train_Line_3925 7. Management of younger adults: 18 to 60 years.
Train_Line_3926 Detection of mutations in U2AF1 exon 2 and exon 6 on BM cells was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_3927 SOCS1 binds phosphorylated JAK2 directly, whereas SOCS3 inhibits JAK2 while bound to a cytokine receptor, e.g. erythropoietin receptor.
Train_Line_3928 Table 2. Clinicopathological correlations in JAK2-V67F positive vs negative RARS-T.
Train_Line_3929 In aggregate, we identified mutations in 204 of 288 samples from patients with lower-risk MDS (71% of the cohort), including 70% of patients with a normal karyotype.
Train_Line_3930 Two patients (patients 60 and 92) lost the original ASXL1 mutation at remission status following transplantation.
Train_Line_3931 In our transplantation cohort, samples with complex cytogenetics had a high frequency of TP53 mutations (57%), and TP53 mutations occurred almost exclusively in patients with complex karyotypes (89% v 17%; P < .001).
Train_Line_3932 One potential mechanism of ring sideroblast formation might be the reduced expression of the gene ABCB7, which is essential for hematopoiesis and mitochondrial iron homeostasis and is mutated in the congenital sideroblastic anemia associated with spinocerebellar ataxia.
Train_Line_3933 Index patient.
Train_Line_3934 Overall survival was measured from the day of initial sampling to death from any cause (patients lost to follow up were censored) or last follow up and was summarized using Kaplan-Meier plots and analyzed using the Cox proportional hazard model.
Train_Line_3935 The founding member of the TET family is TET1.
Train_Line_3936 Patients and Methods.
Train_Line_3937 DNA SAMPLES.
Train_Line_3938 In addition, the MPLS505N mutation, initially described in familial ET, was also found in sporadic MPN.
Train_Line_3939 We recently reported on IDH1 and IDH2 mutational frequencies among 1473 patients with BCR-ABL1-negative MPN, 1-4% in chronic-phase MPN and approximately 25% in blast-phase polycythemia vera or primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_3940 Approximately 50 to 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis carry a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2), and an additional 5 to 10% have activating mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor gene (MPL).
Train_Line_3941 Mutation analysis was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_3942 Using an ad hoc assay, Wang et al found alterations in pre-mRNA splicing in tumor samples from CLL patients carrying a somatic mutation of SF3B1.
Train_Line_3943 Therefore, loss of SH2B3 function could occur via decreased binding affinity to its targets.
Train_Line_3944 METHODS.
Train_Line_3945 In AML, co-occurrence of NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations is associated with a good clinical outcome.
Train_Line_3946 CLINICAL TRIALS OF KIT INHIBITORS.
Train_Line_3947 Therefore, prospective, larger trials of uniformly treated patients are needed to confirm the effect of mutations on patient outcome.
Train_Line_3948 In addition some LNK mutations were associated with JAK2V617F, although it is not known whether LNK mutants and JAK2V617F were present in the same cell.
Train_Line_3949 Patients with AML received aggressive chemotherapy; conversely, patients with MDS in our study and patients with CMML were not treated aggressively.
Train_Line_3950 The outcome after allogeneic HSCT from fully matched unrelated donors (defined by molecular high-resolution HLA typing) appears to be similar compared with allogeneic HSCT from matched related donors.
Train_Line_3951 Figure 1. Identification of new germline p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del variants in the highly conserved zinc finger 2 domain of GATA2 that is associated with MDS-AML. (a) Pedigrees containing the p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del variants. One family from Australia (pedigree 1) and two families from the United States (pedigrees 2 and 3) show the p.Thr354Met variant segregating with MDS-AML, and one family from the United States (pedigree 4) has a p.Thr355del variant that segregates with MDS. The genotype of tested individuals is shown: T354 (Thr354, Thr354) and T354M (Thr354, Met354). (b) Domain structure of GATA2 showing the positions of the alterations. The positions of the p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del, AML-M5 (ref. 7) (green) and CML blast crisis (black) alterations are shown with respect to zinc finger (ZF) 1 and 2, the transactivation domain (TA) and the nuclear localization signal (NLS). (c) The zinc finger 2 (ZF2) domain of GATA2 and GATA3 contains alterations associated with leukemia and breast cancer. The primary sequence is that of human GATA2, with the two alternative residues in GATA3 ZF2 shown (light gray with black letters). The positions of p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del are highlighted, along with alterations found in GATA2 in AML-M5 (ref. 7) (green) and CML blast crisis (black), and alterations in GATA3 in breast cancer (summarized in ref. 8) (mutated residues in the corresponding GATA3 ZF2 are gray with white letters).
Train_Line_3952 CEBPA double-mutation and NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD- were independent favorable factors for RFS.
Train_Line_3953 Interestingly, 4 patients had multiple mutations likely to exist as independent clones or on alternate alleles, suggestive of clonal evolution. "Deeper" sequencing of 96 patient samples identified 4 additional mutations (RMA, 3%-6.3%).
Train_Line_3954 All mutations were confirmed in nonamplified genomic DNA in an independent experiment.
Train_Line_3955 Mononuclear cells from patient samples were enriched by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were stored at -196--degrees--C in liquid nitrogen until use.
Train_Line_3956 Table 3. Multivariable Overall Survival Models for IPSS and LR-PSS.
Train_Line_3957 FMS-like tyrosine kinase III (FLT3) mutations occur in one-third of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and predict poor outcome.
Train_Line_3958 Required in patients with clinical symptoms suspicious of central nervous system involvement; patient should be evaluated by imaging study for intracranial bleeding, leptomeningeal disease, and mass lesion; lumbar puncture considered optional in other settings (eg, high WBC).
Train_Line_3959 Here we provide evidence that better survival probability is significantly associated with JAK2V617F mutation status.
Train_Line_3960 Duplicate reactions with 5 muL aliquots of cDNA were used for realtime PCR in a final volume of 25 muL containing 1X SYBR Green mix (Stratagene), 0.3 muM of each primer and 0.03 muM of ROX reference dye (Stratagene).
Train_Line_3961 For CBF AML, retrospective studies by CALGB suggest that 3 or more cycles of HiDAC (cumulative dose: 54-72 g/m2) are superior to only one cycle (18 g/m2).
Train_Line_3962 Two classes of MPNs may thus exist; a simple one, in which a single JAK2 or MPL mutation induces PV or ET, and a complex class, with 2 or more mutations producing PMF.
Train_Line_3963 In addition, because of the potential risk for bleeding, low-risk patients with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 109/L) are considered separately (Table IV).
Train_Line_3964 GO (see section 11.1) can produce remissions in older patients, especially those relapsing after a prolonged (> 6 months) CR1.
Train_Line_3965 In contrast, DNMT3A was mutated in 4 of 30 patients (13.3%) and BCOR in 5 of 30 patients (16.6%).
Train_Line_3966 Comorbidity scoring is a current field of investigation and should contribute to a better definition of the patient considered "unfit" for intensive chemotherapy
Train_Line_3967 The original ASXL1 mutation was detected in 2 of the 10 clones analyzed.
Train_Line_3968 Thus, BCR-ABL-negative MPN resembles CML with some significant differences.
Train_Line_3969 Bar-coded libraries were run on a 100 Mb chip on an Ion PGM Sequencer (Life Technologies).
Train_Line_3970 Furthermore, the WT1 mutation was an independent poor risk factor for OS and RFS among total cohort and CN-AML patients.
Train_Line_3971 No IDH1 mutation was detected by direct sequencing at diagnosis in this patient, but by more sensitive TA cloning technique, one of the 40 clones showed IDH1 mutation.
Train_Line_3972 Our observations suggest that RARS-T may result from a combination of SF3B1 and JAK2 (or MPL) mutations, responsible for myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features, respectively.
Train_Line_3973 Nonmyeloablative, RIC allogeneic HSCT is under investigation for those who are not eligible for standard myeloablative HSCT.
Train_Line_3974 The major region of KIT mutation in GIST is within exon 11 occurring in about 65% of patients.
Train_Line_3975 The oncogenic mechanism of mutant IDH is incompletely understood and both decreased supply of a-ketoglutarate and abnormal accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate have been implicated in this regard.
Train_Line_3976 As compared with patients with a CALR mutation, patients with a JAK2 mutation had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 2.0 to 4.7; P<0.001), as did those with an MPL mutation (hazard ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.7; P<0.001).
Train_Line_3977 All study patients were fully characterized for karyotype IDH1, IDH2, JAK2 and MPL mutational status.
Train_Line_3978 The cause of the close association between M6 and WT1 mutations is not clear.
Train_Line_3979 We hypothesized that activation of JAK-STAT signaling in these patients might result from activating mutations in cytokine receptors, which led to the discovery of a novel mutation in MPL (MPLW515L) in patients with JAK2V617F-negative MF.
Train_Line_3980 The WT1 mutation did not correlate with the expression of the antigens studied (data not shown).
Train_Line_3981 C/EBPalpha is expressed at high levels in terminally differentiated, mature liver hepatocytes, while it is virtually absent in regenerating liver and hepatomas suggesting that C/EBPalpha expression might be inversely correlated with proliferation.
Train_Line_3982 At the time of sacrifice, MPLW515L-expressing mice showed splenomegaly and hepatomegaly (Figure 3C and 3D), and staining of bone marrow demonstrated increased reticulin fibrosis in MPLW515L, but not MPLWT-expressing mice (Figure 3E).
Train_Line_3983 Nonetheless, the notion that myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms can share mutant genes is potentially interesting, as shown by a study on TET2 mutations in malignant lymphomas.
Train_Line_3984 Of these 3, UPC 682G codes had 2 mutations, which were found in the same DNA molecule and therefore resided in the same mutant clone, whereas the other 2 patients had mutations found in different DNA molecules and therefore resided in different clones or on alternate alleles, as illustrated for UPC 55 in Figure 2.
Train_Line_3985 No significant cytosine methylation was seen for any of the cases studied here, irrespective of mutation status and WHO subtype of MDS.
Train_Line_3986 In this study, we examined the DNA of 193 patients with MDS for the presence of mutations in IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R172 and R140), and NPM1 by direct sequencing, and evaluated the prognostic impact of these mutations.
Train_Line_3987 The DNMT3A and TET2 genes encode epigenetic modifiers that regulate DNA methylation, and both are recurrently mutated in MDS, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematologic malignancies.
Train_Line_3988 The distribution of World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups, and cytogenetic risk groups is shown in Table 1 and supplemental Tables 2 and 3 (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Train_Line_3989 The most common mutation was c.1934dupG that occurred in 66 patients.
Train_Line_3990 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_3991 These observations prompted us to examine the role of C/EBPalpha in human lung cancer.
Train_Line_3992 qRT-PCR with TaqMan Probes.
Train_Line_3993 Biobanking should also be performed in general practice if at all possible.
Train_Line_3994 JAK2 phosphorylates histone H3 and excludes HP1a from chromatin.
Train_Line_3995 Primers were designed to amplify the coding sequences and splice sites of DNMT3A (provided in 15).
Train_Line_3996 Luciferase reporter assay experiments showed that GATA2 p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del had reduced transactivation ability compared to wild-type on known GATA2 responsive enhancers (RUNX1 and CD34) and the LYL1 promoter (Fig. 3a-c).
Train_Line_3997 In this cohort mainly composed of MDS patients with low/intermediate-1 IPSS, the impact of BCOR mutations on the response to treatment like azacitidine could not be studied.
Train_Line_3998 GIST.
Train_Line_3999 Unlike the case with acute myeloid leukemia, there is limited information on the prognostic impact of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Train_Line_4000 Another area of induction therapy research is the evaluation of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) administered with conventional chemotherapy (see section 11.1).
Train_Line_4001 In multivariate analysis including IDH1 mutation status, IPSS score, transfusion dependence, and karyotype, the presence of IDH1 mutations was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for event-free survival (Table 4).
Train_Line_4002 DNMT3A and SF3B1 Mutations Commonly Co-Occur.
Train_Line_4003 Both twins showed a germline DDX41 variant (c.T1187C; p.I396T; Figure 1B; Figure S1D).
Train_Line_4004 TET2 mutations are found in approximately 14% of MPNs ranging from ET (11%) to PMF (19%).
Train_Line_4005 Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was defined as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis and the date of leukemic transformation (for patients who progressed to AML) or last follow-up (for censored patients).
Train_Line_4006 On the other hand, all 142 patients without IDH mutations at diagnosis remained IDH-wild during disease evolution except one who acquired an IDH mutation during follow-up; however the mutation could be detected in the initial sample by using a more sensitive cloning technique.
Train_Line_4007 The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is <1%/1% in ET and <3%/10% in PV.
Train_Line_4008 An acquired valine to phenylalanine mutation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) at position 617 is present in the vast majority of patients with polycythemia vera (PV).
Train_Line_4009 Germline SH2B3 changes, therefore, could affect the MPN phenotype and possibly the therapeutic response to novel agents.
Train_Line_4010 Second, the detection of subclonal driver mutations associated with small clones may allow early diagnosis of disease progression, including evolution into AML.
Train_Line_4011 In patients with a dysfunctional C/EBPalpha pathway, targeted therapies may overcome the block in differentiation, and in combination with conventional chemotherapy, may lead to complete eradication of the malignant clone.
Train_Line_4012 To this end, a number of targeted sequencing, exome sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing studies have been performed in AML patients in the last 5 to 10 years.
Train_Line_4013 Sequence variants - differences from the reference human genome sequence - were identified in each sample separately, and variants present in the paired normal DNA or likely representing sequencing errors were removed using the SAVI algorithm (Statistical Algorithm for Variant Identification) developed at Columbia University (supplemental Figure 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Train_Line_4014 Written informed consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the studies were approved by the institutional review board of Hannover Medical School.
Train_Line_4015 Silencing of tumor suppressor genes by hypermethylation is common in human cancers including leukemias.
Train_Line_4016 SAMPLE COLLECTION AND CELL SEPARATION.
Train_Line_4017 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_4018 Sunitinib was developed as an inhibitor of mutants with imatinib-resistance due to secondary mutation in the drug binding residues, T670I and V654A of KIT.
Train_Line_4019 In low risk patients, this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin in both PV and ET and phlebotomy (hematocrit target of <45%) in PV.
Train_Line_4020 Similar to younger adults, induction therapy generally consists of 3 days of an anthracycline (eg, daunorubicin 45-60 mg/m2 or an alternative anthracycline at equivalent dose), and 7 days of cytarabine (100-200 mg/m2 continuous IV).
Train_Line_4021 The primary goal of our analysis was to evaluate the impact of DNMT3A mutations on outcome parameters such as CR rate, RFS, and OS in a uniformly treated cohort of patients with AML in the context of most other known prognostic markers in AML.
Train_Line_4022 Thus, one challenge to developing targeted epigenetic therapies has been in developing therapies to specifically inhibit 1 epigenetic-regulatory protein or enzyme without affecting other epigenetic regulators.
Train_Line_4023 Abbreviations: PB, peripheral blood; BM, bone marrow; FAB, French-American-British classification; CBF, core binding factor; LDAC, low-dose cytarabine (cytarabine 100 mg/m2 as a continuous infusion x 5 days); HDAC, high-dose cytarabine (cytarabine 3 g/m2 by intravenous bolus over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, or cytarabine 400 mg/m2 /d as a continuous infusion x 5 days); CR, complete remission; CIR, cumulative incidence of relapse.
Train_Line_4024 Knockdown of Brcc3 gene expression in murine bone marrow lineage negative, Sca1 positive, c-kit positive cells resulted in 2-fold more colony formation and modest differentiation defect.
Train_Line_4025 A review of randomized trials in AML found a significant reduction in fungal infection-related mortality and invasive fungal infection in patients given antifungal prophylaxis rather than placebo while the difference in all-cause mortality was borderline significant.
Train_Line_4026 FAB indicates French-American-British subtype; NM, no mitosis; and --, negative (no other mutation found).
Train_Line_4027 When an initiating driver mutation gives rise to a malignant clone (neoplastic transformation), all background or passenger mutations present at that time are captured and carried forward.
Train_Line_4028 Technical details regarding sample procession for SNP array assays were previously described (Maciejewski et al, 2009; Gondek et al, 2008).
Train_Line_4029 In contrast to our findings, this study failed to demonstrate significantly raised expression in granulocytes from patients with PV but only seven patients were examined (compared to 20 in our analysis) and a different control gene and SOCS1 primers were used.
Train_Line_4030 Among the 16 patients who had paired samples for serial study both at diagnosis and at relapse, 13 patients retained the original mutation at first relapse, but one of them (no. 26) lost the mutation at second relapse (Table 5).
Train_Line_4031 Confirmation of methylation status was validated by nested polymerase chain reaction and/or bisulphite sequencing.
Train_Line_4032 Overall, with the exception of one patient, all those with CK and single TP53 mutation (7/8, 88%) had alteration at the 17p locus irrespective of their mutant allele burden.
Train_Line_4033 The x-ray structure of the C/EBPalpha protein-DNA interaction was recently solved, and several critical basic region residues were identified.
Train_Line_4034 TABLE III. Comparison of Other Genetic Alterations Between MDS Patients with and without the IDH Mutation.
Train_Line_4035 In 2011, whole-exome sequencing studies showed recurrent somatic mutations of SF3B1 and other genes of the RNA splicing machinery in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm.
Train_Line_4036 TET2 has 9 coding exons.
Train_Line_4037 TP53 mutations in 9.4% of MDS patients in our large single institution study is slightly higher than in previous reports (Jonveaux et al 1991; Ludwig et al 1992; Lai et al 1995), although some reports have shown frequencies around 11-14% (Wattel et al 1994; Kaneko et al 1995; Kita-Sasai et al 2001).
Train_Line_4038 Survival analysis of DNMT3A mutated compared with wild-type patients in all investigated patients with AML showed a significant negative prognostic effect of DNMT3A mutations for OS that remained significant in multivariate analysis.
Train_Line_4039 U2AF35 mutations are rare in MDS, but can be seen in CMML (10-13%), MPN (2%), and therapy related/secondary AML (~10%).
Train_Line_4040 The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion.
Train_Line_4041 In PV, a higher JAK2V617F mutant allele burden has been associated with pruritus and fibrotic transformation.
Train_Line_4042 We performed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatic mutations responsible for the initiation of disease in these subsets of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_4043 Regarding diagnosis, the detection of a cytogenetic aberration in a patient with peripheral cytopenia and bone marrow dysplasia provides an important marker of clonal proliferation.
Train_Line_4044 The response to hypomethylating agents will be an important association to explore in large retrospective studies, and prospectively in future clinical trials.
Train_Line_4045 In particular, prognostic molecular abnormalities that do not have readily evident clinical manifestations are the most important to consider.
Train_Line_4046 Due to the marginal male dominance (odds ratio; 2.00, 0.84-4.73) of BRCC3 mutations, the majority of mutations (n=23; 82%) were hemizygous.
Train_Line_4047 In addition, a small-molecule JAK kinase inhibitor inhibits proliferation of MPLW515L-transformed cells, suggesting that targeted inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling may be an effective therapy for both JAK2V617F-positive and MPLW515L-positive MPD.
Train_Line_4048 C/EBPalpha mutations have not been described in cases of t(8;21) or inv16 AML.
Train_Line_4049 Of note is that all the low-abundance mutations seen here were predicted to abrogate protein function and therefore were unlikely to be background or neutral events.
Train_Line_4050 Only two amplicons failed to produce adequate sequence coverage (amplicon 0001788_083, covering 5' UTR in exon 1;amplicon 0001788_055, covering exon 14).
Train_Line_4051 We also sequentially analyzed the U2AF1 mutation in 421 samples from 142 patients to determine its stability during the disease courses.
Train_Line_4052 5hmc may have a function by itself and/or represent a step toward cytosine demethylation.
Train_Line_4053 In a recent randomized study, 365 adult patients with PV were treated with a target hematocrit of <45% or 45 to 50%, after a median follow-up of 31 months, the primary end point of thrombotic events or deaths from cardiovascular causes was recorded in 5 of 182 patients in the low-hematocrit group (2.7%) and 18 of 183 patients in the high-hematocrit group (9.8%) (P = 0.007), supporting the current practice of keeping the hematocrit below 45% in patients with PV.
Train_Line_4054 Cytogenetic analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for recurrent cytogenetic lesions were performed as described initially by Slovak et al and as used previously, with central review by the ECOG Cytogenetic Subcommittee.
Train_Line_4055 The 34 patients with no amplifiable DNA did not exhibit any statistically significant differences from the 23 cases studied with regard to clinical/pathological features (p values >0.05).
Train_Line_4056 Bone marrow examination is not essential for the diagnosis of PV because patients who otherwise fulfill the diagnostic criteria for PV are labeled as having PV even if they display substantial bone marrow fibrosis (Table II).
Train_Line_4057 Age was initially modeled as a continuous covariate but was then parameterized as a binary variable with respect to a cut-point.
Train_Line_4058 There is no general consensus on the cutoff point for considering an acute leukemia to be positive for a marker.
Train_Line_4059 One important question to answer will be to identify the effect of epigenetic targeted therapies on differentiation of normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells as opposed to merely inducing leukemic cell death.
Train_Line_4060 Germline DDX41 lesions define a hereditary MDS/AML syndrome that is characterized by long latency, advanced disease (high-risk MDS/AML), normal karyotype, and poor prognosis.
Train_Line_4061 The only exception to the rule known thus far is isolated del(5q), which characterizes the 5q- syndrome: in fact, haploinsufficiency for RPS14 and miR-145, mapping to the common deleted region, represents the pathophysiological basis of this MDS subtype.
Train_Line_4062 Finally, it is important to consider TRM that may vary between less than 15% and up to 50%.
Train_Line_4063 Both mutations at R882 and mutations at any other position in DNMT3A appeared to be associated with a negative prognostic impact on OS (Data Supplement Figure S2).
Train_Line_4064 The discovery of mutations in specific epigenetic modifiers in patients with AML has furthered our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disorder.
Train_Line_4065 The first report described a germline 212delC N-terminal C/EBPalpha mutation in two siblings and their father with AML.
Train_Line_4066 The process by which the founding malignant clone generates subclones through the acquisition of additional driver mutations.
Train_Line_4067 Patients with short initial first remissions may be candidates for an investigational drug.
Train_Line_4068 Survival time was measured from the date of randomization to the date of death for patients who died and to the date of the last follow-up for those who were alive at the time of the analysis.
Train_Line_4069 To date, only two MDS-AML predisposition genes have been recognized: RUNX1 (also known as AML1), encoding Runt-related transcription factor 1, and CEBPA, encoding CCAAT-enhancer binding protein alpha (reviewed in ref. 3).
Train_Line_4070 All trials were approved by the local ethics committees of all participating institutions; all patients gave informed consent for treatment, cryopreservation of samples, and molecular analyses according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_4071 Independent experiments confirmed mutations in all cases and allowed accurate estimates of RMA.
Train_Line_4072 - Unbalanced changes: -7 or del(7q); -5 or del(5q); i(17q) or t(17p); -13 or del(13q); del(11q); del(12p) or t(12p); del(9q); idic(X)(q13).
Train_Line_4073 An evaluation of the data from the overall cohort in the E1900 trial showed that the distribution of patients among genetic risk categories in both treatment groups was similar to the distribution in our cohort of 502 patients (P = 0.41 by Pearson's chi-square test).
Train_Line_4074 We have previously shown that RARS-T develops from RARS through the occurrence of a subclonal driver mutation in JAK2 or MPL in the initial SF3B1 mutated clone.
Train_Line_4075 In addition to cases with a strong family history of MDS/AML (families 1-7), a cohort of 1,034 patients with MDS and sAML was subjected to a targeted screening by NGS (Table S1).
Train_Line_4076 Akin to the Philadelphia chromosome in CML, discovery studies in 2005 identified the JAK2 V617F mutation in the overwhelming majority of patients with polycythemia vera as well as 40-60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Train_Line_4077 This may explain the reduced binding of p.Thr354Met to DNA (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Train_Line_4078 A randomized phase 3 trial has been initiated evaluating midostaurin as frontline therapy of younger adult AML patients with activating FLT3 mutations (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00651261).
Train_Line_4079 The molecular mechanisms underlying iron accumulation in the mitochondria of immature RBCs from patients with RARS are currently being investigated.
Train_Line_4080 We compared the effects of Setd2 knockdown in hemato poietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) derived from wildtype or knock-in mice.
Train_Line_4081 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_4082 This observation points to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay as one likely mechanism for BCOR gene inactivation by these mutations.
Train_Line_4083 The fundamental problem is that the spliceosome controls the expression of thousands of genes and it is therefore difficult to identify those that are relevant for clonal expansion of a hematopoietic cell.
Train_Line_4084 Pre-mRNA needs splicing process to become mature mRNA for further translation into proteins.
Train_Line_4085 We, therefore, showed that IDH1 mutations are rare but recurrent molecular aberrations in MDS patients, and establish IDH1/2 mutations as one of the most frequent mutations in AML arising from MDS (15%).
Train_Line_4086 Ruxolitinib induces a reduction in leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, and anemia/thrombocytopenia was a dose limiting adverse effect for 63% of patients in the phase I/II trial which is attenuated with more flexible dosing regimens.
Train_Line_4087 Significantly, relevant levels of mutant clones were not detected in paired skin samples, confirming the acquired nature of these mutations.
Train_Line_4088 Further, the deficiency of the BAP1, a nuclear-localized deubiquitinating enzyme, resulted in a CMML-like phenotype, and the interaction with ASXL1 is critical for the enzymatic activity of BAP1.
Train_Line_4089 The mutations in CALR that were found by means of whole-exome sequencing were confirmed and shown to be somatic by means of Sanger sequencing of the granulocyte and matched T-lymphocyte DNA samples from all six patients.
Train_Line_4090 No significant clinical differences were observed between MPLW515L-positive versus MPLW515L-negative patients with MF with regard to median age at presentation and to disease duration, though the statistical power of this analysis was limited by the small number of patients with MF in our cohort.
Train_Line_4091 In accordance with this finding, we detected increased phosphorylation of STAT5 in the Ba/F3 cells with the 52-bp deletion, both in the absence and in the presence of stimulation by interleukin-3.
Train_Line_4092 Median OS for MDS patients with FLT3 mutation was 19 months compared to 16 months for those without FLT3 mutation (P = 0.08; Fig. 1).
Train_Line_4093 While new drugs such as sunitinib are effective on the most common of these, this drug is not effective on activation loop mutations.
Train_Line_4094 In younger patients (< 60 years of age) with normal karyotype (n = 121), the incidence of WT1 mutation was 8.3%.
Train_Line_4095 Prior to the discovery of frequent KIT mutation in GIST and the advent of targeted kinase inhibitors, metastatic GIST was refractory to existing therapy and median survival was around 18 months.
Train_Line_4096 In other words, low level of IDH mutant was already present at diagnosis in this patient which expanded during disease progression.
Train_Line_4097 No deletions or LOH events were detected in these three samples (suggesting that the apparent LOH at these isolated SNPs were sequencing artifacts).
Train_Line_4098 Mutant allele burden or VAF: The relative proportion of a mutant or variant allele (i.e., the allele carrying a somatic mutation) in a tissue or tumor sample.
Train_Line_4099 At a lower frequency, mutations in IDH2 affecting the analogous amino acid (R172) have also been described in oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas.
Train_Line_4100 ZRSR2-mut patients clustered in International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-1 and intermediate-2 risk groups, had higher percentages of bone marrow blasts, and more often displayed isolated neutropenias.
Train_Line_4101 Mutant forms of KIT are drivers of several cancers including GIST, SM and subsets of AML, melanoma and testicular seminomas.
Train_Line_4102 Purpose.
Train_Line_4103 For multivariable analysis, a conditional model was used with an age cut-point at 60 years to address the different treatment intensities applied in the different age cohorts.
Train_Line_4104 Primary myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia with excess of blasts (MDS-RAEB) with -7, del(12)(p12).
Train_Line_4105 In this study with a relatively larger cohort of MDS patients, though ASXL1, RUNX1, and DNMT3A mutations were the three most common concurrent mutations in the 36 patients with U2AF1 mutation, there was no significant difference in the frequency of these concurrent genetic mutations between the patients with and without U2AF1 mutation.
Train_Line_4106 However, the genetic data in these two studies provide critical insight into the role of CALR mutations in the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms and suggest an important role for CALR mutations in altering JAK-STAT signaling.
Train_Line_4107 In the last decade the genetic underpinnings of MPNs have continued to expand, leading to the discovery of novel classes of genes - those involved in epigenetic regulation - thus leading to a reshaping of the two-hit model to the entire spectrum of myeloid malignancies including MPN patients.
Train_Line_4108 Both IPSS and WPSS are currently used for clinical prognostication of MDS.
Train_Line_4109 Mononuclear cells were separated from bone marrow samples by standard density gradient centrifugation, and granulocytes were isolated from peripheral blood as previously described.
Train_Line_4110 The mixtures were resolved in 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels made in 0.5x TGE buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 85 mM glycine and 0.5 mM EDTA), and the electrophoresis was performed at 4 --degrees--C.
Train_Line_4111 We applied mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) to further obtain the gene expression profile of the Mll-Af9 pre-leukemic cells from the first plating after Setd2 knockdown.
Train_Line_4112 Transfection of BaF3-E cells was done with the Nucleofector technology (Lonza, Cologne, Germany).
Train_Line_4113 Such leukemias should not be treated as AML, but rather as ALL with incorporation of an ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with chemotherapy.
Train_Line_4114 SRSF2 mutations were seen in 40% of cases (100% with P95 as a mutational hotspot), while SF3B1 (primarily K700E) and U2AF35 mutations (mostly S34F and Q157P/R) were seen in 6 and 9%, respectively.
Train_Line_4115 Variables with P <= .1 in univariate analysis for OS were included in the model.
Train_Line_4116 The expansion of clonal T cells has been shown to be caused by somatic mutations of STAT3 or STAT5b.
Train_Line_4117 Bone marrow aspirates from the 288 patients in our cohort were previously examined for mutations in 18 genes, including TET2, ASXL1, TP53, RUNX1, EZH2, ETV6, and NRAS.
Train_Line_4118 Blood and marrow smears are morphologically examined using a May-Grunwald-Giemsa or a Wright-Giemsa stain.
Train_Line_4119 We identified 150 samples (17% of the patients) with insertions or deletions in CALR that were independently validated by means of Sanger sequencing.
Train_Line_4120 The IKZF1 gene encodes for the Ikaros transcription factor, which regulates the development of B and T cells.
Train_Line_4121 MDS with isolated 5q- characterized predominantly by heterozygous TP53 mutations, lack of 17p chromosomal aberrations, coupled with activated TP53 secondary to RPS14 haploinsufficiency is biologically distinct to CK with -5/5q- with TP53 mutations which are often associated with loss of 17p and have an extremely dismal prognosis.
Train_Line_4122 In multivariate analysis that included ASXL1 mutation status, transfusion dependence, IDH1 mutation status, and karyotype, the presence of ASXL1 mutation was an independent, unfavorable prognostic factor for OS when considering only frameshift mutations (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.34; P = .04; Table 3), whereas, when considering both frameshift and point mutations combined, ASXL1 mutations had no independent impacton OS (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.88 to 2.60; P = .14; Table A2).
Train_Line_4123 In this comprehensive analysis of 193 MDS patients, we identified mutations in at least 1 of the investigated genes involved in the splicing machinery (ie, SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1) in 34.7% of all investigated patients, suggesting that gene mutations involved in the splicing pathway are the most common mutations in MDS reported to date.
Train_Line_4124 These experiments also negated sampling errors for mutation abundance by achieving a higher combined sequencing coverage.
Train_Line_4125 Total BM DNA (100 ng) was bisulphite-treated using Qiagen EpiTect plus reagents.
Train_Line_4126 Bisulphite-modified DNA from patients, normal individuals or the methylated control (0.5 mug) was amplified by PCR in a 25 muL reaction volume containing 1X PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP and 1 muM of each primer using 1.25 units AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems) on a thermal cycler (PTC-200, MJ Research Inc., MA, USA).
Train_Line_4127 Conclusions.
Train_Line_4128 Should be performed if chromosome morphology is of poor quality, or if there is typical morphology but the suspected cytogenetic abnormality is not present.
Train_Line_4129 These features may be driven by activated JAK2 signaling in a subset of RARS-T.
Train_Line_4130 Deep sequencing technologies show that BCOR mutations commonly arise after other concomitant mutations in MDS.
Train_Line_4131 Targeting synergising oncogenes.
Train_Line_4132 To assess the consequences of BCOR mutations at the protein level, 5 BCOR-mutated AML patients with available material for protein analysis were studied by Western blotting, and compared with CD34+ hematopoietic cells from 2 normal donors and 19 AML patients devoid of BCOR mutations.
Train_Line_4133 Recent data suggest that patients age 60 or older with CN-AML and mutated NPM1 (with or without FLT3-ITD) benefit from standard "3 + 7" regimens.
Train_Line_4134 BCOR mutations were significantly enriched in RUNX1-mut patients (17% vs 3% in RUNX1-wt patients; P = .002) and DNMT3A-mut patients (13% vs 3% in DNMT3A-wt patients; P = .015; Figure 1B).
Train_Line_4135 The clinical correlations of the other 2 prevalent mutations involving the splicing machinery, U2AF35 and SF3B1, have been explored, whereas there have been few similar reports about SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_4136 All patients with secondary AML were treated within a trial of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine) (Clinical Trials Identifier NCT00866073) or multicenter treatment trials AML SHG 0295 and AML SHG 0199 (ClinicalTrials Identifier NCT00209833).
Train_Line_4137 The analyses were generated using SAS/STAT software (Version 9.2 of SAS System for Windows, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Train_Line_4138 In addition, homozygosity for TET2 mutations, defined as > 65% RMA, did not affect the OS.
Train_Line_4139 The prognostic impact of each mutated gene was calculated separately.
Train_Line_4140 This includes proteins involved in the modification of DNA cytosine residues and enzymes which catalyze posttranslational modifications of histones.
Train_Line_4141 p53 loss of function has been shown to be related to resistance to chemotherapy, also to cytarabine.
Train_Line_4142 Dysplasia in 50% or more of cells, in 2 or more hematopoietic cell lineages, was the diagnostic criterion for the former subset.
Train_Line_4143 Therefore, cytoreductive treatment is currently not recommended for low-risk women with ET that are either pregnant or wish to be pregnant.
Train_Line_4144 In this patient, SNP array karyotyping identified a UPD at the TET2 locus in the total bone marrow DNA (see below).
Train_Line_4145 When the authors compared the patients who transformed to those who did not, the former were older and more likely to have leukocytosis (known risk factor for leukemic transformation) at time of diagnosis or registration to the central database.
Train_Line_4146 The frequency of the leukemogenic allele of DDX41 in the general population is very low, and because of late presentation, some healthy carriers may still anticipate disease.
Train_Line_4147 Revised international prognosis scoring system: very low: <=1.5; low: >1.5-3; intermediate (INT): >3-4.5; high: >4.5-6; and very high: >6.
Train_Line_4148 In this situation, the risk of the disease has to be balanced with the risk of the transplant.
Train_Line_4149 SH2B3 EQ and GV were less inhibitory compared to WT SH2B3.
Train_Line_4150 Median follow-up for the cohort was 49 months (95% CI, 36 to 67).
Train_Line_4151 Restricting the analysis to JAK2 V617-wild type patients only, there was a trend towards reduced SOCS3 expression in patients carrying a methylated promoter compared to those without SOCS3 methylation (Figure 3D; granulocytes: 1.4+=2.2 v 9.0+=6.4, p=0.046; mononuclear cells: 0.3+=0.2 v 2.0+=1.8, p=0.09).
Train_Line_4152 The mutation frequency in primary MDS and tMDS/AML was 8.1% (24/296) and 27.3% (6/22) respectively.
Train_Line_4153 TET2 mutations might be associated with response to hypomethylating agents, whereas U2AF1 mutations would independently predict for poor outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_4154 Myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts are included in the blast count.
Train_Line_4155 ERRATA.
Train_Line_4156 The most frequent mutations in KRAS and NRAS occur at codons 12, 13, and 61, leading to an inhibition of the GTP-ase activity, thus allowing constitutive activation of effector pathways such as MAPK signaling and downstream transcriptional control.
Train_Line_4157 The 2-year survival rate was 52% and 14% for MDS patients with wild-type and mutated R132 IDH1, respectively.
Train_Line_4158 The OS for patients with mutations in 1 of the splicing genes not associated with ring sideroblasts (ie, U2AF1, SRSF2, and ZRSR2) was significantly lower compared with WT patients (HR = 1.81; 95% CI, 1.11-2.98; P = .018; supplemental Figure 3A) and these patients had a significantly higher rate for AML transformation (HR = 2.33; 95% CI, 1.22-4.46; P = .011; supplemental Figure 3B).
Train_Line_4159 IDH1 and IDH2 mutations.
Train_Line_4160 To date, only one JAK kinase inhibitor has been approved by the FDA, ruxolitinib, a JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, approved in August 2011 for use in intermediate and high-risk PMF and post PV/ET myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_4161 DNA was isolated from fresh consecutive sections from the original diagnostic paraffin-embedded tissue blocks cut at 5mum in Eppendorf tubes.
Train_Line_4162 Nevertheless, current data are difficult to interpret due to small patient cohorts, heterogeneity of conditioning regimens applied, and, most importantly, the considerable inherent patient selection bias in the higher age segment.
Train_Line_4163 In contrast to the initial results, which showed a targeted effect of JAK2 inhibitors on JAK2V617F cells, including HSC, there is increasing evidence that they also affect JAK2 wild-type and JAK2V617F cells although having less effect on JAK2V617F HSC.
Train_Line_4164 Accordingly, the goal of current therapy in PV and ET is primarily to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications, without increasing bleeding risk, and secondarily to control the aforementioned symptoms.
Train_Line_4165 Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to plot survival curves, and log-rank tests were used to test the difference between groups.
Train_Line_4166 However, the most striking advances regarding mutant genes have been made possible in the last 2 years by the use of next-generation sequencing technology.
Train_Line_4167 Management of High-Risk PV or ET.
Train_Line_4168 However, a relatively small number of cytogenetic and molecular lesions have sufficient relevance to influence clinical practice.
Train_Line_4169 No significant differences were seen in the hemograms and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels between patients with and without SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_4170 Overexpression of either SH2B3 EQ or GV in WT Sh2b3 BM resulted in less clonal inhibition compared to WT SH2B3 (Fig 1D).
Train_Line_4171 For patients with performance status less than 2 and no comorbidities, standard induction therapy is often a plausible option resulting in CR rates averaging 50% and rates of death in aplasia or from indeterminate cause below 15%.
Train_Line_4172 To date, this is the largest analysis of FLT3 mutations in MDS and CMML, either as individual diseases or as combined diagnosis.
Train_Line_4173 N-terminal mutants have been described to exert dominant-negative effects on the unmutated 42 kD C/EBPalpha protein isoform.
Train_Line_4174 HL-60 cells were stained for surface Annexin V and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol (#556547, Becton Dickinson).
Train_Line_4175 In our cohort, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations were mutually exclusive, and only two patients were identified to have concurrent U2AF1 and SF3B1 mutations.
Train_Line_4176 The safety and efficacy of busulfan treatment in ET was recently underlined by a long-term study of 36 patients above age 60 years of age; no instances of AML or other malignancies were documented after a median follow-up of 72 months.
Train_Line_4177 Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, California, United States) and analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
Train_Line_4178 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_4179 Genomic aberrations at the TET2 locus relating to SNP6 experiments are indicated.
Train_Line_4180 Two patients with the JAK2 (V617F) mutation also carried an SF3B1 mutation, and the SF3B1 mutant allele burden was greater than that for JAK2 mutation (57% vs 13% in one case, and 17% vs 10% in the other one).
Train_Line_4181 Associations between gene mutations are represented by a Circos diagram.
Train_Line_4182 These recommendations provide standard requirements for general practice and for clinical trials.
Train_Line_4183 ASXL1 expression greater than or less than the median had no significant impact on OS (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.74; P = .636) and time to AML progression (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.62 to 2.20; P = .638; Data Supplement), even if patients with ASXL1 point mutations were excluded (data not shown).
Train_Line_4184 TP53-altered CK-AML were characterized by a higher degree of genomic complexity (aberrations per case, 14.30 vs 6.16; P < .0001) and by a higher frequency of specific copy number alterations, such as -5/5q-, -7/7q-, -16/16q-, -18/18q-, +1/+1p, and +11/+11q/amp11q13~25; among CK-AMLs, TP53-altered more frequently exhibited a monosomal karyotype (MK).
Train_Line_4185 Therefore, there is currently no compelling evidence to support the need for JAK inhibitor therapy in the majority of patients with PV or ET, regardless of whether or not they are hydroxyurea-refractory.
Train_Line_4186 In the absence of crystal structures of PKC412 in complex with KIT or related kinases, docking into a homology model of the active FMS kinase has been used to predict the mode of drug binding.
Train_Line_4187 It has been isolated as a fusion partner of MLL in acute leukemia with the t(10;11)(q21;q32) chromosomal translocation.
Train_Line_4188 Interestingly, the restrictive pattern of coexisting mutations with TP53 mutations in MDS is an important observation, although exceptions to the rule, such as coexistence of U2AF1 and TP53, are observed.
Train_Line_4189 NGS Studies.
Train_Line_4190 The presence of mutant IDH2 did not affect the overall (P = 0.54) or leukemia-free (P = 0.81) survival (Tables 3 and 4).
Train_Line_4191 Another study of 24 patients with CMML showed the co-occurrence of ASXL1 and TET2 mutations in seven cases and ASXL1 and EZH2 mutations in two cases.
Train_Line_4192 The canonical somatic mutation of DDX41 (c.G1574A, p.R525H) was not detected.
Train_Line_4193 The price of whole genome sequencing is expected to drop below $1000 in the next years, whereas that of targeted gene sequencing should be definitely lower.
Train_Line_4194 In the first 10 years, the incidences of thrombotic events, acute leukemia, post-PV MF, and other malignancies were 16%, 5%, 4%, and 8%, respectively.
Train_Line_4195 Table 2. TET2 mutations and clinical details.
Train_Line_4196 In the current MDS study, the overwhelming majority of IDH mutations were IDH2R140Q.
Train_Line_4197 The ASXL1 mutation could be detected by TA cloning, but not by direct sequencing, in patient 1 at disease progression and in patient 108 at diagnosis.
Train_Line_4198 WES was performed as previously described (Yoshida et al, 2011).
Train_Line_4199 THE ROLE OF C/EBPalpha IN OTHER SOLID TUMORS.
Train_Line_4200 However, the primers utilized in their study correspond to the CpG island within exon 2 and the SOCS1 promoter region was not assessed.
Train_Line_4201 As similar efforts have begun to show significant benefit in MDS and AML, it is important for similar efforts in the MPN field to delineate whether genomic profiling can be used to improve outcomes for MPN patients.
Train_Line_4202 [END OF SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)].
Train_Line_4203 The most likely interpretation is that the acquisition of additional driver mutations leads to formation of subclones of hematopoietic cells with further impaired differentiation and/or maturation capacity.
Train_Line_4204 Therefore, drug-induced reduction in JAK2V617F allele burden might not necessarily translate into long-term benefit in ET or PV.
Train_Line_4205 Likewise, for the 97 patients with int-2/high-risk disease, the overall survival for TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients was equivalent (17.4 months; 95% CI: 3.3-31.4 vs 17.2 months; 95% CI: 11.3-23.0; P = .20).
Train_Line_4206 We then measured the interleukin-3-dependent proliferation of cells.
Train_Line_4207 Granulocytes from IMF patients showed moderately raised expression of SOCS1 (p=0.04 compared to the level in normal individuals; Figure 3A) but transcript level did not correlate with JAK2 V617F status (data not shown).
Train_Line_4208 HL-60 cells were first transduced with GEV16 lentiviral supernatant including 4 mug/ml polybrene and 2.5 mug/ml fungizone.
Train_Line_4209 By screening, we identified no mutation among 23 children with refractory anemia, but we observed missense mutations in exon 3 in 5 of 27 children with an excess of blasts (19%; 95% c.i. = 6-38%; Table 1).

Train_Line_4212 Thol et al analyzed the prognostic effect of ASXL1 point and frameshift mutations separately.
Train_Line_4213 Downregulation of c-myc is one of the critical steps of C/EBPalpha-mediated E2F repression and is required for granulocytic differentiation.
Train_Line_4214 HP1a binds to histone H3.
Train_Line_4215 Mutations in the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are found in many AML subtypes and are considered class I mutations conferring a proliferation and/or survival advantage.
Train_Line_4216 Further investigations are needed to understand how IDH mutations interact with these gene alterations in the pathogenesis of MDS.
Train_Line_4217 FTY720 also induced apoptosis in AML patient blasts harbouring D816V/Y KIT.
Train_Line_4218 All subjects provided informed consent on protocols approved by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.
Train_Line_4219 Mutants retain binding capacity for JAK2, an established SH2B3 target, as well as for the adaptor proteins 14-3-3 and CBL.
Train_Line_4220 Nine patients with a TET2 mutation had no detectable genomic aberrations.
Train_Line_4221 10.3 Salvage consolidation treatment including stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_4222 Only the 330 patients (including 28 with the WT1 mutation and 302 without) who received conventional intensive induction chemotherapy and then consolidation chemotherapy if CR was achieved, were included in the analysis.
Train_Line_4223 By DNA sequence analysis, 60% of cases exhibited TP53 mutations, consistent with previous reports.
Train_Line_4224 EXPRESSION PROFILING AND CDNA ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_4225 It is now becoming apparent that through these mechanisms, somatic mutations of the RNA splicing machinery can play a role in the pathogenesis of human cancers, in particular in the pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies.
Train_Line_4226 Despite these links with prognostically adverse clinical features, TP53 mutations have strong and independent prognostic significance for patients with MDS.
Train_Line_4227 Among patients with a TET2 aberration, there was no difference in OS between patients with a high (> 25% RMA) or low (<= 25%) level mutation (median OS: 26.0 months; 95% CI: 22.3-29.7 vs 35.0 months; 95% CI: 23.0-47.0; P = .45).
Train_Line_4228 Five microliters of each product were purified using 2 muL of ExoSAP-IT (USB Corporation, Cleveland, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and then diluted by the addition of 3 muL of water.
Train_Line_4229 This complex is activated in various cancers and downregulates transcription of tumor suppressor genes.
Train_Line_4230 Prominent features of complex karyotype cases are the frequent loss of 17p and/or TP53 gene mutation, occurring in approximately two-thirds of the cases, and a high prevalence of high-level DNA amplifications.
Train_Line_4231 Fig 2. Pathogenetic mechanisms of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) dysfunction. C/EBPalpha function is disturbed at various levels in acute leukemias. Promoter methylation leads to silencing of promoter activity and decreased expression of C/EBPalpha. The fusion protein AML1-ETO suppresses C/EBPalpha transcription via disturbed autoregulation. Chromosomal translocations involving the immunoglobin H locus and the CEBPA gene (t14;19) occur in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and have been described to induce aberrant C/EBPalpha expression in lymphoid cells. Other translocations which are associated with AML (AML1/MDS/Evi1 and CBFB/SMMHC) or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; BCR-ABL) have been demonstrated to increase the expression of specific RNA binding proteins which can block proper C/EBPalpha translation from an intact mRNA. In addition, posttranslational modifications such as Serine-21 phosphorylation by oncogenic Flt3-ITD as well as impairment of C/EBPalpha DNA binding by PLZF-RAR results in dysfunction of C/EBPalpha and a block of granulocytic differentiation. Finally, C/EBPalpha protein degradation is induced by Trib2 whose expression is increased by Notch1 mutations in AML. CBFB, core-binding factor beta; BP, RNA-binding protein; UPD, uniparental disomy.
Train_Line_4232 Among the 76 remaining patients, only one had a PTPN11 mutation (missense mutation: D61N).
Train_Line_4233 Thus, with regard to the allele burden, RARS-T differs from true ET, which reportedly never or rarely harbors the mutation in a homozygous status.
Train_Line_4234 Mutations in genes which affect histone posttranslational modifications: ASXL1 and other Polycomb-group genes.

Train_Line_4236 We evaluated the impact of ASXL1 mutations in patient subgroups treated either with ATG, lenalidomide, or thalidomide.
Train_Line_4237 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_4238 There were not significant differences in ET-related events between the two arms.
Train_Line_4239 However, MLL abnormalities are not present in MPNs, thus it was initially believed that mutations in epigenetic modifiers were a transformative event seen in MPN patients who progress to AML, and not in patients with chronic phase MPN.
Train_Line_4240 Our data support the idea that BCOR mutations associate preferentially with a group of molecular aberrations including RUNX1 and DNMT3A mutations as reported in AML.
Train_Line_4241 BCOR and BCORL1 mutations were found in 4.2% and 0.8% of MDS patients, respectively, and 2 patients presented with concomitant inactivating mutations of BCOR and BCORL1.
Train_Line_4242 Statistical analysis.
Train_Line_4243 For patients from the Asian cohort, SureSelct-captured gene targets, including BCOR and the above-mentioned genes, were analyzed for gene mutations on HiSequation 2000 at the mean depth of 415, followed by mutation calling (supplemental Methods).
Train_Line_4244 Preclinical studies show efficacy both alone and in combination with JAK2 inhibitors.
Train_Line_4245 In contrast to previous reports, we have identified a mutant MPL receptor that results in constitutive activation of downstream signal transduction pathways.
Train_Line_4246 Cytogenetics and single nucleotide polymorphism-array analyses.
Train_Line_4247 Like TET2, the most commonly affected gene in MDS, several others, such as ASXL1, EZH2, and DNMT3A, are involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription.
Train_Line_4248 After 24 h, the cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate with protease inhibitor (complete Mini EDTA free protease inhibitor tablets, Roche Diagnostics)).
Train_Line_4249 In that study, TP53 abnormalities remained the most important negative prognostic factor, as was found previously in the German CLL Study Group CLL4 trial.
Train_Line_4250 Meanwhile, considerable progress is being made on identifying pathways that act synergistically with KIT to transform cells.
Train_Line_4251 Due to the small sample size, the impact of somatic deletion of chromosome X on BRCC3 expression could not be resolved (Online Supplementary Figure S1).
Train_Line_4252 For most markers, a commonly used criterion is 20% or more of leukemic cells expressing the marker, whereas for selected markers (eg, cytoplasmic CD3, MPO, TdT, CD34, CD117) a lower cutoff has been applied (10%).
Train_Line_4253 Hollink et al reported a high incidence (22%) of WT1 mutations in pediatric CN-AML patients, a finding compatible with the close association of WT1 mutation with younger age (and current study).
Train_Line_4254 Although there were no significant differences in patients between the groups with respect to age and sex, TP53 mutations correlated strongly with lower haemoglobin, low platelet count, int-2/high risk IPSS score, complex cytogenetics, higher blast count, transfusion dependency and an increased likelihood of leukaemic progression.
Train_Line_4255 Progression to AML was defined according to the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_4256 Treatment of the cells with the small molecule Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG led to degradation of KIT, inhibition of its signalling and promoted cell death.
Train_Line_4257 Pairwise comparisons were performed by Mann-Whitney test or the Student t test for continuous variables and by 2-sided X2 tests for categorical variables and are provided for exploratory purposes.
Train_Line_4258 Somatic mutations of U2AF1 have been reported in various MDS subtypes and found to be predictive of a high risk of leukemic evolution and shorter survival.
Train_Line_4259 RFS endpoints, measured from the date of documented CR, were relapse (failure), death in CR (failure), and alive in CR at last follow-up (censored).
Train_Line_4260 Time to AML progression was measured from date of first sample collection to the time of AML diagnosis.
Train_Line_4261 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders.
Train_Line_4262 In patients with intermediate-risk AML who had mutant FLT3-ITD, we found that CEBPA mutations were associated with an improved outcome and that trisomy 8 and TET2, DNMT3A, and MLL-PTD mutations were associated with an adverse outcome.
Train_Line_4263 The recurrent flaw in data interpretation, when it comes to examining the relationship between leukemic drugs and leukemic transformation, is best illustrated by the largest prospective/retrospective study, to date, in PV (n = 1,638).
Train_Line_4264 Recent data suggest delays in initiating therapy may not be harmful in older patients, thus allowing individualized approaches.
Train_Line_4265 Of the 67 patients in the poor risk IPSS cytogenetics, 40 had CK with either 5, 7 or 17 aberrations, 20 had isolated chromosome 7 [either -7 or del7(q)] and 7 had CK without 5, 7 or 17 anomalies; significantly, only patients with CK with either 5, 7 or 17 aberrations had TP53 mutations (22/40, 55%) compared to none in patients with -7/del7q (0/27, 0%) and CK without 5, 7 or 17 anomalies (0/7, 0%) (P < 0.001) (Fig 1B).
Train_Line_4266 If the analysis was restricted to the 362 MDS patients based on the 2008 WHO classification, those with ASXL1 mutation also had a significant higher incidence of acute leukemia transformation (32.5% vs 13.0%; P<0.001) than those without the mutation.
Train_Line_4267 The additional rationale for inclusion of such a distinctive molecular mutation is also the distinct paucity of other genetic and epigenetic factor mutations, especially spliceosome component mutations in this subgroup of patients.
Train_Line_4268 The risk of teratogenicity is highest during weeks 2 to 8 after conception, the period of organogenesis.
Train_Line_4269 Our data also indicate that Gli-1, a transcriptional effector of the sonic hedgehog pathway, is highly active only in C/EBPalpha-deleted pulmonary cells that might represent the cells of origin of the lung adenocarcinomas found in our murine models.
Train_Line_4270 Importantly, some of these markers have clinical implications as far as transplant indications and the use of targeted therapy are concerned.
Train_Line_4271 Somatic mutations of DDX41 affected the ATP binding domain (Figure 2A).
Train_Line_4272 Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to determine the cellular localization of nonmutated and type 1-mutant CALR.
Train_Line_4273 Mutation analysis was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_4274 The downregulation and inactivation of C/EBPalpha might be a required step in the development of several other tumor types indicating a wider role for C/EBPalpha as a tumor suppressor.
Train_Line_4275 Whole-exome capture was accomplished based on liquid phase hybridization of sonicated genomic DNA having 150 to 200 bp of mean length to the bait complementary RNA library synthesized on magnetic beads (SureSelect, SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb; Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Train_Line_4276 The mutations in 2 patients (nos. 2 and 20) were double heterozygous with 2 exon 7 mutations in different alleles.
Train_Line_4277 Since hematopoietic cells that are homozygous for JAK2 V617F are absent in most cases of ET, this finding further suggests that RARS-T does not just represent a variant form of ET and should be distinguished from the category ET-RS.
Train_Line_4278 Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by the institutional review boards (Cleveland Clinic, Ethik-Kommission der Arztekammer Westfalen-Lippe und der medizinischen Fakultat der Westfalischen Wilhelms Universitat Munster, and University of Chicago) and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_4279 Treatment details for the French cohort were previously reported and are summarized in supplemental Table 1.
Train_Line_4280 Estimates of CIR were calculated, and Gray's k-sample test was used to evaluate differences in relapse rates for the following variables: RAS mutation, age, sex, race, hemoglobin, platelets, WBC count, percentage of blood blasts, percentage of bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic group (CBF AML v non-CBF AML), spleen involvement, liver involvement, and consolidation treatment (LDAC v HDAC).
Train_Line_4281 However, these studies have had conflicting results and modest numbers of patients with limited genetic characterization beyond TET2 mutations, limiting conclusions from these studies.
Train_Line_4282 Mutation analyses of other 15 relevant molecular genes, including class I mutations, such as FLT3/ITD, NRAS, KRAS and JAK2 mutations, and class II mutations, such as MLL/PTD, RUNX1 and WT1 mutations, as well as mutations of genes involving in epigenetic modifications, such as IDH1, IDH2, including R140 and R172 mutations, DNMT3A and EZH2 mutations, splicing machinery mutations, such as U2AF1, SRSF2 and SF3B1 mutations, and SETBP1 mutation, were performed as previously described.
Train_Line_4283 Assuming that mutation status did not change with time, we performed survival analyses using the date of the initial diagnosis as the start of follow-up.
Train_Line_4284 However, no significant differences existed in the hemograms, other karyotypes, or genders between patients with and without U2AF1 mutation.
Train_Line_4285 Cytogenetic analysis was performed by G- and R-banding analysis.
Train_Line_4286 The mechanisms of how different mutations in the same splicing pathway can have differing prognostic effects are unknown and need to be studied functionally.
Train_Line_4287 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show an age-related pattern of U2AF1 mutation (Fig. 1).
Train_Line_4288 Our present study confirms the high prevalence of mutations affecting splicing activity in this heterogeneous disorder.
Train_Line_4289 Patients with the SF3B1 mutation showed a significantly better EFS compared with those without the SF3B1 mutation in both univariate (HR = 0.33, 95% CI, 0.19-0.62, P < .001) and multivariate analysis, adjusted for demographic and hematologic variables (HR = 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.82, P = .019; Figure 3C).
Train_Line_4290 From November 1995 to March 2007, a total of 470 adult patients 15 years of age or older who were newly diagnosed as having de novo non-M3 AML at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and had cryopreserved bone marrow samples for genetic studies were enrolled.
Train_Line_4291 The w2-test was performed to calculate the significance of association between ASXL1 mutation and other parameters, including sex, the FAB subtypes, the 2008 WHO classification, karyotypes, international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) score, revised IPSS (IPSS-R) score and mutations of other genes.
Train_Line_4292 The evidence for busulfan leukemogenicity in the context of treatment for PV or ET is equally weak and inappropriately extrapolated from older patients with advanced phase disease and exposed to multiple cytoreductive drugs.
Train_Line_4293 For example, AMLs with t(8;21) frequently express the lymphoid markers CD19 or, to a lesser extent, CD7; they may also express CD5612; AMLs with inv(16) frequently express the T lineage-associated marker CD214; and AMLs with NPM1 mutation typically have high CD33 but absent or low CD34 expression.
Train_Line_4294 Cytologic evaluation revealed a higher proportion of dysmorphic features in the erythroid lineage (94% vs 65%, P = .001), whereas multilineage dysplasia, dysgranulopoiesis, and dysmegakaryopoiesis were less often observed (Table 1).
Train_Line_4295 B2M was used as a housekeeping gene for normalization (primers 5'-ATTTGGGTCGCGGTTCTTG-3' and 5'-TGCCTTGACATTCTCGATGGT-3').
Train_Line_4296 When the phasing between the basic domain and leucine zipper is altered by nucleotide insertions or deletions as described below in cases of C/EBPalpha mutations in AML, DNA-binding is altered or eliminated.
Train_Line_4297 Inhibition of deregulated transcriptional activity has, with the exception of the use of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in APL, proved to be a less tractable pharmacologic goal compared with inhibition of constitutive tyrosine kinase activity.
Train_Line_4298 Additionally, patients with DNMT3A mutations were more likely to have mutations in NPM1 and IDH1 with a trend toward a higher FLT3 mutation rate.
Train_Line_4299 In univariate analysis IPSS score (high/int-2 versus low/int-1; HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.28-3.74; P=0.003), transfusion dependence (dependent versus independent; HR 3.62; 95% CI 1.65-7.93; P=0.001) and karyotype (high versus intermediate versus low risk; HR 1.91; 95%CI 1.44-2.52; P<0.001) were also identified as prognostic factors for overall survival.
Train_Line_4300 Unfortunately only few functional studies linking the various mutant genes to a cellular or disease phenotype have been performed.
Train_Line_4301 The most frequently documented mutations affect splice genes U2AF35, ZRSR2, SRSF2, and SF3B1.
Train_Line_4302 Whether the suggested higher transformation rate is because of U2AF35 mutations or confounded by the presence of an ASXL1 mutation, which was consistently shown to be associated with worse OS and higher AML transformation rates in myeloid malignancies, must be verified in even larger cohorts of MDS patients.
Train_Line_4303 Thus, chromosomal aberrations will likely continue to have clinical relevance in MDS even in the era of genomic medicine.
Train_Line_4304 Retrospective studies show that patients who achieve second CR and proceed to autologous HSCT have a probability of long-term survival in the range of 20% to 50%.
Train_Line_4305 Mutated forms of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT are "drivers" in several cancers and are attractive targets for therapy.
Train_Line_4306 In MPNs, ASXL1 mutations are found with the same frequency in JAK2V617F and JAK2 wildtype cases.
Train_Line_4307 In a second family, identical twin brothers developed MDS (refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia [RCMD]), and AML was observed in their father.
Train_Line_4308 CONCLUSION.
Train_Line_4309 The comparison of clinical and hematologic characteristics of patients with and without mutation of ASXL1 is shown in Table 1.
Train_Line_4310 These observations suggest opposing functions of C/EBPalpha dysregulation in myeloid and lymphoid leukemogenesis, with C/EBPalpha serving as an oncogene in BPALL.
Train_Line_4311 From these data no clear recommendation can be given.
Train_Line_4312 Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse death and relapse with or without death was calculated using competing risks from time of HSCT to relapse and nonrelapse death and compared using the Gray test.
Train_Line_4313 The removal of these 2 types of introns is catalyzed by 2 different spliceosomes called the U2- and U12-dependent spliceosomes, respectively.
Train_Line_4314 This may be due a change of the ratio of p30 and p42 homo- and heterodimers.
Train_Line_4315 In addition, acetylcholinesterase staining demonstrated MPLW515L megakaryocyte colonies (Figure 6B, left picture) that were significantly larger than MPLWT megakaryocyte colonies (Figure 6B, right picture).
Train_Line_4316 Clinical profiles of these patients were reviewed, and the diagnosis was confirmed by the overwhelming percentage of erythroblasts (> 50% of total nucleated cells) in bone marrow aspirate smears and/or the expression of glycophorin-A on blast cells.
Train_Line_4317 I manage, pregnant patients or women of child-bearing potential, in the same general manner and I do not use platelet-lowering agents or heparin therapy in the setting of low-risk disease.
Train_Line_4318 Together with the fact that C/EBPalphamutant AML patients also retain expression of p30 C/EBPalpha, these data suggest that residual expression is required for commitment of HSC toward the myeloid lineage and for the development of AML similar to how AML develops in PU.1-hypomorphic but not PU.1 knockout mice.
Train_Line_4319 Tracing TET2 mutations through differentiation.
Train_Line_4320 The pathogenetic consequences of SOCS3 methylation for IMF, therefore, remain to be fully investigated.
Train_Line_4321 International prognosis scoring system: low, 0; intermediate (INT)-1, 0.5-1; INT-2, 1.5-2; and high, >= 2.5.
Train_Line_4322 All novel variants were verified using PCR-based Sanger sequencing.
Train_Line_4323 Mutation status of SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 in MDS patients.
Train_Line_4324 An interaction term evaluating the differential effect of HDAC by RAS mutational status was included in the final multivariable CIR model and in the resultant adjusted CIR plots, supporting the primary hypothesis of the study.
Train_Line_4325 Myelodysplasia driver genes are recurrently mutated also in other myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_4326 Study eligibility criteria included availability of peripheral blood (PB) smear, BM histology, and cytogenetic information at time of referral to the Mayo Clinic.
Train_Line_4327 NA, not applicable.
Train_Line_4328 We observed a global loss of H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) in leukemic blasts with mutations in SETD2.
Train_Line_4329 Notably, all three spliceosome mutations were mutually exclusive.
Train_Line_4330 Suppression of Protein Translation.
Train_Line_4331 Treatment with aspirin did not increase the incidence of major bleeding and instead reduced the risk of combined endpoints for "nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes" and "nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from cardiovascular causes."
Train_Line_4332 However, the association of ASXL1 mutation with other genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of MDS and their dynamic changes during disease progression remain unclear.
Train_Line_4333 The p.W262R (c.784T>C) was detected in all 42 patients as a homozygote, was also known polymorphism (rs3184504).
Train_Line_4334 Deregulation of the TP53 pathway has been shown secondary to mutations of TP53, increased expression of the TP53 inhibitor HDM-2, or epigenetic silencing of the TP53 promoter.
Train_Line_4335 The clinical characteristics of the patients we studied, as compared with the complete E1900 trial cohort, are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Train_Line_4336 Often myeloid sarcomas have myelomonocytic or monoblastic morphology.
Train_Line_4337 By contrast, the diagnosis of MDS may be difficult in patients with a normal karyotype or noninformative cytogenetics.
Train_Line_4338 As the sole abnormality.
Train_Line_4339 Although JAK2 is targeted by SOCS1 leading to reduced phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5, it is not clear whether STAT5A or STAT5B transcriptionally activate SOCS1 directly.
Train_Line_4340 The 52-bp deletions (type 1) eliminate almost all negatively charged amino acids, whereas the 5-bp insertions (type 2) retain approximately half the negatively charged amino acids (Fig. 2C).
Train_Line_4341 Little is known about the pathogenesis of CK-AML, but the high frequency of TP53 alteration, and in particular biallelic alteration, suggests an important role of p53 in leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_4342 During a recent international study of over 1,000 patients with ET, the prognostically detrimental effect (on survival, leukemic transformation, and fibrotic progression) of prefibrotic morphology was demonstrated and the study also identified age >60 years, leukocyte count >11 x 109 /L, anemia, and thrombosis history as additional independent risk factors for survival.
Train_Line_4343 The primers used for exon 7 were FAM-5'-ttactctctgcctgcaggatgtgcgac-3' and 5'-agcgggcacacttaccagt-3', and those for exon 9 were VIC-5'-gccgaggctagaccttctct-3' and 5'-tccaatccctctcatcacaa-3', which would produce amplicons with sizes of 183 bp and 203 bp, respectively, for wild-type WT1.
Train_Line_4344 Additional analyses are warranted to clarify the role of allogeneic transplantation in DNMT3A-mutated patients.
Train_Line_4345 Mutant JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) is inhibited by WT SH2B3 (Tong et al 2005; Gery et al 2009).
Train_Line_4346 In haemopoietic cell line models and CBF AML patients the serine/threonine protein phosphatase PP2A, a known tumour suppressor, is strikingly down-regulated.
Train_Line_4347 Therefore, loss-of-function mutations of SETD2 may impair the chromatin recruitment of SETD2 mediated by the SRI domain, which in turn contributes to the global loss of H3K36me3.
Train_Line_4348 EMSAs were performed using a modified protocol from a previous study and visualized using a Chemiluminescent Nucleic Acid Detection Module (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Train_Line_4349 GENES INVOLVED IN LEUKEMIC PROGRESSION.
Train_Line_4350 SF3B1 mutations were enriched in CD38-positive patients.
Train_Line_4351 Chromosomal abnormalities were described accordingto the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.
Train_Line_4352 In these cells, C/EBPalpha directly activates transcription from lineage-specific gene promoters (ie, serum albumin, AP2 and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor, or surfactant proteins and CC10).
Train_Line_4353 PKC412 is a multi-targeted staurosporin analogue which has been evaluated as a FLT3 inhibitor in AML.
Train_Line_4354 The transfusion dependence rate was significantly lower for SRSF2-mut patients than for SRSF2-wt patients (20% vs 44% in SRSF2-wt patients; P = .036).
Train_Line_4355 As shown in Figure 1b and c, p.Thr354Met is situated between the deleted residues (p.Ala341_Gly346del), as is also observed in CML blast crisis, and the Leu359 residue.
Train_Line_4356 UPN1 had two TP53 mutations at contrasting allele burdens (54 and 9% respectively), indicative of two disease clones and SNP-A detected CN-LOH confirming the homozygous mutation.
Train_Line_4357 The overall scenario is similar in PV and concerns about drug leukemogenicity involving hydroxyurea or busulfan are largely based on anecdotes rather than properly executed controlled studies.
Train_Line_4358 ASXL1 codes for a nuclear protein of 1084 residues characterized by an N-terminal helix-turn-helix domain, HARE-HTH, and an unusual C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD), which may bind methylated lysines (Figure 1).
Train_Line_4359 With 12.9 years median follow-up, the 10-year CIR was similar for mutRAS and wtRAS patients (65% v 73%; P = .31).
Train_Line_4360 Differences among variables were evaluated by the v2 test and Mann-Whitney U test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
Train_Line_4361 Thus, these patients often deserve being offered the option of standard chemotherapy.
Train_Line_4362 Aberrations were detected in 15 RA/RCMD, 1 RARS, 12 RAEB-I/II, 3 CMML-I/II, 6 sAML, and 4 MDS/MPN-U patients.
Train_Line_4363 Despite infrequent mutations, BCOR analyses should be considered in risk stratification.
Train_Line_4364 SH2B3 directly binds to wild type (WT) JAK2 and JAK2 V617F, and decreases their autophosphorylation and downstream signalling through STAT5, MAPK/ERK and the PI3K/AKT pathways (Tong et al 2005; Bersenev et al 2008; Gery et al 2009).
Train_Line_4365 These variants were validated by PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing of the same leukemic and nonleukemic genomic DNA, and corresponded to 11 distinct genes, including SPATA16, DSP, DNMT3A, SFRS11, CDH12, SSRP1, BCOR, YY2, TCEB3B, ZNF676, and RSPH10B2 (Table 1).
Train_Line_4366 In several MPN patients, the coexistence of 2 oncogenic events, such as JAK2V617F, MPLW515L, JAK2 exon 12, BCR-ABL, and c-CBL mutants, has been demonstrated.
Train_Line_4367 Table 2. Details of BCOR-disruptive mutations observed in AML patients.
Train_Line_4368 Similar to AML, genetic aberrations appear to play an important role for the pathogenesis of MDS.
Train_Line_4369 Further limiting this cohort to 82 patients with wild-type status for NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, and MLL-PTD, a trend remained toward an inferior survival in BCOR-mutated patients compared with BCOR wild-type patients (n = 14 vs n = 68; alive at 2 years, 16.5% vs 57.1%; P = .111), and a worse event-free survival (n = 14 vs n = 68; event-free survival at 2 years, 0% vs 43.8%; P = .068).
Train_Line_4370 Mutations of other genes associated with poor prognosis in prior studies, such as RUNX1, ASXL1, SRSF2, and U2AF1, were not associated with differences in OS in our cohort of patients who underwent HSCT (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_4371 Thus, in general, patients with such favorable-risk AML are not considered candidates for allogeneic HSCT, unless they have a very low transplant risk or new transplant strategies (eg, RIC HSCT) are evaluated within a clinical trial.
Train_Line_4372 In addition, L3MBTL1, a polycomb gene, may be one of the important lost genes in chromosome 20q deletion frequently seen in MPN.
Train_Line_4373 A total of 355 patients with a median age of 64 years (range, 17-96 years) were identified between 2 hematology centers (Kings College Hospital, London, United Kingdom, and Haematologie, Onkologie und Klinische Immunologie, Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany).
Train_Line_4374 Thus, as with BCR-ABL in CML, a single mutation in a signaling protein would be at the origin of classic MPNs.
Train_Line_4375 In our prior report, SRSF2 mutation, another spliceosome machinery gene mutation, occurred dominantly in older patients and was associated with male gender and mutations of RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1.
Train_Line_4376 Among the 110 patients who had no WT1 mutation at diagnosis, 3 acquired WT1 mutation at relapse (Table 5).
Train_Line_4377 Results.
Train_Line_4378 TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_4379 Tumor DNAs were extracted from patients' bone marrow cells.
Train_Line_4380 It will be of paramount importance to determine if one of the mutant clones showed clonal dominance over the other on disease progression or evolution to leukaemia.
Train_Line_4381 Recent studies of the spectrum of somatic genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have identified frequent somatic mutations in genes that encode proteins important in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription.
Train_Line_4382 This myeloproliferation results from the absence of feedback regulation by mature cells, decreasing cytokine levels.
Train_Line_4383 Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to dissect the impacts of individual prognostic factors on OS and TTL.
Train_Line_4384 FLT3 plays a crucial role in normal hematopoiesis and cellular growth in primitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.
Train_Line_4385 No difference was observed for JAK2 V617F-positive patients (data not shown).
Train_Line_4386 Indeed, in published studies (Table 1), only 1% of CMML, 3.5% of AML and 7% of RAEB-T had somatic mutations of PTPN11.
Train_Line_4387 Mutations in U2AF1 had no impact on OS (HR = 1.49; 95% CI, 0.54-4.1; P = .44; Figure 2C), but showed a trend toward a more rapid transformation to AML (HR = 2.53; 95% CI, 0.9-7.13; P = .079; Figure 2D and Table 3).
Train_Line_4388 Furthermore, resistance frequently develops due to secondary mutations.
Train_Line_4389 The study design adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_4390 In other words, exposure to alkylating agents other than hydroxyurea probably selects patients who are at a higher risk of leukemic transformation because of older age, longer disease duration and intrinsic aggressive disease biology.
Train_Line_4391 NF1 deletions were mainly found in myelofibrosis and rarely in PV or ET.
Train_Line_4392 C/EBPalpha expression is lost more commonly in squamous cell cancers, and there is a trend toward a higher frequency of loss in poorly differentiated and more advanced cancers, suggesting the biologic role of C/EBPalpha in differentiation and tumor progression, but no prognostic role for C/EBPalpha expression was found.
Train_Line_4393 Epidermal-specific C/EBPalpha-knockout mice survive and display no detectable abnormalities in epidermal keratinocyte proliferation.
Train_Line_4394 There is a paucity of prospective treatment data because patients with t-AML have often been excluded from frontline clinical trials.
Train_Line_4395 In the adult lung, C/EBPalpha is expressed in both bronchial epithelial Clara cells as well as type II alveolar cells.
Train_Line_4396 However, given the heterogeneity of the disease it is of major importance to characterize MDS patients better at the molecular level, and to evaluate the prognostic relevance of new mutations.
Train_Line_4397 TP53-altered CK-AMLs were also associated with specific abnormalities.
Train_Line_4398 The number of colonic polyps that occur in compound Dnmt1 heterozygous knock-out/Apcmin mice is reduced, while T-cell lymphomas are increased in mice carrying a Dnmt1 hypomorphic allele (~10% normal levels).
Train_Line_4399 Among patients with IDH1 mutations, two (25%) were IDH1 R132C mutant, whereas the remainder was IDH1 R132S mutant.
Train_Line_4400 PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS.
Train_Line_4401 MDS driver genes are also frequently mutated in other myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_4402 Cytogenetics.
Train_Line_4403 However, because of the low frequency of BCOR disruptive mutations and the relatively low number of patients analyzed for each cytogenetic category, a definitive picture of the frequency of such mutations among the entire spectrum of AML genotypes will require the study of additional patients.
Train_Line_4404 For this subset of older patients, CR rates are 30% or less, and OS is less than 5%.
Train_Line_4405 Global methylation of CpG islands was assessed using the Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) in bone marrow samples from randomly selected patients with DNMT3A mutated (n = 15) or wild-type AML (n = 17) and in peripheral-blood samples from healthy volunteers (n = 10).

Train_Line_4407 Here, we report the frequency of DNMT3A mutations in patients with de novo MDS, and their association with secondary AML.
Train_Line_4408 Studies by Metzeler et al and Schnittger et al indicate that ASXL1 mutations are 4 to 5 times more likely in AML patients >60 years of age compared with those from 16 to 60 years of age.
Train_Line_4409 Abbreviations: S/P HSCT, status post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; S/P C/T, CR, status post chemotherapy, in complete remission.
Train_Line_4410 With the possible exception of trisomy 22 in AML with inv(16) or t(16;16) that has been associated with an improved relapse-free survival (RFS), no such impact has been shown for other secondary cytogenetic changes.
Train_Line_4411 Expert opinion.
Train_Line_4412 In AML male patients, BCOR mutations disrupted the single copy of the gene.
Train_Line_4413 When necessary, such as in the analyses performed in various subsets, the results of the univariate analyses were used to select the variables to be included in the forward variable search.
Train_Line_4414 Lastly, a number of studies integrating mutational analysis with clinical outcome in the setting of prospective clinical trials in AML have identified mutations as markers of prognostic risk stratification in AML.
Train_Line_4415 In multivariate analysis, SRSF2 remained an independent poor risk marker for overall survival (hazard ratio = 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.28-4.13; P = .017) and acute myeloid leukemia progression (hazard ratio = 2.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-6.12; P = .008).
Train_Line_4416 All patients signed informed consents for sample collection in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_4417 The presence of cardiovascular risk factors is currently not taken under consideration during formal risk categorization.
Train_Line_4418 C/EBPalpha As a Master Regulator of Hematopoietic Differentiation.
Train_Line_4419 Molecular Determinants of Overall Survival.
Train_Line_4420 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_4421 An important feature of MDS is the increased frequency of UPD, which is an indirect measure of genomic instability.
Train_Line_4422 The PH domain of LNK is involved in the colocalization of LNK to the plasma membrane.
Train_Line_4423 Forced expression of oncogenic Ras leads to downregulation of C/EBPalpha in immortalized keratinocytes, and C/EBPalpha expression leads to G1 cell cycle arrest in squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.
Train_Line_4424 However, the use of growth factors does not translate into a survival benefit.
Train_Line_4425 A departmental database was used to identify patients with WHO classification MDS or CMML who had documented FLT3 mutation (either ITD or TKD) at diagnosis.
Train_Line_4426 Statistical Methods.
Train_Line_4427 In fact, overexpression of a Dnmt3a isoform (Dnmt3a1) was recently shown to increase penetrance and reduce latency of PML/RARA-initiated myeloid leukemia in a murine transplantation model.
Train_Line_4428 Student t test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables and medians of distributions, such as age and hemograms.
Train_Line_4429 However, among patients with spliceosome mutations, TP53 aberrations were observed exclusively in those who had mutations in spliceosome component U2AF1 (20 vs. 0%, P < 0.01).
Train_Line_4430 In addition to age and IPSS risk group, mutations of EZH2, NRAS, and ASXL1 were each independently associated with a higher risk of death in this model.
Train_Line_4431 Abbreviations: IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; IPSS, International Prognostic Scoring System; IPSS-R, revised IPSS; NS, not significant; WHO, World Health Organization.
Train_Line_4432 This suggests that mutant Idh1 actually results in an age-dependent blockade of hematopoietic differentiation.
Train_Line_4433 In one case it has been demonstrated that the MPLW515L and JAK2V617F subclones were derived from the same ancestral TET2-mutated clone.
Train_Line_4434 Sequential studies of WT1 mutations in AML patients.
Train_Line_4435 However, we observed that in absence of iron deficiency the erythrocyte counts were significantly higher and the MCV lower in the JAK2V617F positive group compared to in patients with wild type JAK2.
Train_Line_4436 We demonstrated previously that RARS-T may develop from RARS through the acquisition of somatic mutations of JAK2, MPL, or other, as-yet-unknown genes.
Train_Line_4437 SOCS1 not only regulates cytokine signaling but may also be implicated in direct activation of p53-dependent senescence.

Train_Line_4444 Five patients harbored a frameshift mutation in codon P95 and 1 patient showed a heterozygous point mutation in codon P96 leading to a change from proline to leucine.
Train_Line_4445 These figures were well within the baseline risk that is intrinsic to the diseases and no different than those seen with hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_4446 The correlations of SRSF2 mutation with the patients' clinical features are summarized in Table 1.
Train_Line_4447 Preliminary results show that in the mouse, in vitro knockdown of TET2 by shRNAs increases monocytic differentiation in the presence of GM-CSF, causing an excess of immature forms.
Train_Line_4448 Relevant clinical details are also shown for each patient, who are referred to by a unique patient code (UPC).
Train_Line_4449 As above, mutation of either residue is expected to favour kinase activation.
Train_Line_4450 Myeloid sarcomas have been associated with hyperleukocytosis, t(8;21), and CD56 positivity.
Train_Line_4451 In addition to mutant-specific small-molecule inhibitors of IDH1 and IDH2, there may be therapeutic potential in inhibiting production of glutamine, the essential source of a-KG, by small-molecule inhibiting of the enzyme glutaminase.
Train_Line_4452 Because the exact cause of death can be difficult to discern, we performed a planned landmark analysis with patients surviving to day 100.
Train_Line_4453 The pcDNA3.1 WT JAK2 and CBL vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Z.J. Zhao (University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK; Zhao et al 2005) and Dr. H. Serve (University Hospital Manster, Manster, Germany; u u Sargin et al 2007), respectively.
Train_Line_4454 To inhibit D816 mutants, a drug needs to bind to the active conformation of the kinase which is more structurally constrained than the inactive conformation to which drugs like imatinib and sunitinib bind.
Train_Line_4455 Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 109/L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding.
Train_Line_4456 After PCR, the products were sized on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.
Train_Line_4457 Genotyping Version 2.0 console (Affymetrix) was used for analysis of 6.0 arrays.
Train_Line_4458 Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications and not necessarily survival or risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation (Table IV).
Train_Line_4459 All 16 patients demonstrating SOCS3 promoter methylation were classified as having IMF suggesting that SOCS3 methylation is not merely a reflection of myelofibrotic transformation of a previously unrecognised MPD.
Train_Line_4460 Abbreviations: UPN, unique patient number; RA, refractory anemia; RARS, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; RAEB, refractory anemia with excess blasts; RAEBT, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; CR, complete remission; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; ND, no data.
Train_Line_4461 Our current understanding of the spectrum of somatic genetic alterations in AML has already outpaced the range of therapeutic approaches currently available for the treatment of patients with AML.
Train_Line_4462 The power of SNP genotyping as a tool for gene discovery is shown by several recent studies.
Train_Line_4463 RARS associated with SF3B1 mutation represents an illustrative example of gain of function at the hematopoietic stem cell level combined with loss of function (excessive apoptosis of immature red cells) at the hematopoietic precursor level.
Train_Line_4464 In addition, there was no significant difference in the treatment modalities received by TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients.
Train_Line_4465 Application of combination therapies during initial disease treatment should lead to optimum tumour clearance and correspondingly reduce the problem of drug-resistant relapse.
Train_Line_4466 In the current study, we examined the phenotypic and prognostic effects of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations among 277 patients with MDS, in the context of the recently revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) and other previously acknowledged risk factors.
Train_Line_4467 This suggests that additional mutant gene(s) may be involved in the pathogenesis of ring sideroblasts in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_4468 In this regard, it makes more sense to pursue a more specific JAK2 inhibitor, such as SAR302503, rather than a less specific JAK1/2 inhibitor, such as ruxolitinib or CYT387.
Train_Line_4469 Postremission therapy with repetitive cycles of HiDAC (3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 3, and 5) is considered a reasonable choice for younger adult patients with CBF AML, and also for AML with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD and with mutated CEBPA.
Train_Line_4470 Bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained from 318 consecutive adult MDS patients seen at Kings College Hospital between June 2004 and June 2010 and who had provided written informed consent in accordance to National Research Ethics Protocol (KCLPR060 PR015).
Train_Line_4471 The median allele burden of TP53 mutation was 52.9% (range 2.5-93%).
Train_Line_4472 Mutation status of IDH1/2 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_4473 Two genes involved in chromatin modification and regulation are recurrently mutated in MDS: ASXL1, which interacts with the polycomb-group repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1, PRC2), and EZH2, which belongs to PRC2.
Train_Line_4474 METHODS.
Train_Line_4475 There have thus far been 2 studies evaluating the in vivo function of Asxl1 in hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_4476 Likewise, there was no significant difference in OS between patients based on the presence of single or multiple mutations, even when all the variants initially identified (82 variants) were included in the analysis (65 patients; P = .15).
Train_Line_4477 BM cells were infected on 2 consecutive days on RetroNectinTM-coated dishes, following the manufacturer's instructions (Takara Shuzo Co., Otsu, Japan).
Train_Line_4478 Also, the reports on SRSF2 mutations are conflicting.
Train_Line_4479 Germline mutations of C/EBPalpha have been described and are typically N-terminal mutations that are then joined by a somatic C-terminal mutation on the other allele.
Train_Line_4480 There is also uncontrolled evidence that supports phlebotomy for all patients with PV and two recent studies suggested a hematocrit target of either <55% or <48% as being acceptable in patients receiving aspirin therapy.
Train_Line_4481 A landmark study performed by Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) showed that 4 cycles of HiDAC (3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 3, and 5) are superior to 4 courses of intermediate- (400 mg/m2 continuous IV on days 1-5) or standarddose (100 mg/m2 continuous IV on days 1-5) cytarabine; patients were scheduled to also receive 4 courses of monthly maintenance treatment.
Train_Line_4482 Cytogenetic data were available in 446 patients among total cohort including 21 patients with IDH mutation and 425 without the mutation.
Train_Line_4483 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, bone marrow failure, a propensity for progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a variety of molecular abnormalities, including chromosomal aberrations and somatic mutations.
Train_Line_4484 These studies on unselected patients failed to demonstrate significant benefit.
Train_Line_4485 Approximately 30% of patients carry recurrent chromosomal translocations and are grouped into a distinct AML category of the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_4486 Of the combined 120 patients with primary myelofibrosis and nonmutated JAK2 and MPL, 105 had a mutation in CALR (88%).
Train_Line_4487 Differences in conditioning regimens (myeloablative v nonmyeloablative; HR, 2.03; P = .037) and donor type (unrelated v related; HR, 2.05; P = .029) had a similar impact on OS (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_4488 Most studies concerning WT1 mutations in AML were focused on patients with normal karyotype.
Train_Line_4489 The impact of HDAC consolidation on CIR in patients with wild-type RAS was substantially less (HR = 0.67; P = .044; Table 2 and Fig 3B).
Train_Line_4490 For unmethylation-specific PCR, the primers were SOCS3-UNF1 and SOCS3-UNR2 (5'CAACCAAAACAACCAATAAACAC3', nt-1227).
Train_Line_4491 All tests were 2-tailed, and a P value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Train_Line_4492 The favorable impact of HDAC on CIR was no longer statistically significant in patients with non-CBF AML with wild-type RAS (HR = 0.71; P = .13).
Train_Line_4493 We have previously shown that WT SH2B3 inhibits Epo-dependent growth of BaF3-E cells (Gery et al 2009).
Train_Line_4494 BCOR mutations are mainly distributed in CN-AML.
Train_Line_4495 Patient 35 acquired novel WT1 mutation and karyotypic evolution at first relapse, whereas the original CEBPA mutant remained the same (Table 5).
Train_Line_4496 The statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL), R 2.14.1, or STATA v12 (STATA Corporation).
Train_Line_4497 The genetic basis for such stimulus was identified in 2005 by the discovery of the JAK2 V617F mutation.
Train_Line_4498 We identified mutations in three genes-TP53, TET2, and DNMT3A-which were each associated with shorter OS after adjustment for clinical factors associated with poor outcome after stem-cell transplantation.
Train_Line_4499 The negative prognostic effect of DNMT3A mutations was not only found in patients with CN-AML with FLT3-ITD mutations as reported previously, but also in patients with CN-AML with wild-type NPM1 and wild-type FLT3 (Data Supplement Figure S4).
Train_Line_4500 Using an established genomic analysis method, we detected large genomic deletions encompassing SETD2 in patients with MLL fusion, as well as patients with TEL (also called ETV6)-AML1 or BCR-ABL, but at a very low frequency (<=0.6%) (Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Fig. 11).
Train_Line_4501 In summary, BCOR disruptive mutations were relatively rare in unselected CN-AML patients (3.8%), whereas they accounted for a significant fraction (17.1%) of the least genetically characterized subgroup of CN-AML, those carrying no NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, or IDH1 mutations and no MLL-PTD (such as the AML index patient).
Train_Line_4502 2.1 Composition of the panel.
Train_Line_4503 For histopathology, tissues were fixed in formalin and then embedded in paraffin for histology analysis as previously described.
Train_Line_4504 Function of the ASXL1 protein.
Train_Line_4505 The mutational hot spots for SF3B1 included K700E in 10 (70%) of the 13 SF3B1-mutated patients, H662Q in 2 (15%) and K666N in 1 (8%) (Table II).
Train_Line_4506 Plates were incubated at 37--Degree--C for seven days.
Train_Line_4507 During recent years, considerable progress has been made in deciphering the molecular genetic and epigenetic basis of AML and in defining new diagnostic and prognostic markers.
Train_Line_4508 Our results show that an acquired mutation of the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL-W515L, may also be involved in the pathogenesis of RARS-T, at least in some cases.
Train_Line_4509 The size of the mutant TET2 clone, presence of multiple versus single mutations and TET2 mRNA expression levels did not affect the overall survival.
Train_Line_4510 Although more sensitive techniques can identify JAK2V617F mutations in a small proportion of clonal cells, we recently demonstrated that the majority of JAK2V617F-negative ET and MF patients have clonal granulocytes, suggesting that alternative mutation(s) result in clonal granulopoiesis in this subset of patients.
Train_Line_4511 TABLE IV. Risk Stratification in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia and Risk-Adopted Therapy.
Train_Line_4512 These data provide genetic evidence that MPLW515L is a pathogenetic mutation in this subset of JAK2V617F-negative MF.
Train_Line_4513 Better risk stratification before HSCT would allow for more accurate evaluation of potential benefit and could improve outcome in patients with MDS selected for transplantation and identify those for whom novel transplantation approaches are appropriate while preventing unnecessary transplantation in patients unlikely to benefit from the procedure.
Train_Line_4514 STATISTICAL ANALYSES.
Train_Line_4515 All analyses were performed by the CALGB Statistical Center.
Train_Line_4516 Patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia were excluded.
Train_Line_4517 Associations between BCOR mutations and clinical parameters and survival.
Train_Line_4518 Among the 49 LT, 4 had IDH1 mutations and 5 had IDH2 mutations, constituting 50% and 19% of the total number of patients with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, respectively.
Train_Line_4519 Table 1. Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System (LR-PSS).
Train_Line_4520 This has led to optimism that outcomes for MPN patients will substantially improve as we develop therapies based on insights into the genetic basis of these myeloid neoplasms.

Train_Line_4522 In contrast, mutations in the TET2 (13%) and SF3B1 (9%) genes were relatively underrepresented relative to other cohorts.
Train_Line_4523 Several groups are currently evaluating the clinical significance of SF3B1 mutations in CLL patients.
Train_Line_4524 Using massively parallel sequencing technology, we recently identified somatically acquired mutations in SF3B1, a gene encoding a core component of RNA splicing machinery, in diverse WHO categories but predominantly in MDS patients with ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_4525 Assessment of global DNA methylation levels did not reveal differential methylation of DNMT3A mutated versus wild-type patients (Data Supplement Figure S5).
Train_Line_4526 In a study of MPNs based on the DIPSS-plus score (Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System for primary myelofibrosis), ASXL1 mutation tended to be associated with an aggressive disease and a poor overall survival.
Train_Line_4527 Because they basically consist in copy number changes, their detection will likely be improved by array-based karyotyping and/or by massive parallel sequencing itself.
Train_Line_4528 RUNX1, ASXL1, STAG2, SRSF2, and CBL mutations were found with decreasing frequencies ranging from 92% to 73% of total BM cells (Figure 2, UPN3).
Train_Line_4529 There are 2 possible scenarios for these patients:
Train_Line_4530 The greatest frequency of mutations is found in CMML and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_4531 Therefore, bone marrow examination is often necessary to make an accurate morphologic diagnosis of ET and distinguish it from other myeloid neoplasms, especially from prefibrotic PMF; megakaryocytes in ET are large and mature-appearing, whereas those in prefibrotic PMF display abnormal maturation with hyperchromatic and irregularly folded nuclei.
Train_Line_4532 For a diagnosis of AML, a marrow or blood blast count of 20% or more is required, except for AML with t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), and some cases of erythroleukemia.
Train_Line_4533 The C/EBP Family of Transcription Factors.
Train_Line_4534 For example, in haemopoetic cells transformed by D816V mutant KIT, PI3K is constitutively and potently activated.
Train_Line_4535 Cell differentiation and proliferation assays.
Train_Line_4536 Given the overlap between clinical features and genetic lesions, the argument could be made that molecular abnormalities should be the principal way in which disease prognosis is determined.
Train_Line_4537 No. sc-9008; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) (1:100) was added to the nuclear lysates for 20 min before the addition of the probe to show GATA2 as the binding protein.
Train_Line_4538 EZH2 mutations are predicted to be inactivating through either the truncation of the protein or modification of essential amino acids.
Train_Line_4539 All the findings in the univariate analysis were also significant in the multivariate analysis (P<0.05, with adjustment for age, whitecell count, transplantation status [did vs. did not undergo stem-cell transplantation], and cytogenetic characteristics) (Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix), with the exception of the findings for MLL-PTD, PHF6, and ASXL1 mutations.
Train_Line_4540 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4541 Amplification conditions were 95--degrees--C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95--degrees--C for 15 s, 60--degrees--C for 1 min followed by a final dissociation cycle of 95--degrees--C for 1 min, 55--degrees--C for 30 s and 95--degrees--C for 30 s.
Train_Line_4542 A JAK2 mutation is found in 50-70% of patients with ET, myelofibrosis or RARS-T and is capable of distinguishing reactive from clonal thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_4543 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4544 Interestingly, PTPN11 mutations occurred preferentially in leukemia with a monocytic component and/or in the presence of monosomy 7.
Train_Line_4545 High abundance of mutation within the T-cell population.
Train_Line_4546 Children with this syndrome have a developmental disorder as well as a predisposition to develop juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).
Train_Line_4547 Thus, although the karyotype may be unknown at diagnosis in most centers, patients known to have adverse cytogenetics, even those with a good performance status and lacking comorbidities, may be considered for investigational therapies, or, if such therapies are unavailable, for mild cytoreductive therapy only.
Train_Line_4548 Because frameshift mutations in ASXL1 disrupt the plant-homology domain, the mutated protein may have a dominant-negative function on gene regulation.
Train_Line_4549 Some AMLs with recurrent genetic abnormalities are associated with characteristic immunophenotypic features.
Train_Line_4550 In these cases, C/EBPalpha mRNA is downregulated by the oncogene AML1-ETO by a mechanism that is still incompletely understood but appears to involve an altered self-stimulatory transcriptional loop.
Train_Line_4551 These mixtures were then electrophoresed on an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_4552 Taq polymerase-amplified cloning analysis.
Train_Line_4553 Mutation analyses were performed for ASXL1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, RUNX1, NRAS, TP53, NPM1, and SF3B1, as described previously.
Train_Line_4554 Of the 13 cases with SNP-A aberrations of 17p, 10 had TP53 mutations and 3 did not show mutation of TP53 by sequencing.
Train_Line_4555 Abbreviation: pts, patients.
Train_Line_4556 Approximately 50% of DDX41 mutant cases did not harbor additional mutations (13 cases were sequenced by WES, whereas 14 cases were sequenced by deep-targeted re-sequencing).
Train_Line_4557 The genomic regions that span exon 12 of ASXL1 as well as exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2 were amplified as previously reported.
Train_Line_4558 Altogether, these findings imply that ASXL1 mutations may have little, if any, role in the progression of MDS in ASXL1-wild patients.
Train_Line_4559 Pretreatment samples should include nucleic acid (DNA and RNA, stored at -80--Degree--C) and viable cells (stored at -196--Degree--C).
Train_Line_4560 Recently a key role for the ETS family transcription factor ETV-1 acting in synergy with mutant KIT was reported in GIST.
Train_Line_4561 Paraffin sections (4 mum) on Super Frost microscopic slides were pre-treated at 60--degrees--C for 60 min.
Train_Line_4562 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_4563 Both 14-3-3 and CBL have recently been suggested to modify the activity of SH2B3 family members (Yokouchi et al 1999; Jiang et al 2012).
Train_Line_4564 Figure 3. Molecular and morphologic findings in patient n. 244 at initial diagnosis (A-C) and in sequential biopsies 8 (D-F) and 16 (GI) months later. Characteristic chromatograms of DNA samples obtained from sequential biopsies demonstrate the increase of the allelic ratio of mutated JAK2 from 10%T to 43%T and than to 98%T (A, D, G). A moderate erythroid hyperplasia with mild megaloblastoid maturation defects and cytochemically detectable iron granules (blue) encircling the nuclei of typical ringed sideroblasts (inserts, bone marrow smears) is a common feature of the three biopsies (B, E, H; immunolabeling for hemoglobin; inserts, Perls' stain). The increase in megakaryocyte number, atypia and clustering is evident on CD61 immunostains (C, F, I).
Train_Line_4565 Briefly, each targeted exon was amplified with each pair of primers, generating 200bp fragments on average.
Train_Line_4566 In patient n. 224, we detected the MPL-W515L mutation (not shown).
Train_Line_4567 In addition, when cells with the abnormal gene were put into mice, the mice developed a blood disorder similar to that seen in humans with MF.
Train_Line_4568 MPL signals via its association with JAK2 and TYK2, resulting in phosphorylation of both MPL and JAK2/TYK2 and consequent activation of the STAT3, STAT5, ERK/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.
Train_Line_4569 ASXL1 mutations are frameshift and nonsense mutations that are supposed to result in C-terminal truncation of the protein upstream of the PHD finger (Figure 1).
Train_Line_4570 The coding exons of SF3B1 were screened using massively parallel pyrosequencing of DNA pools using the genome sequencer FLX system (Roche Diagnostics).
Train_Line_4571 After 24 h, nuclear extracts were prepared using a NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Train_Line_4572 The mutations affecting the spliceosome complex were found to be mutually exclusive in prior studies of Yoshida et al and Makishima et al.
Train_Line_4573 Figure 3. Schematic representation of our current understanding of the relationship between the occurrence of a somatic SF3B1 mutation and the formation of ring sideroblasts in patients with RARS. Previous studies found reduced expression of ABCB7 in CD34-positive cells and cultured erythroblasts from RARS patients, whereas a recent study has shown altered ABCB7 exon usage in primary RARS cells. The interconnection between DNA transcription and RNA splicing, illustrated in Figure 2, is consistent with the conclusion that a somatic SF3B1 mutation may result in reduced transcription and abnormal splicing of ABCB7.
Train_Line_4574 Whole exome sequencing and candidate gene sequencing are clearly less informative and may not allow the identification of more rarely mutated genes.
Train_Line_4575 This exon encodes the intracellular juxtamembrane domain (JMD), a key autoregulatory domain of RTKs which stabilises the inactive conformation of the kinase domain in which the "activation loop" is incorrectly positioned for catalysis.
Train_Line_4576 These data suggested the possibility that mutations in the regions of these cytokine receptors that are critical for receptor dimerization (transmembrane domain) and for JAK2 binding (juxtamembrane domain) might lead to activation of JAK-STAT signaling in JAK2V617F-negative MPD.
Train_Line_4577 A distinguishing feature of the families with mutations in GATA2 was a lack of apparent 'accessory' phenotype inside or outside the hematopoietic system, which is akin to the thrombocytopenia and eosinophilia seen in AML-predisposed families with RUNX1 and CEBPA mutations, respectively.
Train_Line_4578 We compared uptake of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) among COS-7 cells transiently expressing wild-type or mutant SHP-2 proteins and found that both D61Y and E76K SHP-2 promoted cell growth (P < 0.001 for both; Fig. 1b).
Train_Line_4579 We performed whole-exome sequencing to identify somatically acquired mutations in six patients who had primary myelofibrosis without mutations in JAK2 or MPL.
Train_Line_4580 Furthermore, exclusion of patients treated with 5-azacitidine or EPO/G-CSF (erythropoietin/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) did not alter the significance (P = .68).
Train_Line_4581 Libraries were generated according to standard procedures and paired-end sequenced (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Train_Line_4582 From a clinical viewpoint, SF3B1 mutations are independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome in terms of better OS and lower risk of leukemic evolution.
Train_Line_4583 Prognostic models could be improved by developing a predictor specifically for patients with lower-risk MDS that is based on clinical parameters.
Train_Line_4584 All 10 patients with two mutations had SNP-A karyotype done, with 70% (7/10) of patients showing unaltered 17p and 30% with 17p aberration, 1 deletion and 2 CN-LOH.
Train_Line_4585 In ET, the mutation-positive subgroup was found to have lower MCV than the subgroup without the mutation and contained more patients with MCV values below the normal range.
Train_Line_4586 Interestingly, unlike SF3B1, we did not identify an association between SRSF2, U2AF1, or ZRSR2 mutation status and the presence of ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_4587 Mononuclear cells from patient samples were enriched by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were stored at -196--degrees--C in liquid nitrogen until use.
Train_Line_4588 In haemopoietic malignancies mutant forms of KIT have been observed in CBF AML and SM.
Train_Line_4589 METHODS.
Train_Line_4590 After 27 months of follow-up, the incidences of thrombotic complications were 3.6% for hydroxyurea and 24% for no hydroxyurea, although the "thrombotic" episodes in two patients in the nonhydroxyurea arm constituted superficial thrombophlebitis.
Train_Line_4591 Moreover, further analysis of this phenomenon suggests that the transforming effects of R-2HG may specifically be related to the fact that R-2HG acts as a cofactor to promote the hydroxylase activity of the EglN prolyl-4-hydroxylases, while S-2HG does not.
Train_Line_4592 46/1 JAK2V617F status.
Train_Line_4593 Its optimal fit compared with other cut-points (ie, 55, 60, 65, and 75) was confirmed by the Akaike information criterion.
Train_Line_4594 Figure 1. Somatic BRCC3 mutations as detected by next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing. (A) Distribution of BRCC3 mutations identified in 28 out of 1444 myeloid neoplasms. Blue, red, black, pink, and green triangles indicate nonsense, frame shift, missense, splice site, and non-frame shift deletion mutations. On the right, a representative mutation (c.C19T, indicated by an arrow) confirmed by whole exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. (B) (Top) Allelic frequencies in paired bone marrow and CD3+ T-cell samples (n=2) and not paired (n=23) samples as measured by deep sequencing. (Bottom) Depth of coverage of independent reads.
Train_Line_4595 These findings suggest that mutations of C/EBPalpha are rare events in lung cancers and that C/EBPalpha deactivation occurs through alternative mechanisms.
Train_Line_4596 Both somatic and germline mutations indicate that DDX41 is a tumor suppressor gene and an important driver in myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_4597 Similar to the findings in Noonan syndrome, all the mutations in PTPN11 that we identified in children with JMML, MDS or AML affected residues located at the NSH2 and PTP interacting surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 1 online) and were predicted to cause gain of function in SHP-2 through preferential occupation of the activated state.
Train_Line_4598 Using whole-genome sequencing of a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for MLL (also called KMT2A) gene-rearranged leukemia, we identified a transforming MLL-NRIP3 fusion gene and biallelic mutations in SETD2 (encoding a histone H3K36 methyltransferase).
Train_Line_4599 We also analyzed the mutation status of 14 other relevant molecular genes in these MDS patients.
Train_Line_4600 This study was approved by the Dongsan Medical Center's Institutional Review Board.
Train_Line_4601 Aberrations described in MDS include recurrent mutations in NRAS, TP53, RUNX1, and FMS, with the recent additions of TET2, IDH, and EZH2.
Train_Line_4602 The median time between the first and the last mutational screenings was 12 months; 74 patients (52%) had one subsequent analysis, 32 (23%) patients, two, and 36 (25%) patients, three or more subsequent analyses.
Train_Line_4603 Cplx: 46,XX,add(5)(p15),del(5)(q11q35),add(6)(p23),add(8)(p21),add(10)(q25),del(12)(p11p13),der(14)t(7;14)(q11;p12),add(19)(q13).
Train_Line_4604 NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD- versus other subtypes.
Train_Line_4605 This is at least consistent that the concept that the same mutation can cause 2 completely different diseases depending on the cell type in which it occurs.
Train_Line_4606 The Italian CN-AML series was characterized for mutations in NPM1, FLT3, and DNMT3A.
Train_Line_4607 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4608 Specific dosages and interventions may vary among different countries and populations.
Train_Line_4609 Similarly to Graubert et al who reported that U2AF1 mutations were associated with an increased risk of progression to AML, we observed a trend toward a more rapid progression to AML for patients with U2AF1 mutations.
Train_Line_4610 Klampfl et al performed exome sequencing on samples obtained from 6 such patients and identified acquired insertion and deletion CALR mutations in all 6 patients.

Train_Line_4612 A recent study has shown that DNMT3A and SF3B1 mutations commonly cooccur, suggesting a possible biologic cooperativity between the 2 molecular lesions.
Train_Line_4613 Age more than 50 years relative to age less than or equal to 50 years (the reference).
Train_Line_4614 In this univariable analysis, only mutations in TP53 were significantly associated with shorter OS (HR, 3.74; 95% CI, 2.08 to 6.75; P < .001).
Train_Line_4615 Next generation sequencing.
Train_Line_4616 The observation that different oncogenic mutant forms of KIT vary greatly in sensitivity to imatinib illustrated the need for mutation analysis in individual patients in order to determine which patients would benefit from treatment with the drug as well as the appropriate dose to use.
Train_Line_4617 Leu359 contacts DNA at the guanine residue of the WGATAR consensus motif and, based on in vitro DNA binding and transactivation assays, p.Leu359Val has previously been reported to be a gain-of-function alteration, whereas p.Ala341_Gly346del appears to be a partial loss-of-function alteration.
Train_Line_4618 Retrospective analyses suggest that a subset of these mutations may have prognostic significance in AML, although these findings have not been validated with detailed clinical and mutational annotation in large, homogeneously treated cohorts of patients with AML.
Train_Line_4619 The JAK2V617F allele has recently been identified in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF).
Train_Line_4620 There was no difference in other clinical parameters, including sex, WBC count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and lactate dehydrogenase value between patients with and without the mutation.
Train_Line_4621 This finding also fits with recent results in humans in which JAK2V617F-heterozygous erythroid cells from PV and ET patients exhibit different gene expression profiles, with erythroid cells from ET patients displaying an IFN-y-stimulated gene expression pattern.
Train_Line_4622 Concerning expression levels, despite the higher level of SOCS3 transcript seen in JAK2 V617F-positive patients in our study, the level of SOCS3 transcript showed no significant correlation with survival.
Train_Line_4623 Important candidates have been identified in GIST and CBF AML.
Train_Line_4624 Bone marrow cells were harvested directly or after 1-3 days of unstimulated culture and the metaphase chromosomes were banded by the G-banding as described earlier.
Train_Line_4625 We demonstrated that specific mutations can be associated with prognostic clinical features and overall survival in this cohort.
Train_Line_4626 Among these two second-line drugs, I prefer the use of INF-a for patients younger than age 65 years and busulfan in the older age group, although there is no controlled evidence to support or refute such a strategy.
Train_Line_4627 When we analyzed the clonal architecture of somatic DDX41 mutations, we observed an average variant allelic frequency (VAF) of 25 += 10%.
Train_Line_4628 Reintroduction of SH2B3 GV resulted in less clonal inhibition compared to WT SH2B3, while SH2B3 EQ caused a non-significant decrease in clonal inhibition (Fig 1C).
Train_Line_4629 These observations strongly support a causal relationship between CALR mutations and excessive platelet production.
Train_Line_4630 Similar increases were observed in MPLW515L spleen cells compared with MPLWT with an ~30-fold increase in the proportion of CD41+ cells observed in MPLW515L spleen cells compared with MPLWT (Figure 5B, bottom panels).
Train_Line_4631 These observations suggest that modulating C/EBPalpha function in the lung may be useful for the treatment of different forms of respiratory distress syndrome.
Train_Line_4632 The RUNX1/AML1 gene encodes a transcription factor with a major role in hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_4633 Thus, increased activation of JAK-STAT signaling is probably responsible for the cytokine-independent growth of cells expressing the type 1 mutation of CALR.
Train_Line_4634 Leukocytosis has also been associated with leukemic and JAK2V617F allele burden with fibrotic transformation in PV.
Train_Line_4635 We next assessed the CpG island within the SOCS3 promoter.
Train_Line_4636 Our data seem to support this hypothesis.
Train_Line_4637 Dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of STAT3, ERK, and AKT was observed in 32D MPLW515L and MPLWT cells but not in 32D FIP1L1-PDGFRA cells (Figure 7B; unpublished data).
Train_Line_4638 The coding regions and all splice sites of both SOCS1 and SOCS3 were amplified and sequenced.
Train_Line_4639 Biallelic TP53 alteration.
Train_Line_4640 Furthermore, a composite risk score, previously established for CML, that includes patient age, disease stage, time interval from diagnosis to transplant, donor type, and donor-recipient sex combination, has been shown to be highly predictive of TRM, leukemia-free survival, and OS also in patients with AML.
Train_Line_4641 Mouse knock-in experiments, in which the wild type Kit alleles were replaced by alleles coding for receptor lacking recruitment sites for particular downstream effectors, resulted in tissue-selective consequences (e.g., [31).
Train_Line_4642 SOCS1 expression was increased, to varying degrees, in most types of MPD. Raised SOCS1 mRNA levels have also been detected in bone marrow of MPD patients using formalin-fixed bone marrow trephines.
Train_Line_4643 Seventy-one TET2 mutations, with a relative mutation abundance (RMA) > 10%, were identified in 39 of 320 (12%) myelodysplastic syndrome and 16 of 35 (46%) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patients (P < .001).
Train_Line_4644 In approximately one-fifth of cases, moreover, the relatively low SF3B1 mutant allele burden was more compatible with a minority clone, suggesting that myelodysplastic transformation had been driven by other molecular mechanisms in these subjects and that the SF3B1 mutation represented a secondary genetic event.
Train_Line_4645 Whether the occurrence of t(7;11) would cause any specific conformational change closed to WT1 conferring its vulnerability to mutation warrants further study.
Train_Line_4646 Metaphase chromosomes were banded by the trypsin-Giemsa method and karyotyped according to International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.

Global H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 levels were detected by western blot assays. Histone H3 was used as a loading control. (c) Global H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 levels in leukemic cells isolated from patients with either AML or ALL detected by western blot assays. The SETD2 mutational status for each patient is indicated. H3 was used as a loading control. (d) The signal intensity of each band in c was quantified by ImageJ. The intensities of H3K36me3 and H3K36me2 were normalized to that of H3 for each lane and are shown in a bar plot. The SETD2 mutational status for each patient is indicated.
Train_Line_4648 We determined the stability of TP53 mutations during clinical follow-up in 119 samples from 51 patients, 10 with and 41 without TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_4649 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_4650 In a phase 3 trial of patients from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) E1900 cohort, IDH2 mutations at the Arg140 residue were specifically associated with a favorable outcome in AML, both in the entire cohort without regard to the cytogenetic subset as well as in cytogenetically defined intermediate-risk AML patients.
Train_Line_4651 It is possible that DDX41 plays a role in the pathogenesis of del(5q), in particular in those cases with longer interstitial deletions, which, unlike the smaller defects, convey unfavorable prognosis (Jerez et al, 2012).
Train_Line_4652 Figure 2. Relationship between SF3B1 mutant allele burden and proportion of ring sideroblasts. Values for percentage of ring sideroblasts are grouped here in 3 arbitrary categories: <15% (n = 183), 15% to 50% (n = 85), and >50% (n = 57). Data are shown in a box plot depicting the smallest and largest observation (lowest and highest horizontal line, respectively), lower and upper quartile with median value (box), and outliers (dots).
Train_Line_4653 Eight of the double mutant cases had an equivalent allele burden for both mutations (>30%) indicative of a single disease clone, whilst the remaining two had contrasting allele burdens, indicative of two separate disease clones.
Train_Line_4654 Expression of the BCOR protein was explored by Western blot in 5 AML patients carrying BCOR disruptive mutations using standard procedures.

OS (C) and time to AML progression (D) in MDS patients according to U2AF1 mutation status (log-rank test) are shown.
Train_Line_4657 While investigating genetic causes of AML families affected by myeloid neoplasms, we identified germline mutations in a DEAD/H-box helicase gene that induced late-onset MDS/AML with a predisposition to acquisition of somatic DEAD/H-box mutations.
Train_Line_4658 In recent years, several important molecular markers have been discovered in AML.
Train_Line_4659 To explore the value of somatic mutations in predicting outcome in the setting of HSCT for MDS, we used deep, massively parallel sequencing to examine 40 genes in samples from 87 patients with MDS before allogeneic transplantation.
Train_Line_4660 OS was defined as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis and the date of death (for patients who deceased) or last follow-up (for censored patients).
Train_Line_4661 Nine patients harbored the mutation c.1934dupG;p.Gly646TrpfsX12.
Train_Line_4662 Its interaction with DNA in mammals is still elusive but may involve YY1 and long intergenic noncoding (ie, Linc) RNAs.
Train_Line_4663 Cytogenetics.
Train_Line_4664 Our group has also developed luciferase-based assays that are capable of monitoring the modulation of C/EBPalpha activity in high-throughput assays utilizing a C/EBP-regulated promoter construct.
Train_Line_4665 We have previously shown a role for this domain in binding of un-phosphorylated WT, as well as V617F mutant JAK2 (Gery et al 2009).
Train_Line_4666 Anagrelide performed better in preventing venous thrombosis.
Train_Line_4667 Table 2. Univariate and Adjusted HRs Associated With Mutations in 15 Genes.
Train_Line_4668 In addition to these interactions, we recently identified that mutations in ASXL1 result in loss of ASXL1 protein expression.
Train_Line_4669 On the other hand, somatic mutations of TET2 represent a marker of clonal proliferation in MDS but are not associated with any WHO category nor have prognostic relevance.
Train_Line_4670 After removal of low-quality and clonal reads, the mean depth of the covered exome was 98-fold (tumor) and 114-fold (normal), respectively, and with 99% and 98% of the target exome being covered by at least 2 reads and 97% and 93% by at least 10 reads for tumor and normal DNA, respectively.
Train_Line_4671 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4672 As an example, from the crystal structure of autoinhibited KIT (PDB 1T45;) it can be seen that the V560G substitution would result in the loss of multiple hydrophobic interactions (e.g., with N787, I789 and F848) required to stabilise binding of the JMD to the kinase domain.
Train_Line_4673 Thus, there is a need to consider multiple variables.
Train_Line_4674 Functional Consequences of DDX41 Lesions.
Train_Line_4675 Among patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis with nonmutated JAK2 or MPL, CALR mutations were detected in 67% of those with essential thrombocythemia and 88% of those with primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_4676 Statistics.
Train_Line_4677 The natural history of Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms is characterized not only by the occurrence of thromboembolic complications but also by a tendency toward progression to more aggressive disease, including post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia or blast-phase disease.
Train_Line_4678 Complex karyotype has been defined as the presence of 3 or more (in some studies >=5) chromosome abnormalities in the absence of t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), and t(15;17), because in most studies increased karyotype complexity in these subgroups did not adversely affect outcome.
Train_Line_4679 In the low-risk disease setting, management should start with simple non-drug measures, such as avoidance of precipitating conditions, dry skin and temperature control of one's environment and water used for bathing.
Train_Line_4680 The PTPN11 alterations so far reported in human diseases were exclusively missense mutations.
Train_Line_4681 While clinical scoring systems such as the World Health Organization (WHO) adapted Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) and the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) can help to stratify patients according to their risk of death and leukemic progression, good molecular prognostic markers are still lacking.
Train_Line_4682 In PV patients, I prefer a hematocrit target of 45% but do not object to a higher target of as high as 50%, in aspirin-treated patients.
Train_Line_4683 Primer sequences and their location relative to the transcription start site were: methylation specific primers; SOCS3-MF1, 5'GAGGGGTCGTTGTTAGGAAC3', nt-1265; SOCS3MR1, 5'ACAAAAACCGAAAAAAACGC3', nt-1176; unmethylation specific primers; SOCS3-UNF1, 5'-GGAGGGGTTGTTGTTAGGAAT3', nt-1266; SOCS3-UNR1, 5'CAAAAACAAAAACCAAAAAAAACA3', nt-1175.
Train_Line_4684 Whether these types of mutations predict outcome after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in patients with MDS is not known.
Train_Line_4685 Mutations in DNMT3A were initially described by 3 independent groups in 4% to 22% of adult AML patients.
Train_Line_4686 In a multivariable analysis, mutations in the EZH2 gene were found to be significantly associated with a shorter overall survival independent of the LR-PSS and mutations in other genes.
Train_Line_4687 The mechanisms for these effects have yet to be fully elucidated.
Train_Line_4688 Recently TP53 alterations, either mutation or loss of TP53, were detected in nearly 70% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cases with complex karyotype and correlated with dismal outcome (Rucker et al 2012).
Train_Line_4689 The current data concerning the prognostic relevance of JAK2V617F in ET and PMF are still inconclusive.
Train_Line_4690 Two retrospective studies attempted to address this question by performing serial FLT3 analysis on MDS patients.
Train_Line_4691 Moreover, the existence of low, but significant, numbers of minor clones is indicative of clonal disease evolution.
Train_Line_4692 Mutation status of U2AF1 during disease evolution.
Train_Line_4693 However, it was reported that the complete knockout of ASXL1 in mice did not increase susceptibility to tumors and leukemias.
Train_Line_4694 Sequence analysis of the entire open reading frame of MPL in all JAK2V617F-negative ET and MF patients did not reveal additional somatic mutations.

Train_Line_4696 Patient 108 who was diagnosed as having RA had EZH2 mutation initially.
Train_Line_4697 The different types of KIT mutation associated with particular cancers may be a consequence of their differential effects on signalling pathways downstream of KIT- and/or tissuespecific requirements for particular pathways.
Train_Line_4698 In addition, retroviral insertional mutagenesis in NUP98-HOXD13 mice, a model for human MDS-AML, identified Gata2 as a common insertion site in mice with induced AML, all of whom overexpressed Gata2 (ref. 27).
Train_Line_4699 Note that p.Leu359Val shows gain of function (1,253 newly regulated genes compared to wild-type GATA2) and partial loss of function (457 genes no longer regulated) while retaining 786 genes commonly regulated.
Train_Line_4700 Differential prognostic effect of IDH1 versus IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes: a Mayo Clinic Study of 277 patients.
Train_Line_4701 Genotyping was performed on DNA using the Affymetrix 250K or SNP6 platform and processed strictly according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix).
Train_Line_4702 The drug was shown to cause KIT degradation and block cell proliferation in the tumours, as well as inducing tumour necrosis and shrinkage.
Train_Line_4703 No studies on IDH1 and IDH2 could be performed because mutations in these genes had not yet been discovered at the time the patient was selected for WES.
Train_Line_4704 None of these patients had KIT, PTPN11, or JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_4705 ONLINE METHODS.
Train_Line_4706 In GIST there are many different exon 11 mutations including point mutations, tandem duplications, deletions and insertions and, while the precise mechanisms may differ, these are all believed to act by preventing the interaction of the JMD with the active site cleft.
Train_Line_4707 Diagnosis was confirmed according to 2008 WHO classification criteria.
Train_Line_4708 While dasatinib has reasonable activity on this mutant in cell lines, results in clinical studies have been disappointing with limited responses.

Train_Line_4710 The distribution of BCOR disruptive mutations among the cytogenetic/molecular categories of AML is also interesting.
Train_Line_4711 Cytogenetic data were available in 446 patients. Good, normal karyotype, isolated -Y, del(5q) or del(20q); Poor, complex (>=3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 anomalies; Intermediate, other abnormalities.
Train_Line_4712 Sequential study during the clinical course showed that IDH mutation was quite stable during MDS evolution.
Train_Line_4713 NOTE. Variables considered for model inclusion were RAS mutation status (wild-type v mutated), WBC, % bone marrow blasts, cytogenetic group, consolidation therapy group (HDAC v LDAC), and the RAS mutation-consolidation therapy interaction term.
Train_Line_4714 LNK is also capable of regulating the aberrant signaling of MPL-W515L and JAK2 V617F in vitro.
Train_Line_4715 Overall, the prevalence of SF3B1 mutations was higher in females than in males (27% vs 18%, P = .02), and patients with SF3B1 mutation showed higher platelet count (median value, 257 x 109/L vs 104 x 109/L, P < .001), higher proportion of ring sideroblasts (40% vs 0%, P < .001), and marrow erythroblasts (40% vs 27%, P < .001), and lower proportion of bone marrow blasts (2% vs 3%, P < .001; supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_4716 JAK2V617F also occurs in ET and PMF with respective mutational frequencies of 55% and 65%.
Train_Line_4717 Two other mutations directly affecting this pathway have subsequently been described.
Train_Line_4718 Conclusions.
Train_Line_4719 MUTATION STATUS OF ASXL1 IN PATIENTS WITH MDS.
Train_Line_4720 Haplotype mapping using eight informative SNPs within and surrounding GATA2 showed that the c.1061C>T (p.Thr354Met) mutation segregated within two distinct haplotypes (Supplementary Table 5), indicating that this mutation has arisen at least twice among the three families in which it is found.
Train_Line_4721 In case series, OS appears to be approximately 20% to 30%.
Train_Line_4722 Statistical Analysis.
Train_Line_4723 The SF3B1 mutation status of the 67 patients with CMML, already reported in our previous study, was included in this paper to compare CMML and RARS-T within MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_4724 For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for OS and time to progression to AML and was adjusted for potential confounding covariates.
Train_Line_4725 Based on this theory, cells with partial loss of BRCC3 function could be sensitive to BRCC3 inhibition as they will have greater dependence on the remaining WT allele and thus be differentially more stressed by its inactivation.
Train_Line_4726 On the one hand, it has been reported that SOCS3 inhibits JAK2V617F signaling through proteosomal degradation.
Train_Line_4727 The base-calling was performed with GAPipeline Version 1.5.1 and produced approximately 44.5 and 42.2 million pass filter reads (in the leukemic and normal samples, respectively) of 108 bases per library (supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article), which represents 4.8-4.6 Gb per library.
Train_Line_4728 Risk Stratification.
Train_Line_4729 SF3B1 mutations in CLL.
Train_Line_4730 FLT3 (FMS-like tyrosine kinase III) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that belongs to the Class III family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; other members of this family include receptors for KIT, FMS, and PDGF).
Train_Line_4731 With the exception of NPM1 and FLT3, it seems that ASXL1 mutations coincide with mutations in many known genes including EZH2, IDH1/2, RUNX1 and TET2.
Train_Line_4732 Primary MDS-RAEB with -7, del(6)(q21), which subsequently evolved to RAEBT. gDe novo AML French-American-British M5 with t(9;11)(p22;q23), del(9)(p22), previously characterized by aplastic pre-phase.
Train_Line_4733 SIGNIFICANCE.
Train_Line_4734 On the other side, among the 80 ASXL1-wild patients, only one acquired ASXL1 mutation at leukemia transformation.
Train_Line_4735 Recurrent mutations in IDH1 have been described in 12% of patients with glioblastomas as well as in 70% of patients with WHO grade II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas.
Train_Line_4736 The prognostic relevance of these novel disease alleles remains an important area of investigation and clinical trials are currently underway to determine if these findings represent tractable therapeutic targets, either alone, or in combination with JAK2 inhibition.
Train_Line_4737 Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed with five washes of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40.
Train_Line_4738 Here, we show for the first time that SH2B3 binds CBL.
Train_Line_4739 The whole-exome sequencing produced in total approximately 276 million mapped reads (135 million from the tumor DNA and 141 million from the control DNA) of 27.6 billion nucleotides.
Train_Line_4740 Recently, the JAK2V617F mutation was found in 6/9, 5/16, 3/3, 4/6, 6/12 and 5/7 RARS-T patients, suggesting that a large proportion of RARS-T cases are JAK2 mutation-related disorders.
Train_Line_4741 Studies are required to elucidate the mechanism for activation of the JAK-STAT pathway by the mutant calreticulin in myeloid cells.
Train_Line_4742 Granulocyte SOCS1 transcript level was also increased in ET patients (p=0.005; Figure 3A) with no significant effect of JAK2 V617F status (data not shown).
Train_Line_4743 Three CpG islands were assessed: SOCS1 promoter and exon 2 regions (Figure 1A) and SOCS3 promoter region (Figure 2A).
Train_Line_4744 Analysis of ASXL1 mutation in sequential samples.
Train_Line_4745 Risk stratification based on the MDAPS was as follows; 5 (6%) high risk, 18 (20%) intermediate-2 risk, 28 (31%) intermediate-1 risk, and 40 (44%) low risk.
Train_Line_4746 Moreover, methylation studies using the HELP (HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction) assay have not thus far resolved a methylation-specific signature characteristic of DNMT3A mutant AML samples compared with DNMT3A wild-type samples.
Train_Line_4747 Among 478 patients, 160 were females and 318, males, with a median age of 66 years (range, 17-98 years).
Train_Line_4748 Patients with antecedent hematologic diseases, therapy-related AML, or acute promyelo-cytic leukemia (M3 subtype) were excluded because the pathogenesis of their leukemias and survival of these patients differ from other AML patients significantly.

Train_Line_4751 Figure 5. Schematic representation of the multistep molecular pathogenesis of RARS-T through sequential acquisition of SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations. The occurrence of a somatic mutation of SF3B1 causes mitochondrial iron overload, ineffective erythropoiesis, and anemia, typical myelodysplastic features of RARS. The subsequent occurrence of a somatic mutation of JAK2 or MPL involves the emergence of a subclone that carries 2 mutant genes (SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL) and determines gain of thrombopoietin signaling, proliferation of large atypical megakaryocytes, and thrombocytosis, typical myeloproliferative feature of RARS-T. Adapted from Cazzola et al.
Train_Line_4752 The recently discovered mutations in the splicing machinery of patients with myeloid neoplasms are predicted to affect core components of initial steps, such as the recognition of the 3' splice acceptor site of the pre-mRNA target intron (U2AF35 and SRSF2) or the recruitment of the U2 snRNP to the branch point proximal to the 3' splicing site that contains SF3B1.
Train_Line_4753 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4754 Median overall survival (OS) for FLT3-mutated MDS patients was 19.0 months versus 16.4 months for FLT3-nonmutated MDS patients (P = 0.08).
Train_Line_4755 BCR-ABL caused an intense activation of RAS and suppressed erythroid cell proliferation while JAK2 V617F resulted in less activation of RAS and did not inhibit erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_4756 A total of 23 of the 32 WT1-mutated patients concurrently had other gene mutations, including 13 (56.5%) with class 1 mutations and 16 (69.6%) with class 2 mutations or NPM1 mutations.

Train_Line_4758 Under the aegis of the MDS Foundation, the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS has started a research project aimed to develop a prognostic scoring system (IPSS-Mol) that includes clinical, hematologic, and molecular parameters.
Train_Line_4759 On the other hand, none of the 127 patients who had no U2AF1 mutation initially acquired a novel mutation during follow-ups.
Train_Line_4760 DESIGN AND METHODS.
Train_Line_4761 Total RNA was isolated by using the All Prep DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen).
Train_Line_4762 Abnormal sequencing results were confirmed by at least two repeated analyses.
Train_Line_4763 Bone marrow cells were transduced with MSCV-IRES-EGFP vectors containing MPLWT or MPLW515L and transplanted into lethally irradiated Balb/C mice.
Train_Line_4764 Long-term survival will depend on the ability to successfully induce a remission and the probability to consolidate with HSCT.
Train_Line_4765 This observation suggests that RUNX1 mutation may represent one of the most frequent genetic events implicated in MPN transformation to AML.
Train_Line_4766 Association of TP53 mutations with chromosome 5 aberration.
Train_Line_4767 Taken together, these data show that ASXL1 mutations have prognostic value in certain subgroups of AML patients.
Train_Line_4768 High-dose cytarabine.
Train_Line_4769 Of the 17 patients carrying a wild type JAK2 V617 allele, four had a methylated SOCS3 promoter (1 within granulocytes only; 3 within mononuclear cells only).

Train_Line_4771 Fisher exact test was used if the expected values of contingency tables were smaller than 5.
Train_Line_4772 Further, we made survival analysis in a relatively homogeneous population of younger patients (< 60 years) with normal karyotype (CN-AML).
Train_Line_4773 Patients with the SF3B1 mutation showed a significantly better LFS than those without mutation (HR = 0.32, 95% CI, 0.11-0.91, P = .032; Figure 3B).
Train_Line_4774 Finally, functional genetic approaches, such as large-scale RNA interference screens, have great potential for the identification of novel cancer genes.
Train_Line_4775 Allogeneic HSCT in older patients has become an active promising field of investigation.
Train_Line_4776 Unlike the other members of the SOCS family, SOCS1 and SOCS3 contain a 12 amino acid region termed the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) which binds to and inactivates the catalytic JH1 domain of JAK proteins.
Train_Line_4777 The clinical characteristics of the 12 patients with DNMT3A mutations were similar to that of the 138 patients without mutations (Table 1).
Train_Line_4778 Primary analysis was performed on OS and time to AML progression.
Train_Line_4779 DNMT3A, in conjunction with DNMT3B, is critical for proper de novo DNA methylation and development of mammals.
Train_Line_4780 Positive cells (103) were plated in triplicates in soft agar with 10 iu/ml Epo.
Train_Line_4781 However, in contrast to BCR-ABL in CML, not all mutations in MPN patients represent the driving event towards clonal hematopoiesis, and their role in disease pathophysiology requires further investigation.
Train_Line_4782 The authors found that mice expressing the R132H mutation produced 10-fold higher serum 2-HG than wild-type littermates.
Train_Line_4783 U2AF1 and SRSF2 bind to the RNA directly, whereas ZRSR2 interacts with U2AF1 and SF3B1 binds to U2snRNP7.
Train_Line_4784 We correlated TP53 alterations, as assessed by DNA sequence analysis and array profiling, with the pattern of chromosome abnormalities identified by conventional cytogenetics and with the pattern of CNAs detected by array-based analyses (Table 1).
Train_Line_4785 Germ-line mutations of this gene are associated with oculofaciocar-diodental and Lenz microphthalmia syndromes.
Train_Line_4786 The p.Q423X is located on exon 7 of LNK gene and results in a premature stop codon in the SH2 domain.
Train_Line_4787 With HDAC, patients with mutated RAS had a substantial reduction in relapse risk relative to those with wild-type RAS.
Train_Line_4788 The spin infection was repeated 24 hours later.
Train_Line_4789 This hypothesis has been validated only in one case of wild-type JAK2 AML, which had emerged from an original TET2 mutated clone found in the initial MPN.
Train_Line_4790 The association between a splice gene mutation and a specific clinical phenotype remained independently significant when analyzed together with IPSS-risk group and WHO disease subtype in a linear regression model (eg, SF3B1 mutation and reduced hemoglobin levels [P = .011], or SRSF2 mutation and thrombocytopenia [P = .025]).
Train_Line_4791 There was no significant difference in the hematocrit of MPLW515L mice compared with MPLWT mice.
Train_Line_4792 Risk-Adapted therapy.
Train_Line_4793 The result is constitutive activation of JAK-STAT/PI3K/AKT downstream pathways through alteration of the regulatory pseudokinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation of STAT5 and STAT3.
Train_Line_4794 MUTATIONS IN "EPIGENETIC REGULATOR GENES": A PRE-JAK2 EVENT?
Train_Line_4795 The major DNMTs with methyltransferase activity in humans are DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.
Train_Line_4796 While the D816V mutation confers resistance by strongly favouring the active conformation of the kinase domain, the precise mechanism in the case of N822K is less certain.
Train_Line_4797 There is accumulating evidence that allogeneic HSCT is an attractive option for those patients who are at high risk of relapse.
Train_Line_4798 Co-occurrence of IDH mutation with other genetic alterations was also noted in other myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_4799 Until the WBC has been reduced, excessive red blood cell transfusions can lead to increased blood viscosity.
Train_Line_4800 Acquired UPD is due to a mitotic recombination event and may render a cell homozygous for a preexisting mutation located in the affected genomic region.
Train_Line_4801 By itself, loss of Tet2 does not appear to result in AML in mice.
Train_Line_4802 Also, we detected no GATA2 mutations in 15 hematopoietic cell lines (Supplementary Table 4).
Train_Line_4803 Progress has been made in deciphering the molecular pathogenesis of AML, and in a few instances this has led to the development of molecularly targeted approaches.
Train_Line_4804 IKZF DELETION.
Train_Line_4805 Exon 2 is included in half of the transcripts starting from exon 1 and contains an ATG; a second ATG is located at the beginning of exon 3.
Train_Line_4806 The situation is completely analogous for KIT (authors' unpublished data), where we have not been able to dock PKC412 into either of the two inactive conformation crystal structures, whereas it can be docked into the active conformation of KIT (PDB 1PKG).
Train_Line_4807 Somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in 150 of 533 (28.1%) patients with MDS, 16 of 83 (19.3%) with MDS/MPN, and 2 of 38 (5.3%) with AML.
Train_Line_4808 In summary, we identified IDH mutations in 4.6% of MDS patients with a preference of IDH2 mutation.
Train_Line_4809 The remaining 30 patients showed only one mutation; all are heterozygous.
Train_Line_4810 MPL mutations were identified in 3% of patients with ET and 10% of patients with PMF and correlate with older age, female gender, lower hemoglobin, and more pronounced thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_4811 Because CALR mutations are found in approximately 73% of patients who do not have mutations of JAK2 and MPL, we believe they fill in the current molecular diagnostic gap in myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Train_Line_4813 Table 2. Comparison of other genetic alterations between MDS patients with and without the ASXL1 mutation.
Train_Line_4814 This chromosomal translocation occurs more frequently in the East than in the West35 and is associated with poor prognosis.
Train_Line_4815 Seventeen of 25 patients harboring 2 or more TP53 mutations exhibited no TP53 loss; 5 of these showed a homozygous TP53 mutation; and in all remaining patients with available DNA for subcloning (n = 8), compound heterozygous mutations were confirmed.
Train_Line_4816 Further rescue experiments and animal models are essential to authenticate these findings on BRCC3-associated leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_4817 All comparisons performed using two-sided Fisher's Exact Test, except: two-sided Mann-Whitney U test; Wilcoxon-Gehan; log-rank.
Train_Line_4818 Thus, when assessing for TP53 mutational status in CK-AML, it will be necessary to include DNA sequence analysis.
Train_Line_4819 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_4820 Previous studies have suggested that mutational analysis of CEBPA, NPM1, and FLT3-ITD can be used to stratify risk among patients with intermediate-risk AML.
Train_Line_4821 C/EBPalpha translation can be efficiently stimulated in vitro using the triterpenoid antineoplastic drug 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), which increases the translation of p42 CEPBalpha and the ratio of p42/p30 C/EBPalpha, leading to granulocytic differentiation in myeloid cells.
Train_Line_4822 MEK inhibitors also inhibit serine-21 phosphorylation of C/EBPalpha, leading to a more active protein and to enhanced granulocytic differentiation.
Train_Line_4823 Prognostic factors may be subdivided into those related to patient characteristics and general health condition and those related to characteristics particular to the AML clone.
Train_Line_4824 cDNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).
Train_Line_4825 A continuum exists between the BCR-ABL-negative MPN and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), as exemplified by chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), classified as MPN/MDS by the World Health Organization.
Train_Line_4826 However, it refines our treatment approach by giving us some flexibility on management, as will be discussed below.
Train_Line_4827 With respect to OS, it is not clear whether any agent is superior to daunorubicin at equivalent doses.
Train_Line_4828 Compromised BRCC3 function in DSB repair, which is presumably to remove DSB repair proteins by degradation during DSB resolution, may cause an imbalance repair proteins globally, and as a result, genomic instability.
Train_Line_4829 One hundred eighty-five patients with AML achieving complete remission on Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 8525 and randomly assigned to one of three doses of cytarabine postremission were screened for RAS mutations.
Train_Line_4830 Cohort 2 was from Italy (n = 353) and was studied using conventional direct Sanger sequencing.
Train_Line_4831 In the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues, MDSs are defined as clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by cytopenia, myelodysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis, and increased risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_4832 While inversion 16 cases show hypermethylation of the C/EBPalpha promoter, t(8;21) cases do not.
Train_Line_4833 Phospho-flow analysis.
Train_Line_4834 A majority of ASXL1-mutated patients had concurrently other gene mutations, most commonly RUNX1 and EZH2 mutations.
Train_Line_4835 Cell lines carrying a methylated SOCS3 promoter show no expression and treatment with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine results in reactivation of SOCS3 transcription confirming the link between methylation and transcriptional inactivation.
Train_Line_4836 In univariate analysis, mutated SRSF2 predicted shorter overall survival and more frequent acute myeloid leukemia progression compared with wildtype SRSF2, whereas mutated U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 had no impact on patient outcome.
Train_Line_4837 The cells were then washed and resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution, and injected into lateral tail veins of lethally irradiated (2 3 4.5 Gy [450 rad]) Balb/C recipient mice (Taconic, Germantown, New York, United States) at 0.5 to 1.0 x 106 cells/mouse.
Train_Line_4838 Haplotyping.
Train_Line_4839 In its phosphorylated form, interaction with MEP50 is blocked, resulting in decreased arginine methylation of histones H2A/H4, leading towards a skewed erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_4840 Of the 60 MF patients in whom SOCS3 methylation was assessed, 50 had idiopathic myelofibrosis and, among these, two showed coexisting myelodysplastic features.
Train_Line_4841 Criteria for dysplasia were those established by the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_4842 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_4843 The 221 MDS samples were collected at time of enrolment in multicenter clinical trials in France between 1999 and 2011 at Paris Cochin (n = 134) and Marseille Institute Paoli-Calmette (n = 87).
Train_Line_4844 SH2B3 directly attenuates EPOR phosphorylation and JAK2 activation, thereby inhibiting major signalling pathways initiated by Epo/EPOR.
Train_Line_4845 4. Hematopoiesis of JAK2V617F MPN is quite surprising for a clonal disorder involving a HSC.
Train_Line_4846 Transfusion practice before, during and after HSCT.
Train_Line_4847 Of the 41 patients with genomic aberrations, 8 (20%) had TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_4848 On CALGB 8525, patients 60 years of age or younger received induction chemotherapy of daunorubicin 45 mg/m2/d intravenously for 3 days and cytarabine 200 mg/m2/d as a continuous infusion for 7 days, whereas patients older than 60 years received daunorubicin 30 mg/m2/d intravenously for 3 days and cytarabine 200 mg/m2/d as a continuos infusion for 7 days.
Train_Line_4849 We examined 193 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and 53 patients with acute myeloid leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndromes for mutations in IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R172 and R140), and NPM1 by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_4850 Figure 1. The DNMT family of enzymes and their known effects on hematopoiesis and DNA methylation. The DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B catalyze methylation of CpG dinucleotides in genomic DNA. (A) The conserved domains, function, and biological effect of each DNMT member. (B) Currently, it is understood that DNMT3A and DNMT3B are essential for the establishment of DNA cytosine methylation as they catalyze the addition of methyl groups onto the C5 position of DNA cytosine residues without regard for the methylation status of DNA. In contrast, DNMT1 appears to be essential for maintenance of DNA methylation after DNA replication as DNMT1 (1) binds PCNA and (2) has preferential enzymatic activity for hemimethylated DNA over unmethylated DNA. DNMT3L, in contrast, lacks catalytic activity but appears to physically interact with DNMT3A and stimulate its enzymatic activity. PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PHD, plant homeodomain; PWWP, proline tryptophan tryptophan proline.
Train_Line_4851 Both patients harbored the canonical germline DDX41 mutation.
Train_Line_4852 Therefore, p30 C/EBPalpha is required and sufficient for commitment of CMPs to the myeloid lineage, whereas p42 C/EBPalpha is required for cell cycle arrest and the tumor-suppressing functions in myeloid progenitors.
Train_Line_4853 In CMML, SRSF2 is the most commonly mutated spliceosome gene (28-47%) and has been associated with older age, less pronounced anemia and a diploid karyotype.
Train_Line_4854 Computerized literature searches of the PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline databases in the English language were conducted using key words relevant to the various sections of this article.
Train_Line_4855 First, while mutations in ASXL1 are present in 6% to 30% of AML patients, there is a positive correlation of ASXL1 mutations with advancing age, and ASXL1 mutations have been found in 16.2% to 25% of AML patients >60 years of age compared with 3.6% to 8% of adult AML patients >60 years of age.
Train_Line_4856 It was also shown previously that mutated U2AF1 has a growth-suppressive effect in vitro7 and this effect might contribute to the cytopenias seen in clinical MDS patients.
Train_Line_4857 Clinical characteristics.
Train_Line_4858 Purpose.
Train_Line_4859 Alternative anthracyclines, high-dose cytarabine, additional agents given with conventional induction chemotherapy.
Train_Line_4860 Part of this difficulty reflects the tendency to report results of single-arm trials without reference to even a historical control group.
Train_Line_4861 However, when restricting survival analysis to patients with RSs (RARS, RCMD-RS or RARS-T; n = 36 with available clinical information), no difference on OS or AML transformation rate was observed (data not shown).
Train_Line_4862 Mutation analyses of 11 other relevant molecular marker genes (NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3/ITD and FLT3/TKD, N-RAS, K-RAS, JAK2, KIT, MLL/PTD, AML1/RUNX1, and PTPN11) were performed as previously described.
Train_Line_4863 We first examined the IPSS, considering patient age (< 60 v >= 60 years), sex, IPSS risk group, and the mutation status of each of the 15 genes mutated in more than 1% of patients as candidate variables in the model (Table 3).
Train_Line_4864 They are generally associated with signs of aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome.
Train_Line_4865 It is possible that RNA helicase mutations constitute a separate class of spliceosomal defects.
Train_Line_4866 The TP53 mutations strongly correlated with copy number aberrations involving chromosome 5, as 90% of patients with mutations had either isolated 5q- or -5/5q-concomitantly with other abnormalities especially -7/7q- and -17/17p-.
Train_Line_4867 The gain of function of SHP-2 probably represents an early initiating lesion in JMML oncogenesis, but additional studies are required to delineate the role of SHP-2 defects in the development of MDS and AML.
Train_Line_4868 This, in my opinion, is the reason for the apparent association in some studies between leukemic transformation and drug therapy in PV or ET.
Train_Line_4869 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_4870 More recently, a series of studies have extensively characterized the prognostic relevance of ASXL1 mutations in AML (Table 2).
Train_Line_4871 In a subsequent step, the patients were retrospectively characterized and found to carry IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 3 and 16 patients, respectively (supplemental Table 11).
Train_Line_4872 We conclude that consideration of TET2 and DNMT3A mutation status can help predict the risk of mortality in patients with MDS.
Train_Line_4873 Candidate mutations were reamplified and sequenced from original DNA for independent verification, and sequence analysis of buccal DNA was performed to ascertain whether non-synonymous mutations were constitutional or somatic in origin.
Train_Line_4874 All 18 TP53-mutant patients died before 5 years after transplantation, and 83% had MDS present at time of death (Table 4).
Train_Line_4875 This family of adaptor proteins is characterized by a conserved structure with 3 main domains (a proline-rich amino terminus, a plekstrin homology domain, an SH2 domain) and a conserved tyrosine at the C-terminus.
Train_Line_4876 Similar results were obtained when the analysis was restricted to patients with a normal karyotype (Fig. S9A in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_4877 Additionally, two separate TP53 mutations were seen in 9 patients with CK and such double mutations, if biallelic and part of a single clone, would not produce any wild type protein in a situation analogous to LOH.
Train_Line_4878 The methylation-specific primers (MSP) and unmethylation-specific primers (UMSP) were described by Liu et al. (promoter region) and Yoshikawa et al. (exon 2 region).
Train_Line_4879 However, the preclinical and clinical development of these agents may be influenced by the identification that these agents may require longer exposure to have therapeutic efficacy than has been the case with traditional cytotoxic therapies or small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Train_Line_4880 Patients with polycythemia vera who were negative for the JAK2 V617F mutation were tested for mutations in JAK2 exon 12.
Train_Line_4881 Gray's method was constructed to build a multivariable CIR model using a limited backwards selection procedure.
Train_Line_4882 Median OS for CMML patients with FLT3 mutation was 12 months compared to 21 months for those without FLT3 mutation (P = 0.12; Fig. 2).
Train_Line_4883 I usually start pegylated IFN-a at 45 mg once-a-week and titrate up to 180 mg once-a-week if tolerated.
Train_Line_4884 RESULTS.
Train_Line_4885 Of note, the MDS study showing a detrimental prognostic effect of mutant IDH involved only IDH1 mutations.
Train_Line_4886 These data led to the concept of a pre-JAK2 event.
Train_Line_4887 Receptor dimerisation following ligand binding allows this basal activity to bring about trans-phosphorylation of Y568 and Y570 residues in the JMD releasing its interaction with the kinase domain and promoting the fully active conformation.
Train_Line_4888 In relapsing GIST patients, different tumour foci frequently contain different secondary mutations such that no single drug is likely to be effective.
Train_Line_4889 Therefore, it is not generally recommended that HiDAC be included in induction regimens outside clinical trials.
Train_Line_4890 * Cancer stem cells appear to be relatively resistant to treatment with KIT inhibitors.
Train_Line_4891 There was also an increase in the number of myeloid colonies in methylcellulose supplemented with cytokines from MPLW515L-expressing spleen cells (Figure 6E), but not bone marrow cells (Figure 6D), consistent with a shift in hematopoiesis from the bone marrow to the spleen in MPLW515L-expressing mice.
Train_Line_4892 To investigate whether mutations in CALR are acquired early or late in the clonal history of a patient, we analyzed hematopoietic-progenitor colonies from 2 patients for whom we had mutational profiles based on whole-exome sequencing.
Train_Line_4893 ASXL1 mutations in disease evolution.
Train_Line_4894 For immunoprecipitation, lysates were incubated in lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, with specific antibodies and protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4--degrees--C for 16 h.
Train_Line_4895 Seven patients (54%) among the SF3B1-mutated cohort had a diploid karyotype, one patient had trisomy 8, and there were no patients with a complex/monosomal karyotype.
Train_Line_4896 As expected from its negative role in JAK2 signaling, LNK is also capable of attenuating the signaling induced by MPLW515L or JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_4897 Following the success in treating patients with advanced disease, imatinib has been trialled in an adjuvant context in GIST patients with primary disease following potentially curative surgery.
Train_Line_4898 We checked the proportional-hazards assumption by testing for a nonzero slope in a regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_4899 Acquired mutations affecting other components of these signaling pathways are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of JAK2 V617F-negative MPD.
Train_Line_4900 Germline alterations may constitute a predisposition factor for the acquisition of somatic mutations in the same genes, as is the case with JAK2, in which the rs10974944 polymorphism increases the risk for somatic JAK2 V617F mutations (Kilpivaara et al, 2009; Olcaydu et al, 2009).
Train_Line_4901 All BM slides, including iron stains for quantification of BM RS were centrally reviewed.
Train_Line_4902 Indeed, we found that mutations in any of four genes (ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53, and EZH2) present in 25% of patients carried independent prognostic information after adjusting for LR-PSS risk categories, demonstrating the value of considering genetic information to improve the determination of prognosis.
Train_Line_4903 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_4904 The definition of complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival(RFS) followed recommended criteria.
Train_Line_4905 Acquired somatic mutations of TET2 have been detected in different myeloid neoplasms and in approximately 25% of MDS patients.
Train_Line_4906 Patients.
Train_Line_4907 Bone marrow specimens typically showed hypercellularity and a disturbed topographical organization.
Train_Line_4908 As indicated in the new WHO classification, cases with other recurring genetic abnormalities, such as AML with t(9;11) or t(v;11), AML with inv(3) or t(3;3), and AML with t(6;9) should also be excluded, because these groups constitute separate entities.
Train_Line_4909 The WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) takes advantage of the prognostic relevance of the WHO classification, is able to classify MDS patients into 5 risk groups showing different survivals and probabilities of leukemic evolution, and can be used not only at diagnosis but also during follow-up.
Train_Line_4910 To account for potential bias of DNA source in the evaluation of SF3B1 mutation status and mutant allele burden, we studied potential differences between these subgroups (supplemental Figure 2).
Train_Line_4911 Various other factors, such as splenomegaly and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, have been reported to confer some prognostic effect but with variable consistency among studies. The significance of a prognostic factor is always dependent on the therapy given to a patient.
Train_Line_4912 Genes that might be mutated before JAK2 in MPNs normally participate in the epigenetic control of transcription.
Train_Line_4913 Additionally, none of the sequentially analysed patients with mutations showed a total disappearance of the mutant clone or emergence of new clones.
Train_Line_4914 Explorative subset analysis suggested that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had no favorable impact on outcome in TP53-altered CK-AML.
Train_Line_4915 Brcc3 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting analysis at 96 h after infection with a Brcc3-specific lentiviral shRNA.
Train_Line_4916 Contrary to these findings, our study has demonstrated that neither SRSF2 mutations nor mutations involving SF3B1 or U2AF35 impact prognosis (OS and LFS) in CMML.
Train_Line_4917 International prognosis scoring system: low, 0; intermediate (INT)-1, 0.5-1; INT-2, 1.5-2; and high, >=2.5.
Train_Line_4918 To counter imatinib insensitivity due to the "gatekeeper" mutations, the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor sunitinib was developed.
Train_Line_4919 AML transformation was defined according to the 2008 WHO classification and patients known to be alive without report of AML transformation were censored at the date of last examination confirming the absence of transformation, with refreshment in February 2013 when available.
Train_Line_4920 The mechanism by which GATA2 p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del alterations function is distinct to that generally described for RUNX1 and CEBPA, which commonly act as classical tumor suppressor genes with a wide range of mutations and requiring functional disruption of both alleles.
Train_Line_4921 Therefore, bone marrow examination is often necessary to make an accurate morphologic diagnosis of ET and distinguish it from other myeloid neoplasms, especially from prefibrotic PMF; megakaryocytes in ET are large and mature-appearing whereas those in prefibrotic PMF display abnormal maturation with hyperchromatic and irregularly folded nuclei.
Train_Line_4922 The reason why P95 lends itself to be a mutational hot spot is currently unknown.
Train_Line_4923 Somatic gene mutations in myelodysplasia: from studies of candidate genes to whole genome sequencing.
Train_Line_4924 The largest reported series of FLT3 mutations in MDS was published by Bacher et al in 2007.
Train_Line_4925 We confirmed that mutations in certain genes are associated with disease subtypes, differences in overall survival, and clinical features.
Train_Line_4926 Sixteen (69.6%) of them had at least one concurrent class 2 mutation that would impair differentiation of hematopoietic cells, and 13 (56.5%) had a class 1 mutation that would confer proliferation advantage (Table 4).
Train_Line_4927 There was no association between mutation detection and the myeloblast count of the banked bone marrow specimen (median blast count was 5% in patients without DNMT3A mutations, vs. 7% in patients with DNMT3A mutations, p=0.31), suggesting that mutations were not missed due to the cellular heterogeneity in the samples.
Train_Line_4928 An alternative to standard-dose induction should be sought for patients 75 or older (and probably >=65) with a performance status of 2 or 3, comorbidities, or organ dysfunction.
Train_Line_4929 A marked increase in HOXA gene transcription has been associated with ASXL1 loss of function.
Train_Line_4930 Blast percentage is given according to the diagnostic report; the percentage of leukemic cells actually present can be greater in the samples used for sequencing because the latter were mostly Ficoll-enriched with mononuclear leukemic cells before nucleic acid extraction. In the chromatogram of these samples, the size of the mutated peak relative to the proportion of leukemic cells was consistent with a clonal event.
Train_Line_4931 In multivariate analysis including IDH1 mutation status, IPSS score, transfusion dependence, and karyotype, the presence of an IDH1 mutation was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for overall survival (Table 4).
Train_Line_4932 The JAK2 V617F (exon 14) was detected in 26 of 42 patients (61.9%), but the exon 12 mutation was not detected in this study.
Train_Line_4933 Somatic or germ-line mutations of RAS pathway gene are present in ~90% of patients with juvenile CMML, an MDS/MPN in which secondary mutations of SETBP1 and JAK3 may cause disease progression.

Train_Line_4939 This excludes chromosomal defects, such as copy number variation or copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity involving chromosome 2q33.1, where SF3B1 maps.
Train_Line_4940 In addition to age, these variables include International Prognostic Scoring System risk group, ferritin level, monosomal karyotype, and disease burden before transplantation.
Train_Line_4941 Thus, it is possible that MPL signaling differs between HSC and MKs and/or that JAK2V617F only partially activates normal MPL functions in HSC.

Train_Line_4943 In the presence of aspirin-resistant symptoms, it is reasonable to utilize a twice-daily rather than once-daily regimen of low dose aspirin or alternative antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel (75 mg/day) alone or in combination with aspirin, as long as patients are monitored closely for drug side effects.
Train_Line_4944 These findings resulted in a higher proportion of transfusion dependence for SF3B1-mut compared with SF3B1-wt patients (59% vs 38%; P = .024).
Train_Line_4945 We recently reported that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with TET2 mutations; detailed mutational analysis revealed that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were also mutually exclusive with WT1 mutations (P<0.001) (Fig. S3 and Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_4946 No significant relationship was found between mutant allele burden and clinical or hematologic features, including clinical outcome.
Train_Line_4947 These disorders sometimes turn into acute leukemia.
Train_Line_4948 In the sequential analysis of 38 patients, Makishima et al reported that an U2AF1 mutation detected at the secondary AML stage in one patient was also present at initial presentation.
Train_Line_4949 Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.
Train_Line_4950 A detailed overview of mutation sites is shown in Figure 1.
Train_Line_4951 Mutation analysis of SOCS1 and SOCS3.
Train_Line_4952 Because mutations could be associated with adverse clinical features associated with OS, we performed an adjusted multivariable analysis to assess the association of patient mutations in TP53 and other genes with OS (Table 2).
Train_Line_4953 This will be very important for understanding MPN pathogenesis and develop new therapies, and also, more generally, to understand the stepwise mechanisms leading to cancer development in humans.
Train_Line_4954 Associations of continuous measures between groups were assessed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test; for categorical variables, they were assessed using Fisher's exact test.
Train_Line_4955 In the presence of aspirin-resistant symptoms, it is reasonable to utilize alternative anti-platelet agents such as clopidogrel (75 mg/day) alone or in combination with aspirin, as long as patients are monitored closely for drug-side effects.
Train_Line_4956 5.2.1 Cytogenetics.
Train_Line_4957 The C/EBPalpha mutations found in AML are typically biallelic and involve frameshift mutations of the 5J region of the coding sequence on one allele and in-frame insertion/deletion mutations within a narrow 3J region on the other allele, leading to so-called N-terminal and C-terminal mutations of the protein, respectively (Fig 3A and B).
Train_Line_4958 P values are computed using Mann--Whitney test for continuous variables and Fischer's exact test for categorical variables. WHO, World Health Organization; RA, refractory anaemia; RARS, refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblasts; RCMD (-RS), refractory anaemia with multilineage dysplasia (with ringed sideroblasts); RAEB, refractory anaemia with excess blasts; sAML, secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML derived from MDS or MDS/MPN); tMDS/AML therapy-related myeloid neoplasms; CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia; MPD, myeloproliferative disease; MDS-U, myelodysplatic syndrome, unclassifiable; IPSS, International Prognostic Scoring System.
Train_Line_4959 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4960 Two pairs of primers covering exon 7 and exon 9 were designed using PrimerQuest software (Integrated DNA Technologies).
Train_Line_4961 By increasing the sequence depth and sensitivity by 3-fold for 96 patients, we identified only 4 patients with low-abundance TET2-mutant clones (RMA of between 3% and 6.3%), of whom 3 had no previously detectable mutations.
Train_Line_4962 N-terminal mutations lead to a nonfunctional 20 kD C/EBPalpha isoform or a shorter additional isoform while the physiological 30 kD isoform generated from an internal translational start site is always preserved (Fig 3A and B).
Train_Line_4963 The phenotype of the W mouse (characterised by white spotting of the coat, anaemia, lack of mast cells and infertility) and many subsequent studies on human tissues demonstrated the key functional role of KIT and its ligand, Stem Cell Factor (SCF) in haemopoiesis, melanogenesis and fertility (especially spermatogenesis).
Train_Line_4964 Forty-six (94%) patients with LT were dead at last follow-up, including six (85%) of seven that had undergone allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_4965 Notably, a 24-bp deletion starting at amino acid residue P95 was found in 3 patients.
Train_Line_4966 GENE SET ENRICHMENT AND DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_4967 No survival differences were found between the patients with and without U2AF1 mutation in the higher risk groups or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients (Supporting Information Fig. 2B-E).
Train_Line_4968 The exact mechanisms of ASXL1 mutant MPN are less well known, though recent studies have suggested a critical role in mediating PRC2 function, likely due to its role in recruitment of the PRC2 complex.
Train_Line_4969 Patients.
Train_Line_4970 Furthermore, in univariate analysis for event-free survival, IPSS score (high/int-2 versus low/int-1; HR 2.00; 95% CI 1.39-2.86; P<0.001), transfusion dependence (dependent versus independent; HR 2.29; 95% CI 1.46-3.52; P<0.001), and karyotype (high versus intermediate versus low risk; HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.33-2.12; P<0.001) were identified as prognostic factors for event-free survival.
Train_Line_4971 For additional information on the genomic characterization of myeloid neoplasms, the reader is referred to recent landmark studies of genomic and epigenomic landscapes of AML, and a review article in Blood.
Train_Line_4972 This finding suggests that JAK2V617F may at least partially overcome the mechanisms which induce the megaloblastoid maturation defects of sideroblastic erythropoiesis in RARS-T.
Train_Line_4973 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_4974 Early response assessment may be required in investigational studies to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy of a novel agent, or to guide subsequent treatment, for example, with protocols applying intensified induction regimens.
Train_Line_4975 This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board.
Train_Line_4976 Analyses were performed using the Stata SE Version 11.2 software (StataCorp LP; http://www.stata.com).
Train_Line_4977 CLINICAL OUTCOME IN THE TOTAL COHORT OF PATIENTS WITH AML ACCORDING TO DNMT3A MUTATION STATUS.
Train_Line_4978 Briefly, lysates of 1 x 106 leukemic cells were run on 4%-15% Mini-Protean TGX gradient gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with an anti-BCOR mouse polyclonal Ab (ab88112; Abcam), an anti-beta-tubulin (clone TUB 2.1; Sigma-Aldrich), or an anti- NPM1 mouse mAb (produced in B.F.'s laboratory) as loading control.
Train_Line_4979 Specifically, although the IPSS treats all patients with a platelet count less than 100 x 109/L equally, the LR-PSS assigns added risk to patients with more severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50 x 109/L), while decreasing the prognostic impact of excess blasts.
Train_Line_4980 Differences in global DNA methylation have been associated with differences in treatment outcome for patients with AML.
Train_Line_4981 Myelodysplastic hematopoiesis is characterized by excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic precursors, at least in patients with low-risk disease.
Train_Line_4982 However, there was no difference in the incidence of any mutation between patients with and without WT1 mutation (supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Train_Line_4983 The concept of cotranscriptional splicing is represented schematically in Figure 2.
Train_Line_4984 * Combination of kinase inhibitors with agents targeting cell survival mechanisms and/or synergistic signalling pathways offers considerable promise.
Train_Line_4985 However, the incidence of SRSF2 mutation was similar between patients with lower risk MDS (refractory anemia [RA] and RA with ring sideroblasts [RARS], 10.2%) and higher risk MDS (RA with excess blasts and RA with excess blasts in transformation, 13.7%).
Train_Line_4986 In most cases, SH2B3 PH domain mutations identified in MPN patients are heterozygous (Oh et al 2010a,b; Pardanani et al 2010) suggesting that SH2B3 haploinsufficiency is sufficient to contribute to MPN pathogenesis.
Train_Line_4987 We sequenced all coding exons of DNMT3A using DNA from bone marrow and paired normal cells from 150 patients with MDS and identified 13 heterozygous mutations with predicted translational consequences in 12/150 patients (8.0%).
Train_Line_4988 As demonstrated by Tartaglia et al., such mutations modify the zone of interaction between N-SH2 and PTPase domains and release enzymatic activity of SHP-2.
Train_Line_4989 Fig 3. Predicted cumulative incidence of relapse of patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving high-dose cytarabine (HDAC) and low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) postremission therapy according to RAS mutation status (mutated or wild-type) adjusting for core binding factor status. (A) Patients with RAS mutation. Model was based on 22 patients on the HDAC arm and 12 patients on the LDAC arm. (B) Patients with wild-type RAS. Model was based on 95 patients on the HDAC arm and 56 patients on the LDAC arm.
Train_Line_4990 Cancer stem cells and resistance to inhibitor therapy.
Train_Line_4991 ASXL1 mutations are more common than EZH2 mutations in all three MPNs, and occur in 5-25% of PV, 5-10% of ET, and 13-23% of PMF patients.
Train_Line_4992 The predictive value of the mutational prognostic schema was independent of risk with respect to treatment-related death (defined as death within 30 days after initiation of treatment) or lack of response to induction chemotherapy (i.e., lack of a complete remission) in the test cohort and in the combined test and validation cohorts (Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_4993 Surprisingly, some of these established molecular markers in MDS lost their significance from the univariate in the subsequent multivariate analysis for OS such as TP53 mutations (Figure 4C and supplemental Table 8).
Train_Line_4994 Figure 1. Localization of mutations identified in splice genes. Each mutation is shown with a circle. F represents confirmed somatic mutations; and colored boxes, known domain structures. ZN indicates zinc finger; RRM, RNA recognition motif; RS, arginine-serine-rich domain; and HD, HEAT domain.
Train_Line_4995 Although the two studies used different approaches to identify the CALR mutations, the findings from these two studies provide strong genetic evidence that CALR mutations have an important role in the pathogenesis of these disorders.
Train_Line_4996 In this work, we performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of SF3B1 in patients with myelodysplastic neoplasms to define the clinical correlates of these mutations.
Train_Line_4997 In the present study we found that IDH1 mutations were a recurring molecular aberration in MDS patients, occurring with a frequency of 3.6%.
Train_Line_4998 Granulocyte transfusion.
Train_Line_4999 Random hexamer priming and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were used to generate cDNA.
Train_Line_5000 Of note, in these patients, the 2-year OS was 50% with azacitidine compared with 16% with conventional treatment regimens.
Train_Line_5001 Of note, mutations in DDX41 (R525H) altered the native DDX41 interactome especially for major components in U2 (SF3B1, SF3B2, and SF3B3) and U5 (PRPF8 and SNRNP200) spliceosomes (Figure 5B).
Train_Line_5002 We analysed the incidence and impact of TP53 gene mutations in a large cohort of MDS patients using next generation sequencing (Roche 454 FLX; Roche, Branford, CT, USA) and array-based genomic profiling, in order to determine the correlation of the mutation to the clinical phenotype, karyotype, prognosis, its association with other gene mutations and impact of 5-azacitidine on mutated clones.
Train_Line_5003 A variety of novel mutations have been catalogued in recent years and this is largely due to the advent of increasingly sensitive techniques, including whole genome sequencing (Mardis et al 2009; Walter et al 2009).
Train_Line_5004 A total of 10 x 106 cells were diluted in PBS 100 ml and injected subcutaneously into the flank of 8-week-old NOD scid gamma mice (NSG) mice.
Train_Line_5005 ASXL1 mutations in disease outcome.
Train_Line_5006 The X2 test or Fisher exact test was performed to calculate the significance of association between SRSF2 mutation and other parameters of discrete variables, including sex, FAB subtypes, WHO classification, karyotypes, International Prognosis Scoring System (IPSS) scores, and mutations of other genes.
Train_Line_5007 Mutation analysis.
Train_Line_5008 Intriguingly, despite a long follow-up with analysis of sequential samples, patients without TP53 mutation (n = 41) did not acquire a mutation during the disease course although a significant proportion (45%) had leukaemic progression.
Train_Line_5009 Importantly, ASXL1 mutations were equally distributed between the different treatment groups, and ASXL1 frameshift mutations conferred a dismal prognosis in lenalidomide-treated or ATG-treated patients, which suggests that the prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations is independent of the treatments applied to our patients.
Train_Line_5010 For example, patients without FLT3-ITD mutations and with both mutant NPM1 and IDH represent a favorable-risk subset defined by a specific mutational genotype, whereas patients who were negative for FLT3-ITD mutations and had mutant NPM1 without concurrent IDH mutations had a much less favorable outcome - particularly if those patients had concurrent mutations associated with an unfavorable-risk profile
Train_Line_5011 Knockdown of Brcc3 in normal hematopoietic cells resulted in the modest increase of colony formation and slightly less differentiation compared to WT experiments, which might support the evidence of the tumorigenic effects of human BRCC3 mutations.
Train_Line_5012 Potentially useful applications of MRD monitoring include early assessment of response to therapy to improve risk stratification and guide postremission therapy; and posttreatment monitoring to detect impending relapse and guide preemptive therapy.
Train_Line_5013 However, a significantly shorter event-free survival was observed in BCOR-mutated patients (n = 10 vs n = 252; event-free survival at 2 years, 0% vs 38.3%; P = .014; supplemental Table 13).
Train_Line_5014 Mutations in the ASXL1 (additional sex combs like 1) gene were first reported in 2009 in myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_5015 BCOR mutations were scattered across the whole length of the coding sequence and included 6 nonsense mutations, 15 small frame-shift insertions/deletions (one of which was observed in 2 patients), and 4 mutations of consensus splice-sites (2 of which targeted the same splice-site in 2 distinct patients; Figure 2 and Table 2).
Train_Line_5016 Hemizygous deletions of the IKZF1 gene region on chromosome 7p were observed in 1 of 437 patients with chronic-phase MPN and 6 of 29 patients with post-MPN-AML.
Train_Line_5017 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_5018 Patients with mutated SRSF2, but not U2AF1 or ZRSR2, were found to have a higher transformation rate to AML (P = .013).
Train_Line_5019 Consistent with these findings, patient 2306 was homozygous for SNPs within the TET2 coding region, according to the sequencing data (not shown).
Train_Line_5020 The Stat View (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) statistical package was used for all calculations.
Train_Line_5021 In the time since Dr. Rowley's discovery, a multitude of additional recurrent somatic mutations and fusion proteins have been discovered.
Train_Line_5022 The negative prognostic impact of TP53 mutations in MDS has been suggested in a number of reports, but small sample size, lack of in-depth analysis and use of conventional Sanger sequencing techniques with relatively low sensitivity has not provided a precise incidence and role for TP53 mutations (Lai et al 1995; Christiansen et al 2001; Bowen et al 2009; Jasek et al 2010).
Train_Line_5023 Alternatively, the existence of yet undefined cooperating mutations, particularly in patients with TP53 mutations could be deciphered by whole genome sequencing, as emerging data indicate multiple genetic alterations and epigenetic deregulations usually cooperate for MDS disease biogenesis and progression (Walter et al 2012).
Train_Line_5024 In this study, IDH mutations were identified in 4.6% of 477 patients with MDS based on the FAB classification and in 2.2 % of 368 patients based on the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_5025 Lentiviral expression vector (pLX304, clone ID: HsCD00442077; DNASU Plasmid Repository) was used to generate viral supernatants.
Train_Line_5026 The impact of WT1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is not completely settled.
Train_Line_5027 Whether this is counteracted by the negative impact of concurrent Flt3-ITD mutations is controversial.
Train_Line_5028 Technical details about sample processing and data analyses for single nucleotide polymorphism-array (SNP-A) have been previously described.
Train_Line_5029 Furthermore, some such patients if particularly healthy might be candidates for more aggressive consolidation including moderate-dose cytarabine.
Train_Line_5030 A subnormal serum Epo level in the absence of JAK2V617F mandates additional mutational analysis for JAK2 exon 12 mutation to capture some of the approximately 3% of PV patients who are JAK2V617F-negative.
Train_Line_5031 Figure 3. Schematic representation of our current knowledge of genotype/phenotype relationships in MDS, MDS/MPN, and a related MPN like CNL. The SF3B1 mutation is strictly associated with RARS, whereas the combination of the SF3B1 mutation with subclonal driver mutations in JAK2 or MPL is associated with RARS-T. Thus far, no conclusive genotype/phenotype relationship has been defined within refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia. Various combinations of founding and subclonal driver mutations can be found in RCMD and RAEB. CMML has a relatively well-defined molecular basis, involving primarily somatic mutations of TET2 and SRSF2: comutation of these genes is almost invariably associated with CMML, whereas the ASXL1 mutation involves poor outcome. Within MDS/MPN, aCML is characterized by various founding mutations plus a subclonal mutation of SETBP1. Activating mutations of CSF3R are strictly associated with CNL.
Train_Line_5032 For most patients with high-risk cytogenetics, outcome remains dismal with conventional consolidation therapy.
Train_Line_5033 The nucleotide numberings are according to NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_024426.
Train_Line_5034 TET2 mutations in the 355 MDS patient cohort.
Train_Line_5035 In this study, we showed the incidence of WT1 mutations was 6.8% for total de novo non-M3 AML patients, and 7.0% and 8.3%, respectively, for patients with CN-AML of all age groups and those younger than 60 years.
Train_Line_5036 These MPL mutations have been found in up to 15% of JAK2 V617F-negative ET or PMF.
Train_Line_5037 Cancer initiation and progression is caused by genetic and epigenetic alterations in DNA.
Train_Line_5038 There was no statistically significant difference, among the three mutation groups (SRSF2 vs. SF3B1 vs. U2AF35), in prognostically relevant parameters, including gender distribution, median age, hemoglobin values, absolute neutrophil counts (ANC), absolute monocyte counts (AMC), platelet counts, PB, and BM blast counts, WHO histological subcategories (CMML-1 vs. CMML-2), and circulating immature myeloid cells.
Train_Line_5039 Cell samples from 193 patients with MDS were collected at time of enrollment on clinical trials.
Train_Line_5040 Cytogenetic and mutational analyses.
Train_Line_5041 Previous studies have suggested that CALR can regulate STAT signaling pathways, and Klampfl et al found that expression of mutant (but not nonmutant) CALR can activate STAT signaling in hematopoietic cells.
Train_Line_5042 For TP53 mutations, which were strongly associated with complex karyotype, nonmyeloablative conditioning, and unrelated donor, the HR of death decreased (HR, 2.30; P = .027) yet remained significant.
Train_Line_5043 Somatically acquired mutations have been identified in several genes, for example, the NPM1 gene, the FLT3 gene, the CEBPA gene, the myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia (trithorax homolog, Drosophila) (MLL) gene, the neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) gene, the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene, the v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) gene, the runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) gene, the tet oncogene family member 2 (TET2) gene, and the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (NADP+), soluble (IDH1) gene.
Train_Line_5044 PRC2 methylates histone H3 at lysine 27, a mark of inactive chromatin, through the SET domain of EZH1 or EZH2.
Train_Line_5045 Identification of somatic mutations in the MDS index patient.
Train_Line_5046 Subsequent analysis has shown that constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is an important pathogenetic event in these patients, and that enzymatic inhibition of JAK2V617F may be of therapeutic benefit in this context.
Train_Line_5047 Among CK+/MK+ AMLs, those with TP53 alterations had significantly worse OS (P = .0004; Figure 4).
Train_Line_5048 Several MPNs are the result of a genetic event leading to the constitutive activation of a tyrosine kinase that mimics the intracellular signaling pathways induced by hematopoietic growth factors.
Train_Line_5049 Global methylation of CpG islands was assessed by using the Imprint Methylated DNA Quantification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany) in bone marrow samples from randomly selected patients with ASXL1 mutation (n=10) or wild-type MDS (n=10) and in peripheral-blood samples from healthy volunteers (n = 10).
Train_Line_5050 Tumor DNA was extracted from patient BM mononuclear cells.
Train_Line_5051 CALR molecular characterization may become a key component of the clinical management of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_5052 The gene BCOR, located on chromosome Xp11.4, encodes a corepressor of BCL6, a POZ/zinc finger transcription repressor that is required for germinal center formation and may influence apoptosis.
Train_Line_5053 Hsp90 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials in GIST.
Train_Line_5054 Relapse of a patient with a tertiary mutation in the activation loop of KIT was reported during sunitinib treatment following relapse on imatinib due to V654A mutation.
Train_Line_5055 Changes in treatment which may be made based on the identification of these mutations includes use of dose-escalated daunorubicin (90 mg/m2) during induction for DNMT3A and MLL mutant AML.
Train_Line_5056 In contrast, recent studies have suggested a greater than 50% response rate in PV-associated pruritus treated with paroxetine (20 mg/day), which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Train_Line_5057 Indeed, DDX41 defects were associated with advanced disease and poor prognosis.
Train_Line_5058 Nonetheless, the existence of SETD2 mutations in a range of hematopoietic malignancies as well as non-hematopoietic malignancies suggests that the SETD2-H3K36me3 pathway may be a common tumor-suppressive mechanism for cancer, thereby offering a new opportunity for the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.
Train_Line_5059 However, there was no prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation on the MDS patients with higher-risk MDS based on the FAB/WHO classification, IPSS-R or poor-risk cytogenetics.
Train_Line_5060 In RARS-T patients, the mutant allele burden ranged from 17% to 62% (median, 41%), and was not significantly different from that of other WHO categories with ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_5061 Two demethylating agents, the cytosine analogs azacitidine and decitabine, have been approved for the treatment of MDS, azacitidine by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) and decitabine by the FDA.
Train_Line_5062 In a multivariate Cox model with a stepwise variable-selection procedure using prognostic factors including age, IPSS, karyotype, and mutational status of IDH1/2, NRAS, RUNX1, ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2 (Supporting Information Table S3), IDH mutation was not an independent poor prognostic factors for OS, probably because its close association with older age, an independent poor prognostic factor.
Train_Line_5063 UPN indicates unique patient number; and --, negative (not mutated).
Train_Line_5064 SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels were assessed in granulocytes and/or mononuclear cells from 34 IMF patients of whom 15 carried a JAK2 V617F mutation and one carried a MPL W515L mutation.
Train_Line_5065 Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are present in 5% to 30% of adults with AML overall.
Train_Line_5066 However, the identification of frequent somatic mutations in the epigenetic modifiers described here has informed several novel potential therapeutic approaches in the treatment of AML.
Train_Line_5067 Four patients showed a marked decrease in clone size, both in patients with single mutation (24-3%, 78-15%) and also in cases with double mutant clone (40:41-%5:6%; 35:40%-8%; 17%) associated with cytogenetic remission.
Train_Line_5068 C/EBPalpha possesses the ability to arrest cell proliferation in addition to its ability to drive terminal differentiation and thereby functions as a master switch between proliferating uncommitted and cell cycle-arrested differentiated cells.
Train_Line_5069 A dilution series of 0%, 1%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% control methylated DNA, diluted with unmethylated DNA, was prepared.
Train_Line_5070 Final model obtained from backward-elimination selection algorithm candidates included variables with univariable P <.20.
Train_Line_5071 Recurrent losses were identified for the following chromosomes: monosomy 5 or losses of 5q (-5/5q-) (n = 147; 63%), -7/7q- (n = 123; 53%), -17/17p- (n = 106; 45%), -16/16q- (n = 66; 28%), -18/18q-, -12/12p- (n = 65 each; 28%), -20/20q- (n = 55; 24%), -3/3p- (n = 54; 23%), and -11/11q- (n = 35; 15%).
Train_Line_5072 There were no obvious associations between SRSF2 mutation and the cytogenetic groups, IPSS risk groups, or WHO subgroups (Table 1).
Train_Line_5073 Similarly, the incidence of AML in patients treated with hydroxyurea, when compared with a historical control treated with either chlorambucil or radiophosphorus, was significantly lower (5.9% vs. 10.6% vs. 8.3%, respectively, in the first 11 years of treatment).
Train_Line_5074 Somatic insertions or deletions in exon 9 of CALR were detected in all patients who underwent whole-exome sequencing.
Train_Line_5075 This could also be the case for other patients with multiple mutations that differ significantly in frequency from each other (see above).
Train_Line_5076 Whole-exome sequencing identifies somatic mutations of BCOR in acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype.
Train_Line_5077 The mutated genes identified in the index patient (Table 1) included DNMT3A, which has been previously reported to be mutated in AML, and 3 additional genes, BCOR, YY2, and SSRP1, which we selected for further mutational screening because of their biologic functions and/or putative implication in AML pathogenesis.
Train_Line_5078 A similar strategy in PV revealed median survivals of ~23 and 9 years in the absence of advanced age and leukocytosis or presence of both risk factors, respectively.
Train_Line_5079 Management of Low-Risk PV or ET, in the Absence of Extreme Thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_5080 The hallmark of these disorders is an increased production of mature blood cells.
Train_Line_5081 Analysis of KIT mutations in individual patients is an essential prerequisite to the use of kinase inhibitors for therapy, and monitoring for development of secondary mutations that confer drug resistance is necessary.
Train_Line_5082 C-terminal mutations are usually located at the junction between the basic region and the leucine zipper coding sequence resulting in impaired alignment with the major groove of DNA and disturbed DNA binding by the mutant protein as well as altered dimerization with its partner proteins.
Train_Line_5083 RESULTS.
Train_Line_5084 Summary of randomized studies in PV.
Train_Line_5085 Nuclear protein extracts (~10 mg of protein) were transferred to tubes with antibody-bound protein G beads and rocked gently at 4--degrees--C overnight.
Train_Line_5086 Four hundred and seventy-eight adult patients with de novo MDS diagnosed according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria at the National Taiwan University (BM) studies at diagnosis and had adequate cryopreserved BM cells for gene analyses were recruited into the study.
Train_Line_5087 TET1 and 2 proteins appear to play a crucial role in stem cell biology as shown in the control of pluripotency of murine embryonic stem cells.
Train_Line_5088 The Casitas B-cell lymphoma (CBL) family includes 3 homologs: c-CBL, CBL-b, and CBL-c.
Train_Line_5089 Twelve patients who were found to have mutant TET2 clones within their bone marrow tissue were also screened for mutation status within paired germline (skin), CD34+, and CD3+ T-cell tissue, where available.
Train_Line_5090 U2AF1 mutation was an independent poor-risk factor for overall survival (OS) in all patients (P = 0.030) and younger patients (P = 0.041).
Train_Line_5091 IDH mutations were detected in 34 (12%) cases: 26 IDH2 and 8 IDH1.
Train_Line_5092 By Fisher exact test.
Train_Line_5093 Likewise, the proportion of patients ultimately classified as having a favorable-risk AML profile increased from 19% to 26% (3-year rate of overall survival, 64%), and the proportion of patients classified as having an unfavorable-risk profile increased from 18% to 39% (3-year rate of overall survival, 12%).
Train_Line_5094 In a similar multivariable analysis, mutant IDH1 was the only variable associated with shortened leukemia-free survival (P = 0.001; hazard ration 7.0, 95% confidence interval 2.3- 20.8).
Train_Line_5095 The aim of phase 1 was to establish the frequency of BCOR mutations in AML patients that have genetic features similar to those of the AML index patient: a normal karyotype in the absence of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD mutations, and MLL-PTD (supplemental Table 11).
Train_Line_5096 Our results are consistent with in vitro data showing that mutations in RAS render tumor cell lines derived from AML and non- small-cell lung and colon carcinomas more sensitive to certain cytotoxic drugs, such as cytarabine or topoisomerase II inhibitors.
Train_Line_5097 Our study also provides evidence that mutations of codons R140 and R172 of IDH2 occur in patients with AML arising from MDS.
Train_Line_5098 SF3B1 (exons 12-16), SRSF2 (exon2), ZRSR2 (exons 1-11), and U2AF35 (exons 2 and 6) were amplified using intron-flanking primers tagged with M13 universal primers at the 3' or 5' ends.
Train_Line_5099 In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%.
Train_Line_5100 The membrane was probed with monoclonal mouse alpha-GATA2 (CG2-96) antibody (Cat. No. sc-267; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), and detection was performed as described above.
Train_Line_5101 EZH2 mutations are not observed in ET, but are seen in 3% of PV and 13% of MF.
Train_Line_5102 CMML is further subclassified into CMML-1 (<5% circulating blasts and <10% BM blasts) and CMML-2 (5-19% circulating blasts, 10-19% BM blasts, or when Auer rods are present irrespective of the blast count), with the median over-all survival (OS) being ~20 and 15 months respectively.
Train_Line_5103 SRSF2-mut patients clustered in RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 subtypes and exhibited pronounced thrombocytopenias.
Train_Line_5104 The CSF1R (M-CSFR) promoter was PCR amplified and cloned into pGL4.12[luc2CP] (SfiI) (see Supplementary Table 9 for the PCR primers used).
Train_Line_5105 Another prediction of the model is that > 95% of the JAK2V617F clones die by exhaustion and disappear.
Train_Line_5106 Multivariate analysis revealed an inferior overall survival and a higher AML transformation rate for the genotype ZRSR2-mut/TET2-wt (overall survival: hazard ratio=.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.7; P=006; AML transformation: hazard ratio=.6; 95% CI, 2-4.2; P=026).
Train_Line_5107 C/EBPalpha and Proliferation Arrest.
Train_Line_5108 The percentage of WT1 mutations in exons 7 and 9 in whole cohort in this study was 6.8%.
Train_Line_5109 In contrast to SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF35, mutations in ZRSR2 were spread over the entire coding region and were mainly frameshift, splice site, or nonsense mutations (17 of 25, 68%).
Train_Line_5110 There are several exciting candidates which could be targeted together with KIT, especially in the context of more rapid and extensive reduction of tumour burden.
Train_Line_5111 Approximately 1 mug of total RNA was reverse transcribed as described elsewhere.
Train_Line_5112 Moreover, loss-of-function point mutations in SETD2 were recurrent (6.2%) in 241 patients with acute leukemia and were associated with multiple major chromosomal aberrations.
Train_Line_5113 Involvement in Chromosomal Translocations (B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia).
Train_Line_5114 [END OF SUMMERY (ABSTRACT)].
Train_Line_5115 Sanger sequencing confirmation was performed in all cases where the mutation had a RMA of >= 25%.
Train_Line_5116 In contrast, SRSF2-mut patients presented with substantially decreased numbers of neutrophil granulocytes (median: 1.1 vs 2.3 x 109/L; P = .006) and platelets (median: 88 vs 165 x 109/L; P < .001), whereas no differences for hemoglobin levels were observed.
Train_Line_5117 MUTATIONS ENRICHED IN BLAST PHASE MPN.
Train_Line_5118 There was a marginally significant male dominance of mutation frequency [odds ratio (OR) = 2.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84-4.73] (Table 2).
Train_Line_5119 When we tested a previously described helicase inhibitor, compound 8 (C14H15N3O) (Radi et al, 2012) in the lentiviral-induced knockdown model in vitro, in the range of 1 to 10 mM, knockdown cells displayed increased susceptibility to C14H15N3O inhibition compared to mock-transduced controls (Figures S5I-S5K).

Train_Line_5121 These observations suggest that SF3B1 mutations play a dominant but not exclusive role in the pathogenesis of RS.
Train_Line_5122 In the index family, father, son, and paternal grandmother were affected by de novo AML, while sAML from antecedent MDS (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB]) was diagnosed in a daughter.
Train_Line_5123 DNA from BM or PB was extracted using conventional methods.
Train_Line_5124 To the best of our knowledge, this study recruited the largest number of de novo adult AML patients for sequential analysis of WT1 mutations during clinical follow-ups.
Train_Line_5125 Other variables predicting for poor response to induction therapy were age (P < .0001) and genomic losses affecting 5q (P = .02), 7q (P = .03), and 16q (P = .04).
Train_Line_5126 In contrast, extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis was observed in the livers of MPLW515L animals, which was composed primarily of maturing erythroid elements with frequent atypical megakaryocytes and relatively fewer numbers of mature myeloid cells (Figure 4I and 4K).
Train_Line_5127 Amplicons were sequenced using BigDye chemistry and analyzed on an ABI 3730 sequencer.
Train_Line_5128 Somatic Gene Mutations.
Train_Line_5129 Chromosome banding analysis and FISH were performed as described previously.
Train_Line_5130 Pairwise comparisons were performed by Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and by two-sided Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.
Train_Line_5131 Design and Methods.
Train_Line_5132 Differences in the distribution of continuous variables between categories were analyzed by either Mann-Whitney (for comparison of two groups) or Kruskal-Wallis (comparison of three or more groups) test.
Train_Line_5133 We, therefore, analyzed other genes in these complexes in 149 cases and observed mutations in 3 patients (2.7%) (Online Supplementary Table S3).
Train_Line_5134 A combination of clinical and molecular factors is likely needed to most accurately define prognosis.
Train_Line_5135 Table 3. Relationship of BCOR disruptive mutations with NPM1, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, and RUNX1 mutations.
Train_Line_5136 The available evidence indicates that SF3B1 mutations are specific for CLL among mature B-cell neoplasms, have a lower incidence in early stages of CLL, occur more commonly in advanced disease, and tend to be associated with poor prognosis.
Train_Line_5137 Conversely, other mutations such as TET2 or IDH mutations are occasionally seen in PV and ET.
Train_Line_5138 A distinct molecular pattern involving the epigenetic regulation of transcription and the splicing machinery was identified and associated with patient outcome.
Train_Line_5139 A trend for survival similar to that of CIR was also observed for the entire cohort of patients included in this analysis (Fig 1B).
Train_Line_5140 The mutations were located throughout its coding region.
Train_Line_5141 This establishes a relationship between SF3B1 mutations and expanded but ineffective erythropoiesis, which represents a distinctive feature of RARS within MDS.
Train_Line_5142 Genomic DNA was extracted from 5 to 10 x 106 BM cells using the DNAzol kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_5143 Outcome of patients with TP53 mutation.
Train_Line_5144 The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutation and expression levels was evaluated in the context of other clinical and molecular prognostic markers.
Train_Line_5145 WT1 mutations were highly associated with t(7;11)(p15;p15) (P = .003), a chromosomal translocation resulting in fusion between NUP98 on 11p15 and HOXA9 on 7P15.
Train_Line_5146 Even the specimens with numerous large megakaryocytes always contained a MDS-like smaller subpopulation (Figures 1 H and J; 2C and H) in keeping with a MDS/MPD category which includes myeloid disorders that have both dysplastic and proliferative features.
Train_Line_5147 Calculation of risks, benefits, and timing of HSCT is often difficult in MDS.
Train_Line_5148 Thirty-six patients (7.5%) were found to have U2AF1 mutations, which occurred more frequently in younger patients (P = 0.033).
Train_Line_5149 Multiple studies have consistently identified that mutations in these genes have prognostic relevance, particularly in intermediate-risk AML patients, arguing for inclusion of mutational testing of these genetic abnormalities in routine clinical practice.
Train_Line_5150 Mutations in JAK2 and MPL have also been described in other diseases, such as acute leukemia, but they affect different amino acids and their frequency is lower than in MPNs.
Train_Line_5151 Mutation screening of the coding and intron-exon boundaries of WT1 exons 7 and 9 was performed using a direct sequencing method on DNA samples from 470 de novo AML patients.
Train_Line_5152 However, they were associated with shorter overall survival in patients with intermediate-risk AML.
Train_Line_5153 Six patients showed conversion of CGT to TGT leading to an Arg132Cys substitution and one patient had a CGT to CAT conversion leading to an Arg132His substitution (Table 1).
Train_Line_5154 Interestingly, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutations were mutually exclusive, with no patient having more than one of these genes affected (Table 1 and supplemental Tables 2 and 3).
Train_Line_5155 Thirty patients (33%) with SRSF2 mutations had 1% BM RS, of which 58% had < 15% RS, 42% had 15-49% RS, while none of the patients had 50% RS.
Train_Line_5156 Patient DNA was amplified using the following PCR conditions: 95--degrees--C for 10 minutes and 39 cycles of 95--degrees--C for 1 minute, 56--degrees--C for 1 minute, and 72--degrees--C for 70 seconds, followed by 1 cycle of 72--degrees--C for 10 minutes.
Train_Line_5157 Splice gene mutations were detected in 95 of 221 patients.
Train_Line_5158 Clinical and hematologic findings.
Train_Line_5159 Ineffective hematopoiesis, ie, the premature intramedullary death oferythroblasts,immature granulocytes/monocytes, and megakaryocytes, is primarily responsible for the defective production of mature blood cells and peripheral blood cytopenia.
Train_Line_5160 Association of BCOR disruptive mutations with mutations of the transcription factor RUNX1, a key regulator of hematopoiesis (44.4% of patients), is also interesting and warrants further investigations.
Train_Line_5161 A smaller proportion of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies also harbor both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations; reported mutational frequencies are approximately 10% for AML, 5% for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 4% for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), 9% for MDS/MPN, 15% for post-MDS AML, 22% for post-MPN AML, 10% for post-MDS/MPN AML, 22% for del(5q)-associated high-risk MDS or AML and 4% for blast-phase chronic myelogenous leukemia (~4%).
Train_Line_5162 The final multivariable model included RAS mutation status, cytogenetic group, consolidation therapy, and the interaction of RAS mutation and consolidation therapy.
Train_Line_5163 However, RFS and CR rate were similar between patients with mutated versus wild-type DNMT3A (RFS, HR = 1.26; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.78, P = .2, Fig 1B; CR, 71 v 76%, respectively, P = .32).
Train_Line_5164 In patients with MDS or MDS/MPN, we found a close relationship between ring sideroblasts and SF3B1 mutations.
Train_Line_5165 Patients with DNMT3A mutations were older, had higher WBC and platelet counts, more often had a normal karyotype and mutations in NPM1, FLT3, and IDH1 genes, and had higher MLL5 expression levels as compared with patients with wild-type DNMT3A.
Train_Line_5166 METHODS.
Train_Line_5167 Using whole exome sequencing (WES), we found a recurrent germline mutation of DDX41 (c.419insGATG, p.D140fs) in the father, son, and daughter.
Train_Line_5168 Of these, the most extensively studied in AML is ASXL1.
Train_Line_5169 In fact, when we compared disease characteristics of FLT3-mutated MDS patients versus nonmutated patients, the only statistically significant difference between FLT3-mutated and FLT3-nonmutated patients was that MDS patients with FLT3 mutations were younger and tended to present as RAEB more frequently than MDS patients without FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_5170 In the current study, with a relatively large cohort, we aimed to define the clinical correlations of U2AF1 mutation in patients with MDS and examine the interactions of this mutation with other genetic alternations.
Train_Line_5171 SRSF2 mutations were studied sequentially in 173 samples from 66 patients, including 8 patients with SRSF2 mutation and 58 patients without mutation at diagnosis.
Train_Line_5172 There was no difference in the site or type of mutation for double mutation group.
Train_Line_5173 See also Figure S2 and Table S1.
Train_Line_5174 One hundred and forty-two patients who had serial BM studies during clinical follow-ups and had adequate cryopreserved BM cells were enrolled for sequential mutation analyses.
Train_Line_5175 Primers were designed for nested PCR and sequencing across bisulphite-treated DNA at TP53 promoter region -200 to +100, including untranslated exon 1 (NCBI GenBank, accession number X54156).
Train_Line_5176 Randomized studies in elderly patients achieving CR are biased because only a low proportion of the initial study cohort is randomized and the majority of these patients have intermediate- or favorable-risk cytogenetics and lack significant comorbidities.
Train_Line_5177 To study the incidence and prognostic impact of mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_5178 Epo stimulation of BaF3-E cells overexpressing either SH2B3 RE or a vector control resulted in similar levels of STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation.
Train_Line_5179 Although both founding and subclonal driver mutations have been shown to have prognostic significance, prospective clinical trials that include the molecular characterization of the patient's genome are now needed.
Train_Line_5180 When combining the German and Italian cohorts, a significant association between BCOR-disruptive mutations and a shorter overall survival (n = 26 vs n = 396; alive at 2 years, 25.6% vs 56.7%; P = .032; Figure 5A) and event-free survival (n = 26 vs n = 396; event-free survival at 2 years, 7.5% vs 41.4%; P = .015; Figure 5B) was detected.
Train_Line_5181 Similar enhancement of kinase inhibition is seen in cells expressing V560G KIT with the imatinib-related second generation inhibitor, nilotinib.

Train_Line_5183 RESULTS.
Train_Line_5184 To establish the role of mutations in predicting prognosis for lower-risk MDS, we calculated the LR-PSS and determined the mutation status of 22 genes in a cohort of 288 patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_5185 TP53 alterations were found in 59 of 75 (79%) CK+/molMK+ AMLs and in 105 of 159 (66%) CK+/molMK- AMLs (P = .07; Table 1).
Train_Line_5186 Leukemia in a pregnant woman bears an increased risk for abortion, intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal mortality.
Train_Line_5187 Of these, 71 TET2 mutations predicted to alter protein structure/function were identified in 39 of 320 (12%) MDS and 16 of 35 (46%) CMML patients (P < .001; Table 2; Figure 1).
Train_Line_5188 Of the remaining 6 mutations, SIFT uniformly predicted the mutations to be damaging (Table 2), whereas PolyPhen2 predicted all but one, S714C, to be damaging.

Train_Line_5190 The statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS Version 19.0 (SPSS).
Train_Line_5191 Small to large megakaryocytes with aberrant nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic and irregularly folded nuclei and dense clustering.
Train_Line_5192 Furthermore, they found that approximately half of WT1-mutated patients had double heterozygous mutations (15 of 35) or a homozygous mutation (2 of 35), in contrast to adults in whom most patients showed single heterozygous mutation (and current study).
Train_Line_5193 Figure 2. New mutations and epigenetic modifications in MPNs. Several genes mutated in MPN (black boxes) are implicated either in histone modifications or in DNA methylation control. (A) JAK2 activation phosphorylates histone H3Y41, leading to the exclusion of heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) from chromatin. In addition, mutant JAK2 phosphorylates PRMT5, thus impairing the methylation of histone H4 and H2A arginine residues. Both phosphorylations are expected to facilitate gene transcription or reduce gene repression. (B) EZH2 belongs to the PRC2 complex, which methylates H3K27 and may also recruit DNMTs. ASXL1 may belong to a complex (PR-DUB in Drosophila melanogaster) that deubiquitinates histone H2AK119, a function that antagonizes the effect of the PRC1 complex. Inactivation of both genes is expected to prevent transcriptional repression mediated by the PRC complexes. (C) TET2 converts DNA 5mC to 5hmC, thus playing a role in active DNA demethylation that would be associated with gene expression. Activation mutations of JAK2 and mutations impairing EZH2, ASXL1, and TET2 functions may result in the deregulation of both DNA methylation and chromatin structure, resulting in aberrant gene expression, gene activation, or failure of repression.

Train_Line_5195 Current information about clinical significance of IDH mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), their association with other genetic alterations and the stability during disease progression is limited.
Train_Line_5196 TP53 alterations were associated with older age, genomic complexity, specific chromosome abnormalities, monosomal karyotype, specific CNAs, and predicted for dismal outcome.
Train_Line_5197 All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 18 software (IBM).

Train_Line_5199 C/EBPalpha expression in cell lines led to growth inhibition.
Train_Line_5200 Genomic DNA was extracted from samples using the All Prep DNA/RNA Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Train_Line_5201 Samples were loaded onto the 10% acrylamide gels, electrophoresed and transferred onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham).
Train_Line_5202 Whether these observations are cell-line specific or represent a more general phenomenon in prostate epithelium remains to be seen.
Train_Line_5203 In this study, 34 (14.6%) of the 233 MDS patients were found to have SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_5204 We further examined protein structural alterations of SETD2 and the associated histone methylation of H3K36 in SETD2-mutated patients.
Train_Line_5205 Both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur in MDS, although some studies have reported a preponderance of IDH1 mutations, whereas others have shown the opposite.
Train_Line_5206 The same was also true if the analysis was performed only in the 171 MDS patients based on WHO classification.
Train_Line_5207 BM cells were harvested directly or after 1-3 days of unstimulated culture, and the metaphase chromosomes were banded by the Gbanding method as described earlier.
Train_Line_5208 It is proposed to bind in the "hinge" region of the KIT active site which is much less influenced by conformational changes associated with activation.
Train_Line_5209 Primary analysis was performed on OS and time to AML progression.
Train_Line_5210 DNA Sequence Analysis and Genotyping for MPLW515L.
Train_Line_5211 To identify mutations in exons 4 to 10 of TP53, denaturating highperformance liquid chromatography was performed as previously described.
Train_Line_5212 Conversely, patients with no genomic aberrations at the TET2 locus had a mutation frequency (RMA) consistent with heterozygosity.
Train_Line_5213 TP53 mutations are found in about 5% of patients with MDS, mainly in subjects with advanced disease, complex karyotype, abnormalities of chromosome 17, or deletions of chromosome 5 and 7.
Train_Line_5214 To identify gene mutations that might carry prognostic value, we compared the coding sequence of mononuclear bone marrow (BM) cells with T cells of an IPSS intermediate-1 MDS patient who progressed to AML 5 months after diagnosis and died 8 months later.
Train_Line_5215 Furthermore, 3.5% of the patients treated with chlorambucil developed large cell lymphoma and the incidence of gastrointestinal and skin cancer was increased in those patients treated with either chlorambucil or radiophosphorus.
Train_Line_5216 Table 1. Proportion of patients carrying somatic mutations of SF3B1 in the study population.
Train_Line_5217 MPL mutations cluster in exon 10, the most frequent being MPLW515L/K.
Train_Line_5218 In seven RARS-T patients we found an allelic ratio of <50%T at first presentation (range, 16 to 43).
Train_Line_5219 Frequently, BRCC3 mutations detected in our cohort occurred in nonsense and frameshift configurations associated with myelodysplastic phenotypes.
Train_Line_5220 Due to critical illness a bone marrow biopsy was not obtained to confirm the diagnosis of AML, and the patient died shortly thereafter.
Train_Line_5221 FLT3 mutations were identified in 13 (4.3%) CMML patients: 8 had FLT3-ITD mutation and 5 had FLT3-TKD mutation.
Train_Line_5222 Hb, hemoglobin; ANC, absolute neutrophil count; Plt, platelet count.
Train_Line_5223 A similar percentage (3%) developed the complication in another study involving ET patients.
Train_Line_5224 Although closely related to primary forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), MDS predominantly affects the elderly.
Train_Line_5225 THE FOUNDING MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_5226 Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of first diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death from any cause.
Train_Line_5227 In the last few years, several mutant genes have been detected in CMML patients, including TET2, ASXL1, CBL, RUNX1, and EZH2.
Train_Line_5228 Interestingly, TET2 mutations were found to be associated with reduced overall survival among patients with intermediate-risk AML.
Train_Line_5229 The extracellular juxtamembrane domain consisting of the fourth and fifth Ig-like loops is involved in correctly orienting receptor monomers and stabilising dimers induced by binding of dimeric SCF.
Train_Line_5230 TET2 is mutated in 20% to 25% of patients with MDS and in 50% to 60% of patients with CMML.
Train_Line_5231 Interestingly, these AML cases also clustered together with the C/EBPalpha mutant samples in the previously mentioned microarray analysis.
Train_Line_5232 Comparison of clinical characteristics between MDS patients with and without IDH mutations is shown in Table I.
Train_Line_5233 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by features overlapping between myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Train_Line_5234 Standardized time points are necessary if MRD monitoring is performed.
Train_Line_5235 There was a significant association of SF3B1 mutations with the presence of ring sideroblasts (P < .001) and of mutant allele burden with their proportion (P=002).
Train_Line_5236 Therefore, patients receiving postremission therapy on the 400-mg and 3-g cytarabine arms were combined into one high-dose cytarabine group (HDAC) for subsequent comparison of their CIR with that of patients who were in the 100-mg cytarabine arm, referred to as the low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) group.
Train_Line_5237 This finding suggests the existence of a pre-JAK2 clone, on the background of which 2 independent genetic events have occurred, one being the JAK2V617F mutation leading to a MPN and another one being a genetic alteration leading to leukemia.
Train_Line_5238 The WT1 gene is demonstrated to be overexpressed in various leukemias, particularly acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as other cancers, and thus is suggested to be an oncogene.
Train_Line_5239 All patients signed informed consents for sample collection in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_5240 The relative risk of death for the JAK2V617F-positive patients was 79% lower than that of the negative group (relative risk of JAK2V617F positive versus negative 0.205; 95% confidence interval: 0.044-0.958; p=0.044) paralleled by 5-year survival probabilities of 86% vs. 62% (Figure 5).
Train_Line_5241 Notably, our analyses showed that these protein-protein associations persisted after nuclease digestion of RNA.
Train_Line_5242 There were no differences in age, sex, WHO classification, karyotype, bone marrow blasts, hemoglobin, transfusion dependence, ferritin, IPSS score, or number of treatments between the patients with IDH1 mutations and those with the wild-type gene.
Train_Line_5243 The driver genes whose mutations are responsible for MDS (Table 3) are frequently mutated also in other myeloid neoplasms listed in Table 1.
Train_Line_5244 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_5245 The definition of founding and subclonal driver mutations might considerably improve prognostication of MDS and more generally clinical decision-making in this field.
Train_Line_5246 For cell-proliferation assays, 32D cells stably expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRA and MPLW515L were grown in RPMI/10% FBS and then incubated with appropriate concentrations of JAK Inhibitor I (Calbiochem, San Diego, California, United States) for 72 hours. 32D cells expressing MPLWT were grown in RPMI/10%FBS/mTPO in the presence of JAK Inhibitor I.
Train_Line_5247 In 8 samples from MDS patients with DNMT3A mutations, cDNA sequencing detected both the mutant and wildtype alleles, suggesting that both were expressed (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 3).
Train_Line_5248 Introduction.
Train_Line_5249 Systematic detection of ASXL1 mutations could thus help in the assessment of disease and should perhaps be implemented in routine practice, whether associated with already systematically-surveyed mutations (CEBPA, JAK2, FLT3, NPM1) or in upcoming systematic genome analyses.
Train_Line_5250 To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to evaluate the dynamic change of ASXL1 mutation during disease progression in MDS.
Train_Line_5251 Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations occur in the majority of patients with low-grade gliomas and are prognostically favorable in that context.
Train_Line_5252 First, mutations in recently identified epigenetic modifiers are enriched in adults with AML (ages 16 years old and above) compared with pediatric AML patients.
Train_Line_5253 A total of 309 samples from 133 patients were serially studied for WT1 mutations using both direct sequencing and GeneScan analysis, including 23 patients with WT1 mutations and 110 without mutation at diagnosis.
Train_Line_5254 Phenotypically, BRCC3 mutations were frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms and associated with -Y abnormality (odds ratio; 3.70, 1.25-11.0).
Train_Line_5255 In all three families p.Thr354Met segregated with disease, and no individuals had AML or MDS who did not also carry p.Thr354Met (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 2).
Train_Line_5256 Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival in MDS patients with low or intermediate-1 IPSS risk stratified according to SF3B1 mutation status. (A) OS. (B) EFS. Vertical tick-marks indicate right-censored patients.
Train_Line_5257 Furthermore, approximately one half of patients with the related myeloproliferative disorders (MPD), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF), carry the same mutation.
Train_Line_5258 Incorporation of the 3 gene mutations, including NPM1/FLT3-ITD, CEBPA double-mutation, and WT1, and age at diagnosis, which are closely associated with prognosis, into survival analyses can better stratify patients into different risk groups.
Train_Line_5259 A subset of these mutations is associated with thrombocytopenia, an important parameter in the LR-PSS, raising the possibility that the LR-PSS may capture the consequences of key mutations, thereby obviating the need for genetic analysis to determine prognosis in lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_5260 Second, LNK mutations can target several regions of the LNK gene, not only in the PH domain.
Train_Line_5261 Because all 36 mutation types cause a frameshift to alternative reading frame 1, the resulting mutant CALR proteins share a novel amino acid sequence at the C-terminal (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_5262 As previously described by Loh et al. in pediatric AML 7, monosomy 7 is frequently associated with PTPN11 mutations.
Train_Line_5263 Alternatively, as these mutations retain the SH2B3 N-terminal dimerization domain, they could act by binding and sequestering WT SH2B3, resulting in a dominant negative effect.
Train_Line_5264 Mouse ASXL2 has been identified as a regulator of bone mineral density and osteoclastogenesis and whereas ASXL1 represses, ASXL2 increases the expression of adipogenic genes.
Train_Line_5265 SETBP1 encodes a protein that binds the SET nuclear oncogene involved in DNA replication.

Train_Line_5267 Most studies on WT1 mutations were restricted to CN-AML, and sequential analyses to evaluate the stability of this gene mutation during the clinical course were limited to a small number of patients.
Train_Line_5268 No prognostic significance has been associated with TET2 mutations in MPN.
Train_Line_5269 Recently, mutations involving the spliceosome machinery have been described in patients with myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, CMML, MPN, and AML.
Train_Line_5270 Patients analyzed during remission lost the mutation (n = 5), whereas the mutation was again found at relapse in the one patient whom we investigated.
Train_Line_5271 Figure 5. Comprehensive Mutational Profiling for Risk Stratification and Clinical Management of AML. The use of mutational profiling delineates subgroups of patients with intermediate-risk AML, as defined according to cytogenetic analysis, who have markedly divergent prognoses and reassigns a substantial proportion of them to favorable-risk or unfavorable-risk categories (Panel A). In addition, mutational profiling identifies genetically defined subgroups of patients with AML who have improved outcomes with high-dose anthracycline induction chemotherapy (Panel B). OS denotes overall survival.
Train_Line_5272 Except for detection of Y44H in one patient, all mutations observed in SRSF2 affected amino acid residue P95 and were predominantly heterozygous missense mutations.
Train_Line_5273 The diagnosis of AML arising from MDS was based on history, cytogenetics and morphology.
Train_Line_5274 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_5275 The majority of mutations occurred in patients with CN-AML, and the negative prognostic effect of DNMT3A mutations was specifically seen in patients with CN-AML.
Train_Line_5276 All patients provided written informed consent.
Train_Line_5277 Natural products include spliceostatin A, pladienolide, and meayamycin, and small synthetic molecule modulators of splicing factor 3b include sudemycins.
Train_Line_5278 The prognostic impact of ASXL1 mutations was evaluated in patients with MDS for whom follow-up information was available (n = 154).
Train_Line_5279 One might also consider platelet-lowering agents (e.g. hydroxyurea) in such aspirin-refractory cases, but the target platelet count in this instance should be the level at which relief of symptoms is observed, and not necessarily 400 x 109/L.
Train_Line_5280 Aberrant CpG island hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a well recognized mechanism that can lead to tumorigenesis.
Train_Line_5281 Resistance due to secondary KIT mutation in drug-binding residues.
Train_Line_5282 Background.
Train_Line_5283 We could not find the treatment difference between the patients with ASXL1 mutations and those without ASXL1 mutations (data not shown).
Train_Line_5284 In general, the recommended therapy to lower WBC is hydroxyurea, given at dosages up to 50 to 60 mg/kg per day, until WBCs are less than 10-20 x 109/L.
Train_Line_5285 The patients with RARS had a low JAK2 allele burden (<10%), normal karyotype and low-to-normal platelet counts.
Train_Line_5286 Data for all molecular subsets are provided in Figures S1 and S2 and Tables S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Train_Line_5287 After DNA extraction from bone marrow or blood samples, exon 3 of PTPN11 was amplified as previously described.
Train_Line_5288 Somatic mutations in other cellular pathways.
Train_Line_5289 Karyotype risk groups according to Greenberg et al.
Train_Line_5290 Similarly, germline CEBPA and GATA2 mutations have been associated with AML and early-onset MDS/AML (Owen et al, 2008; Hahn et al, 2011).
Train_Line_5291 Our study showed 85% (90 of 106) of ASXL1-mutated patients had concurrent other gene alterations.
Train_Line_5292 Mutation analysis of IDH1 in MDS patients may become useful for risk and treatment stratification in the future.
Train_Line_5293 Prognostic impact of BCOR mutations.
Train_Line_5294 A total of 90 mutations were detected, with 82 being missense mutations, seven frameshift mutations, and one nonsense mutation (Data Supplement Figure S1).
Train_Line_5295 Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for OS in MDS patients stratified by ASXL1 mutation status: (a) in all MDS patients based on the FAB classification; (b) in all MDS patients based on the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_5296 Because the mutant SF3B1 protein alters transcription and splicing of several genes, deciphering gains and losses is extremely difficult.
Train_Line_5297 Three of these mutations were also associated with JMML.
Train_Line_5298 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms showing clonal hematopoiesis, aberrant differentiation, peripheral cytopenias, and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_5299 The development of MDS is considered to arise from accumulation of genetic aberrations, but few studies concerning the association of IDH mutations with other genetic alterations in the pathogenesis of MDS are reported.
Train_Line_5300 The study cohort included more low-risk (n = 96) than high-risk (n = 51) MDS patients.
Train_Line_5301 These results are unexpected because the TPO/MPL axis plays an important role in HSC self-renewal and quiescence in the BM niche.
Train_Line_5302 Consequently, Setd2 knockdown resulted in a significantly higher yield of total colonies in the multiple rounds of plating for Mll-Af9, Mll-PTD and Aml1-Eto knockin HSPCs (Fig. 4b).
Train_Line_5303 These data indicate that MPLW515L-mediated proliferation and activation of JAK-STAT signaling is sensitive to inhibition with a small molecule JAK kinase inhibitor.
Train_Line_5304 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_5305 In contrast, Dnmt3a-/-/Dnmt3b-/- KLS cells were unable to contribute to long-term hematopoiesis in a murine transplantation model, suggesting that either Dnmt3a-/- or Dnmt3b-/- is necessary to maintain hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal.
Train_Line_5306 Considering these data together, we propose an algorithm for the molecular workup of MDS (supplemental Figure 4).
Train_Line_5307 In cell culture assays, expression of MPLW515L, but not MPLWT, conferred cytokine-independent growth to 32D, UT7, or Ba/F3 cell lines (Figure 1C and unpublished data). Western blotting demonstrated constitutive phosphorylation of the JAK/STAT signaling proteins, including JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 (Figure 1D).
Train_Line_5308 However, there is also evidence to suggest that the opposite is true in some cases.
Train_Line_5309 The number of cases analyzed for each cohort is indicated in bold.
Train_Line_5310 To investigate the possibility that altered TP53 gene expression could also contribute to TP53 dysregulation in MDS, BM total mononuclear cells of patients with wild type (n = 12) or mutant TP53 (n = 12) were analysed for TP53 mRNA levels.
Train_Line_5311 P value from two-sided X2 tests for categorical variables and from two-sided Student's t or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for continuous variables.
Train_Line_5312 In summary, our results show that DNMT3A mutations are one of the most frequent molecular aberrations currently observed in AML.
Train_Line_5313 Thus far, in CMML, loss-of-function mutations involving EZH2 and ASXL1 have been associated with poor outcomes.
Train_Line_5314 Commonly used practice is to transfuse irradiated blood products from start of conditioning until 6 months after transplant (in the absence of chronic GVHD; allogeneic HSCT), and from 7 days before stem cell harvest until 3 months post transplant for autologous HSCT.
Train_Line_5315 Thus, these results demonstrate that SETD2 mutations are recurrent in acute human leukemia and are associated with chromosomal abnormalities that are known to be driver mutations in leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_5316 Therapeutic targeting of c-KIT in cancer.
Train_Line_5317 In a recently published series of RARS-T, JAK2V617F was amplified from a bone marrow smear of a patient with normal platelet counts who apparently developed RARS-T 5 years later.
Train_Line_5318 Mutations in ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, IDH1/2, and TET2, suggest deregulation of the epigenetic control of transcription.
Train_Line_5319 The association of TP53 alterations with CK+/MK+ AML was lost when TP53 alterations were correlated with CNAs identified by array-based assays.
Train_Line_5320 TP53 mutations occurred in 30 (9.4%) patients, exclusively in isolated del5q (19%) and complex karyotype (CK) with -5/5q-(72%), correlated with International Prognostic Scoring System intermediate-2/high, TP53 protein expression, higher blast count and leukaemic progression.

Train_Line_5322 Several studies, recently reviewed in Blood by Issa, have shown that MDS patients not only carry epigenetic effector mutations but also an abnormal epigenome.
Train_Line_5323 Prognosis is even worse when wild-type FLT3 allele is lost and FLT3-ITD mutations negate the positive influence expressed by NPM1 mutation.
Train_Line_5324 This is the only study, to-date, which randomized patients with ET to a drug versus no drug.
Train_Line_5325 It should be noted that SF3B1 mutations have not been detected so far in patients with polycythemia vera, whereas they have been identified in only 3% of those with essential thrombocythemia and in 7% of those with primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_5326 The overall incidence of TP53 mutations was 9.4% (30 of 318 patients).
Train_Line_5327 Although no BCOR mutations were identified in patients with AML-MRC, this disease entity exhibited the highest frequency of BCORL1 mutations, with 2 frameshift cases (2/22 = 9.1%; 95% CI, 2.5-27.8).
Train_Line_5328 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_5329 Animals transplanted with bone marrow that was transduced with MPLWT viral supernatant were killed at the time of manifestation of MPLW515L disease for endpoint analysis.
Train_Line_5330 Among the 362 patients with MDS according to the 2008 WHO classification, 17.1% patients had ASXL1 mutation.
Train_Line_5331 For multivariable analysis for CIR, RAS mutation (mutated v wild-type), consolidation therapy (HDAC v LDAC), percentage of bone marrow blasts, WBC count, cytogenetic group (CBF AML v non-CBF AML), and the interaction of RAS mutation and consolidation therapy fulfilled the inclusion criteria.
Train_Line_5332 In the chronic phase of classic MPN, c-CBL mutations have been found in a low percentage of PMF patients (6%) but were not detected in a small series of PV and ET patients.
Train_Line_5333 EDITORS' SUMMARY.
Train_Line_5334 Numerous studies have shown that myeloid growth factors, either GM-CSF or G-CSF, accelerate neutrophil recovery by 2 to 5 days, can reduce antibiotic use, duration of fever, and number of days spent in hospital, and do not retard platelet recovery, or have a detrimental effect by stimulation of leukemic cell growth.
Train_Line_5335 Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that TET2, ASXL1, and EZH2 mutations favor the occurrence of secondary genetic events.
Train_Line_5336 A similar situation occurs with targeting BCR/ABL in CML where complete elimination of the disease may fail due to the insensitivity of the leukaemic stem cell pool to kinase inhibitors and much can be learned from that experience.
Train_Line_5337 Four (40%) of the 10 patients with this cytogenetic abnormality showed concurrent WT1 mutation.
Train_Line_5338 CONCLUSION.
Train_Line_5339 Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the time (in months) between the date of diagnosis and the date of first event (death or leukemic transformation for cases having at least 1 of these events) or last follow-up (for censored patients).
Train_Line_5340 Mutation analysis of SOCS1 and SOCS3.
Train_Line_5341 In the context of large-scale efforts to sequence large portions of the genome, multiple recurrent somatic mutations have been discovered in genes responsible for epigenetic regulation.
Train_Line_5342 Also, evidence now appears overwhelming to document the role of C/EBPalpha as a bona fide tumor suppressor silenced in multiple different ways in a wide range of leukemias in which its mutational status and transcriptional signature has led to new diagnostic and prognostic classification schemes.
Train_Line_5343 Several genetic lesions have been found to be closely associated with CN-AML, including mutations in NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, and MLL-PTD.
Train_Line_5344 Distributions of 2008 WHO subtypes, IPSS risk groups, and cytogenetic risk groups are shown in Table 1 and in supplemental Tables 2-4.
Train_Line_5345 In addition, the white blood cells that remain are abnormal (that is, metaplastic).
Train_Line_5346 In the first step, all 23 exons of DNMT3A were completely sequenced in 40 patients (AML, n = 20; MDS, n = 20).
Train_Line_5347 I usually start pegylated IFN-a at 50 mcg once a week and titrate up to 180 mcg once a week if tolerated.
Train_Line_5348 The IPSS cytogenetics risk groups were 20 good, 3 intermediate and 28 poor-risk.
Train_Line_5349 Additional parameters that may significantly contribute to a refined risk assessment of MDS include gene expression profiling-based signatures.
Train_Line_5350 We next examined how these clinical and disease-related variables were associated with OS in our cohort.
Train_Line_5351 Screening of mutated genes in independent patient cohorts.
Train_Line_5352 In this study, the U2AF1 mutation was serially analyzed in a relatively large cohort and we found the mutation was stable during the disease progression.
Train_Line_5353 In conclusion, our study provides important mechanistic insights into the function of the newly identified SH2B3 PH domain mutants.
Train_Line_5354 JAK2V617F also occurs in ET and PMF with respective mutational frequencies of 55 and 65%.
Train_Line_5355 SOMATIC MUTATIONS OF SF3B1 IN PATIENTS WITH MYELOID NEOPLASMS.
Train_Line_5356 As an example, patient 2719 had an A/G SNP (nucleotide position 5284, rs2454206) that was found at 68% RMA, indicative of an LOH within a clonal mix (Figure 5A).
Train_Line_5357 Hence, it was likely that classic MPNs are also "kinase diseases."
Train_Line_5358 Patients with a somatic mutation of CALR had longer overall survival than those with a JAK2 or MPL mutation (P<0.001 for both comparisons), whereas no significant difference was observed between the latter two subgroups.
Train_Line_5359 Although TP53 mutation status was not associated with patient age (P = .60), 16 of the 18 patients with TP53-mutant disease in this study received reduced-intensity conditioning, and all but one had an unrelated donor (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_5360 Germline variants of DDX41 may convey a strong predisposition to MDS and subsequent AML and are likely to serve as a "first hit," or an ancestral event.
Train_Line_5361 Decreased TET2 expression is also noted in CD34+ cells, CD13+/33+ myelomonocytic cells, and CD71+ erythroid cells isolated from bone marrow, and mature granulocytes obtained from patients with no detectable mutations, suggesting alternative mechanisms of TET2 dysregulation.

Train_Line_5364 Cytogenetic analysis and mutation analysis of IDH1/2 and NPM1.
Train_Line_5365 Even after accounting for risk factors, such as cytogenetics, molecular genetics, type of AML (ie, de novo AML; AML with previous history of MDS or MDS/MPN; therapy-related AML), and performance status, older patients have worse outcomes than younger patients, suggesting the effect of unknown age-related factors.
Train_Line_5366 IDH mutations have been reported in 2-5% of MPN, and PMF patients harboring IDH mutations are associated with earlier transformation to AML and poor overall survival.
Train_Line_5367 Mice and cell culture Sh2b3-deficient 129/Sv mice were a generous gift from Dr. T. Pawson (Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Toronto, Canada; Velazquez et al 2002).
Train_Line_5368 The median SF3B1 mutant allele burden was approximately 40% (Figure 1), indicating that in most patients hematopoiesis was sustained by a dominant clone heterozygous for the mutation.
Train_Line_5369 In cytogenetically favorable CBF AML [ie, AML with t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16)], the presence of a KIT mutation has been shown to have an unfavorable influence on outcome in retrospective studies.
Train_Line_5370 However, such a prognostic analysis of gene mutations in MDS is not only challenged by the heterogeneity of the disease, but potentially also by the different treatment strategies used.
Train_Line_5371 These results further suggested that loss of DDX41 expression is associated with enhanced proliferative capacity in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_5372 Clinical Outcome.
Train_Line_5373 Further, to better stratify CN-AML patients into different risk groups, a simple scoring system integrating WT1 mutations with other gene alterations in survival analysis was proposed.
Train_Line_5374 The rate of survival among patients with intermediate-risk AML who had mutant FLT3-ITD and wild-type CEBPA, TET2, DNMT3A, and MLL-PTD did not differ significantly from the rate among patients with mutant FLT3-ITD and mutant CEBPA (P = 0.34), suggesting that the presence of mutations associated with an unfavorable-risk profile more precisely identifies patients with mutant FLT3-ITD who will have adverse outcomes of AML than does the absence of CEBPA mutations alone.
Train_Line_5375 In 91 patients, high-resolution Affymetrix SNP6 microarrays were used to detect cryptic genomic aberrations and their relationship to TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_5376 In univariate analyses, mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, SRSF2, U2AF1, and NRAS were associated with shorter overall survival; hazard ratios (HRs) are provided in Table 2 and survival curves are provided in the Data Supplement.
Train_Line_5377 The monitoring of MRD as determined by RT-PCR detecting leukemia-specific targets (eg, gene fusions, gene mutations, overexpressed genes), or by multiparameter flow cytometry identifying leukemia-associated aberrant phenotypes remains an active field of investigation.
Train_Line_5378 Number (%) of patients showing the specific gene mutation listed in the far left column among the SRSF2-wild or SRSF2-mutated group.
Train_Line_5379 Of 524 healthy study participants, 1 had a 3-bp in-frame deletion in CALR.
Train_Line_5380 Overall, patients with either DDX41 mutations or deletions had inferior overall survival (OS) (Figure 3C).
Train_Line_5381 However, these recently identified mutations are observed both in patients with mutated JAK2 or MPL and in those without these mutations; they are also seen in other myeloid cancers, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_5382 Several gain-of-function mutations of MPL have been found in exon 10, which result in the substitution of a tryptophan 515 to a leucine, lysine, asparagine, or alanine.
Train_Line_5383 In the ECOG E1900 trial, patients were randomly assigned to induction therapy with cytarabine plus either 45 mg of daunorubicin per square meter or 90 mg of daunorubicin per square meter.
Train_Line_5384 These findings were also reflected in the splenocyte populations examined from MPLW515L animals that revealed a nearly 10-fold increase in Mac1+/Gr1+ cells versus MPLWT spleens (Figure 5B, upper panels).
Train_Line_5385 Newer KIT inhibitors.
Train_Line_5386 - Balanced changes: t(11;16)(q23;p13.3); t(3;21)(q26.2;q22.1); t(1;3)(p36.3; q21.1); t(2;11)(p21;q23); t(5;12)(q33;p12); t(5;7)(q33;q11.2); t(5;17)(q33;p13); t(5; 10)(q33;q21); t(3;5)(q25;q34).
Train_Line_5387 GIST.
Train_Line_5388 They are rapidly induced by a broad spectrum of cytokines including erythropoietin, interleukin-3, and GM-CSF.
Train_Line_5389 If the comparison was made separately for these two groups, the mutation occurred more frequently in higher- than in lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_5390 Figure 2. BCOR disruptive mutations in AML. (A) Schematic representation of the BCOR protein and its domains. (B) Type and distribution of BCOR disruptive mutations (out-of-frame small indels are depicted as rectangles, nonsense mutations as ovals, and consensus splice-site mutations as [splice site mut.]) along the BCOR coding exons (numbered boxes with a width proportional to the exon nucleotide length) and the exon/intron junctions (short horizontal black lines before and after each exon). Mutations are shown above or below the exons based on whether they were observed in the German or Italian cohorts, respectively. The number 2 appended to the Arg1547X oval denotes that this mutation was found in 2 distinct patients of the German cohort. (C) Chromatograms of a representative clonal, somatic out-of-frame indel (delC) observed by direct DNA Sanger sequencing in the BM sample of a female AML patient at disease onset (containing approximately 70% blast cells), but not in her matched normal sample taken at the time of complete remission.
Train_Line_5391 Prognostic Schema with Integrated Mutational and Cytogenetic Profiling.
Train_Line_5392 This large single institution study confirms that TP53 mutations are an independent prognostic indicator of outcome in MDS.
Train_Line_5393 We speculate that aberrant protein partnerships may explain dominant negative activity and adversely influence expression of genes critical to myelopoiesis.
Train_Line_5394 International prognosis scoring system: Low, 0; Intermediate (INT)21, 0.5-1; INT-2, 1.5-2; and High, <=2.5.
Train_Line_5395 For variant detection, filters were set to display sequence alterations occurring in > 5% of bidirectional reads per amplicon in at least one patient.
Train_Line_5396 In this study, we performed LNK mutation analysis in 42 chronic-phase MPN patients to study additional mutations in human MPN.
Train_Line_5397 This study, however, was mainly focused on somatic mutations that are associated with unfavorable outcome and disease progression towardAML.
Train_Line_5398 DDX41 is exemplary of other RNA helicase genes also affected by somatic mutations, suggesting that they constitute a family of tumor suppressor genes.
Train_Line_5399 We did not observe CALR mutations in patients with polycythemia vera.
Train_Line_5400 On the other hand, only one (patient 107) of the 80 patients without ASXL1 mutation at diagnosis acquired novel ASXL1 mutation at the time of AML transformation.
Train_Line_5401 Although the definition of the term epigenetics has been a matter of debate, in this review, we refer to epigenetics as any process that directly affects modifications of DNA cytosine residues or posttranslational modifications of histones.
Train_Line_5402 Demographic and disease characteristics were compared between the 12 FLT3-mutated MDS patients and 1,220 FLT3-nonmutated MDS patients (Table I).
Train_Line_5403 However, ET patients carrying a MPL exon 10 mutation did show a significantly lower SOCS3 transcript level than JAK2 V617F-positive patients (p=0.0005; Figure 3B).
Train_Line_5404 In this study, we performed mutational analysis of exon 3 of the PTPN11 gene to assess the incidence of mutations in adult myeloid disorders.
Train_Line_5405 Nevertheless, mutations in EZH2 are highly significant predictors of overall survival, with an HR of >= 2.84 in all models, and the impact of EZH2 mutations is not captured by either the IPSS or LR-PSS.
Train_Line_5406 It was suggested that the association between SOCS3 promoter methylation and diminution of transcription is found specifically in JAK2V617F-negative patients with PMF.
Train_Line_5407 Other pretreatment characteristics were similarly distributed between the two groups (Table 1).
Train_Line_5408 We did not identify any IDH2 R172 or R140 mutations in MDS patients. However, we demonstrated that mutations of IDH2 occur in AML patients with a prior history of MDS.
Train_Line_5409 PCR products were purified, and a sequencing reaction was set up with the use of the BigDye Terminator, version 3.1, Cycle Sequencing Kit (Life Technologies).
Train_Line_5410 The universal involvement of Pro95 in SRSF2 mutation indicates a critical role of this residue on the protein function, which needs to be explored by further studies.
Train_Line_5411 Blasts display increased proliferative activity and harbor a normal karyotype similar to C/EBPalpha-mutant human AML.
Train_Line_5412 For male patients with mutations affecting genes located on the X chromosome (eg, BCOR, BCORL1, or STAG2), the quantified read count directly translated into the estimated cell frequency.
Train_Line_5413 FISH is frequently necessary to identify MLL fusion partners in 11q23 translocations.

Train_Line_5415 The diagnoses included refractory anemia (RA; n=67), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS; n=5), RA with excess blasts (RAEB; n=72), and RA with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T; n=6) (Table 1).
Train_Line_5416 The RARS-T patient carrying both an SF3B1 mutation and MPL (W515L) had a fully dominant clone that was heterozygous for both mutations.
Train_Line_5417 Further details are described (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_5418 11. Molecularly targeted therapy.
Train_Line_5419 One target located in the commonly deleted region of 17p13 is the tumor suppressor gene TP53.
Train_Line_5420 Cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells revealed a normal karyotype (46,XX) in 20 of 20 metaphases analyzed.
Train_Line_5421 The discovery of JAK2 and MPL gain-of-function mutations in classic MPN and the recapitulation of the human disorder in mouse models support this hypothesis.
Train_Line_5422 However, the temporal order of acquisition of driver mutations is not fixed and varies from subject to subject.
Train_Line_5423 We describe the frequency of various mutations and the prognostic usefulness and therapeutic relevance of integrated mutational profiling in 398 patients from the ECOG E1900 phase 3 clinical trial and the validation of these data in an independent cohort of 104 patients from the same trial.
Train_Line_5424 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by varying degree of cytopenia, usually a hypercellular and dysplastic bone marrow (BM) and a predisposition to develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_5425 However, p.Thr354Met dramatically reduced the ability of GATA2 to bind its consensus WGATAR DNA motif, and p.Thr355del almost completely ablated DNA binding (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Train_Line_5426 Within the cell populations assessed, only a proportion of cells carried a methylated SOCS3 promoter.
Train_Line_5427 Some members in each family carried this variant but were unaffected (pedigree 1, individuals III-5 and III-8; pedigree 2, individual II-6; and pedigree 3, individual III-9).
Train_Line_5428 In accordance with previous reports, we did not detect this alteration in genomic DNA from CD3+ cells of the same patients, when available.
Train_Line_5429 Inherited mutations in DNMT3B are the most common cause of the ICF (immunodeficiency, centrosome instability, and facial anomalies) syndrome in humans.
Train_Line_5430 C/EBPalpha-deficient mice have normal numbers of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) but lack granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) and all subsequent granulocytic stages (Fig 1B).
Train_Line_5431 JMML: juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia; NS-JMML: Noonan's syndrome JMML; RAEB-T: refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation; MDS: myelodysplasia; AML: acute myeloid leukemia; ALL: acute lymphoid leukemia; CMML: chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; CML: chronic myeloid leukemia; --: no case.
Train_Line_5432 Although only a few studies, including ours, have been published regarding LNK mutations in human MPN, the collective data does favor some suggestions.
Train_Line_5433 Among the 368 patients with MDS according to the WHO classification, 29 (7.9%) showed U2AF1 mutation.
Train_Line_5434 SF3B1 mutation, clonal dominance, and disease progression in hematologic malignancies.
Train_Line_5435 Abdel-Wahab et al raised the concern that a specific frameshift mutation (c.1934dupG;p.Gly646TrpfsX12) previously described by other groups might represent a PCR artifact rather than a true mutation.
Train_Line_5436 Mutations in the gene encoding splicing factor 3B, subunit 1 (SF3B1) co-occurred with mutations in all three genes.
Train_Line_5437 In other examples, TET2 mutations were only found in the leukemic cells.
Train_Line_5438 Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia and RAS Mutations Benefit Most From Postremission High-Dose Cytarabine: A Cancer and Leukemia Group B Study.

Train_Line_5440 MPL MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_5441 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_5442 All patients were diagnosed according to current criteria.
Train_Line_5443 To the best of our knowledge, this study recruited the largest number of WT1-mutated patients with abnormal cytogenetics to date.
Train_Line_5444 Disruption of the SETD2-H3K36me3 pathway is a distinct epigenetic mechanism for leukemia development.
Train_Line_5445 In addition, univariate analysis revealed that dose-intensified induction therapy was associated with an improved outcome in patients with AML who had MLL translocations (P = 0.01; P = 0.06 with adjustment for multiple testing) (Fig. S11C and S11D in the Supplementary Appendix) and in those who had NPM1 mutations (P = 0.01; P = 0.10 with adjustment for multiple testing) (Fig. S11E and S11F and Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_5446 The median onset of the AML was 46.5 days (Fig. 1c), suggesting additional cooperative events in the development of induced leukemia.
Train_Line_5447 This discovery, and the resultant question of how a single mutation might cause three distinct disease phenotypes led investigators to test the hypothesis that allele burden of the JAK2 mutation may contribute to this phenomenon.
Train_Line_5448 In univariate analysis, patients with frameshift mutations in ASXL1 had significantly shorter time to AML progression (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.74; P = .017), whereas a trend toward a reduced time to AML progression was observed when frameshift and point mutations combined were considered (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 0.95 to 3.58; P = .071; Table 4; Figs 1C and 1D; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_5449 DDX41 lesions caused altered pre-mRNA splicing and RNA processing.
Train_Line_5450 It associates with, regulates or is regulated by transcription factors implicated in myeloid malignancy (Supplementary Table 7).
Train_Line_5451 One mainstay of second-line treatment is cytarabine which can be used at intermediate (1 g/m2) and high-dose (2-3 g/m2) levels.
Train_Line_5452 Two of them (patients 107 and 108) acquired ASXL1 mutations when the disease progressed to AML and RAEB, respectively.
Train_Line_5453 SF3B1 mutations are most frequent (~80%) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with ring sideroblasts (RS) but lack prognostic relevance.
Train_Line_5454 Either mono- or bi-cytopenia: hemoglobin level <10 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count <1.8 3 109/L, or platelet count <100 x 109/L. However, higher blood counts do not exclude the diagnosis in the presence of unequivocal histological/cytogenetic evidence for myelodysplastic syndrome.
Train_Line_5455 Data was acquired on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with CellQuest software.
Train_Line_5456 The EBMT Registry reported on 65 t-AML patients who underwent autologous HSCT; the 3-year OS was 35%.
Train_Line_5457 Inclusion of the 4 low-level mutations identified after sequencing the first 96 patients at greater depth did not alter the survival outcome in that subgroup.
Train_Line_5458 S4 and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_5459 We identified somatic mutations in CALR in patients with primary myelofibrosis or essential thrombocythemia. CALR mutations are mutually exclusive with mutations in both JAK2 and MPL.
Train_Line_5460 Solary and coworkers have proposed a new prognostic score for CMML that includes not only age and hematologic parameters, but also ASXL1 mutations status.
Train_Line_5461 The MSCV-MPL-Neo and MSCV-MPL-IRES-EGFP retroviral vectors were generously provided by W. Tong and H. Lodish.
Train_Line_5462 Given the risk of teratogenicity, the option of therapeutic termination during the first trimester of pregnancy should be submitted for consideration by the mother.
Train_Line_5463 The number of patients in each leukemia group.
Train_Line_5464 Furthermore, disease complications in ET are effectively and safely managed by treatment with low-dose aspirin and, in case of high-risk disease, hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_5465 Colony numbers were counted after seven days.
Train_Line_5466 An interesting finding in our analysis is that mutations in SRSF2 were associated with mutations in RUNX1, a gene coding for a transcription factor, as well as IDH1, a gene coding for an enzyme of the citric acid cycle.
Train_Line_5467 Interestingly, each splice gene mutation was associated with one concomitant mutation in a gene involved in epigenetic regulation of transcription.
Train_Line_5468 Data for individual RMA readings is an average based on at least 2 independent experiments.
Train_Line_5469 The mutation rate in CMML was also similar between this study and others. (45.5% vs 43-49%).
Train_Line_5470 Karyotype risk designation and risk stratification were according to the Spanish cytogenetic risk stratification system and the MD Anderson prognostic scoring system (MDAPS), respectively.
Train_Line_5471 ZRSR2-mut patients had a similar clinical phenotype, clustered in IPSS intermediate-1 and intermediate-2 risk groups, had higher bone marrow blast percentages, and often exhibited isolated neutropenias.
Train_Line_5472 Mutation analysis of WT1 exons 7 and 9 was performed by genomic DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing as previously reported.
Train_Line_5473 Similarly, c-CBL knockout mice develop a mild MPN with an increase in HSC.
Train_Line_5474 Grade 3-4 according to the standard classification: diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally with only focal bundles of collagen and/or focal osteosclerosis or diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections with coarse bundles of collagen, often associated with significant osteosclerosis.
Train_Line_5475 In addition, the question of whether mutational profiling of a larger set of genes, including these novel disease alleles, improves prognostication in AML has not been investigated in a clinical trial cohort.
Train_Line_5476 The present review will summarize our current understanding of the role of C/EBPalpha in neoplasia.
Train_Line_5477 It remains possible that myeloablative conditioning might mitigate the impact of these adverse TP53 mutations (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_5478 Codon 76 was a mutational hot-spot for JMML, with four different amino-acid substitutions predicted among eight individuals.
Train_Line_5479 Downstream targets of this pathway were also activated, with constitutive phosphorylation of p42/44 ERK and AKT in 32D MPLW515L cells consistent with activation of the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways (Figure 1D).
Train_Line_5480 Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to the protocols and procedures approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) institutional review board (IRB3952 and IRB5024) and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_5481 Effect of TET2 mutations on survival.
Train_Line_5482 Intriguingly, SRSF2 mutation rarely occurred alone; all but 5 patients with SRSF2 mutation had at least 1 concurrent mutation of other genes, a finding compatible with the report of Nagata et al who found that there was frequent accompaniment of additional mutations in patients with SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_5483 Therefore, we examined genomic DNA of 221 MDS patients at diagnosis for the presence of SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and U2AF35 mutations by direct sequencing and evaluated their prognostic impact with regard to other mutations, including ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, ETV6, EZH2, IDH1/2, JAK2, NRAS, RUNX1, TET2, and TP53.
Train_Line_5484 The researchers tested the effect of the abnormal gene by putting it into cells grown in culture in the laboratory; they found that it made the cells grow more than was normal.
Train_Line_5485 WHOLE-EXOME SEQUENCING IN PRIMARY MYELOFIBROSIS.
Train_Line_5486 Our study benefited from the uniformity of data collected from a large cohort of patients from only 2 centers.
Train_Line_5487 Mutations and ASXL1 Expression Status The clinical and hematologic characteristics of patients with mutation versus without are listed in Table 1.
Train_Line_5488 MDS patients carrying TP53 mutation have an unfavorable clinical outcome and a high risk of leukemic evolution, and the same is true for patients with MPN.
Train_Line_5489 These pre-leukemic stem cells contain a first hit that significantly enhances the likelihood of subsequent leukemia development.
Train_Line_5490 In contrast, we identified no mutations affecting exons 4, 7 or 8 in isolated cases of JMML, and 95% of the mutations associated with JMML clustered in exon 3, with lesions altering Glu76 constituting 38% of defects.
Train_Line_5491 Table 4. Cooperative gene mutations in the 32 AML patients with WT1 mutations.
Train_Line_5492 In summary, the results of the present study suggest that the splicing machinery is one of the most frequently affected pathways in MDS.
Train_Line_5493 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_5494 Similar to the case of CML, resistance to imatinib arises in initially responsive GIST patients treated with the drug, and as with CML, this is almost always due to a secondary mutation in the same KIT allele as the original mutation.
Train_Line_5495 The DNA spanning the mutation spots of IDH detected at either diagnosis or during subsequent follow-ups was amplified and the PCR products were then cloned into the Taq polymerase-amplified (TA)-cloning vector pGEMVT Easy (Promega, Madison, WI).
Train_Line_5496 PATIENTS AND SAMPLES.
Train_Line_5497 Preclinial and clinical trials involving novel DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors are not mentioned. BET, bromodomain and extra-terminal; HDAC, histone deacetylase.
Train_Line_5498 The association of U2AF1 mutation with other gene mutations was also explored (Table II).
Train_Line_5499 DNMT3A mutations had no prognostic impact on OS, RFS, or CR rates in patients who had cytogenetic aberrations other than core-binding factor leukemias (15 mutations [10.1%] in 149 patients excluding CN-AML; OS, HR = 0.76, 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.52, P = .44; RFS, HR = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.07, P = .95, CR, odds ratio [OR] = 2.7, 95%CI, 0.73 to 10.02, P=.14; Data Supplement Figure S3).
Train_Line_5500 Multivariate analyses were conducted with the use of the Cox model with forward selection.
Train_Line_5501 Among patients with intermediate-risk AML as defined by cytogenetic analysis (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix), FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with reduced overall survival (P = 0.008), a finding that is consistent with the results of previous studies.
Train_Line_5502 To test the hypothesis that mutations in PTPN11 associated with JMML increased SHP-2's phosphatase activity, we expressed the two most common mutations, D61Y and E76K, in COS-7 cells.
Train_Line_5503 Clinical strategies to reinforce graft-versus-MDS effect or intensify conditioning or pretransplantation therapy or strategies that include post-HSCT therapy may be particularly beneficial in these patients.
Train_Line_5504 Outcome results similar to those after HiDAC consolidation may be obtained using other intense chemotherapy regimens.
Train_Line_5505 An inferior OS and a higher transformation rate to AML was also seen in patients defined by the genotype SRSF2-mut/TET2-wt in univariate analysis (OS: HR = 2.32; 95% CI, 1.05-5.11; P = .031; AML transformation: HR = 2.94; 95% CI, 1.13-7.61; P = .02; Figure 4C-D).
Train_Line_5506 In a smaller Chinese cohort of 82 MDS patients, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were found in two (2.4%) and three (3.6%) of cases, respectively.
Train_Line_5507 Indeed, the SOCS1 promoter contains binding sites for STAT1, STAT3 and STAT6.
Train_Line_5508 Transgenic JAK2V617F HSCs displayed only a slight advantage on JAK2 wild-type HSC in transplantation assays.
Train_Line_5509 To address these possibilities, we examined the association of mutations with the clinical parameters included in the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_5510 In searching for potential cooperative somatic genomic alterations in the twin with leukemia (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 3, 4, 6 and 7), we identified two nonsynonymous point mutations in SETD2 located in chromosome 3p (Supplementary Table 2), which encodes the only histone-modifying enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing H3K36me3 (ref. 10).
Train_Line_5511 In this subset, patients with RAS mutations in the HDAC group experienced relapse at a lower rate than those with RAS mutations in the LDAC group (P = .02), whereas the effect of consolidation dose on outcome did not reach significance among patients with wild-type RAS (P = .13).
Train_Line_5512 In a study based on massively parallel DNA sequencing, Ley et al found that DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML and are associated with a poor outcome.
Train_Line_5513 For patients with normal karyotype, the mutation was also an independent poor prognostic factor for OS.
Train_Line_5514 Somatic mutations of SF3B1 were found in approximately 30% of patients with MDS and in 20% of patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN).
Train_Line_5515 In the remaining 34 cases with follow-up samples, including six patients for whom we had a follow-up sample at the time of progression to AML, no IDH1 mutation was found.
Train_Line_5516 All other lesions were confirmed as somatic or germline by analysis of CD3-sorted cells (Tiu et al, 2009).
Train_Line_5517 Diagnosis.
Train_Line_5518 All 36 types of somatic insertions or deletions resulted in a frameshift to the alternative reading frame 1 (Fig. 2B).
Train_Line_5519 In our study, IDH2 mutation correlated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis, but was not an independent poor prognostic factors for OS, probably because its close association with older age, an independent poor prognostic factor.
Train_Line_5520 In addition, C/EBPalpha knockout mice display lung abnormalities such as a striking hyperproliferation of type II pneumocytes.
Train_Line_5521 According to previous investigations using transgenic mice, the mutational effect of LNK could be different according to the mutation type.
Train_Line_5522 The proof of this potential was demonstrated in one PV patient treated by pegylated IFN-alpha, where, after treatment, the JAK2V617F burden was at the threshold of detection, but the hematopoiesis was clonal because of a preexisting TET2 mutation.
Train_Line_5523 Another oncogenic protein, PLZF-RARA, has been shown to interfere with C/EBPalpha transactivating activity on the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter.
Train_Line_5524 In one study, global levels of DNA methylation did not differ between DNMT3A wild-type and mutant patients as assessed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Train_Line_5525 First-trimester spontaneous miscarriage rate in ET or PV (>30%) is significantly higher than the 15% rate expected in the control population and does not appear to be influenced by specific treatment.
Train_Line_5526 Notably, similar to the somatic CEBPA mutations, the somatic DDX41 mutations are hypomorphic, but the penetrance of CEBPA mutations is high, whereas it is currently unknown for DDX41.
Train_Line_5527 In cellular and animal models, ASXL1 mutations have been shown to promote myeloid transformation through loss of PRC2-mediated gene repression.
Train_Line_5528 Two recent studies suggest that there is heterogeneity among mutated CEBPA cases, in that only cases with double mutations, usually biallelic, have a favorable outcome.
Train_Line_5529 Clonal dominance: A condition in which most cells of a tissue belong to a clone.
Train_Line_5530 TP53 mutations were infrequent in patients with splicing mutations (5%, 3/59) compared to patients with wild type splicing factor genes (17%, 16/99, P < 0.04).
Train_Line_5531 Increasing age is associated with factors predictive of early death, for example, poor performance status or various comorbidities, and of treatment resistance, for example, adverse cytogenetics, secondary AML, or the MDR phenotype.
Train_Line_5532 These findings strongly support a causal relationship between SF3B1 mutations and ring sideroblasts, and more generally between abnormalities of mRNA splicing, abnormal gene expression profiles, and mitochondrial iron overload.
Train_Line_5533 In line with previous findings, matched TET2 mutations were found in both CD34+ and bone marrow cells at similar levels of abundance (median, 38.5% and 43% RMA, respectively).
Train_Line_5534 TET2 mutations are frequently found in patients with normal karyotype, and therefore represent a useful marker of clonality in these subjects.
Train_Line_5535 The study was designed to compare the sequences of the leukemic cells at diagnosis and of the paired normal hematopoietic cells at the time of complete remission from a patient with CN-AML without mutations of NPM1, CEBPA, or FLT3 (both internal tandem duplication and tyrosine kinase domain mutations) and negative for MLL-PTD.
Train_Line_5536 All patients signed informed consents for sample collection in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_5537 Randomized studies have compared daunorubicin at a dose of 45-60 mg/m2 with other anthracyclines, such as idarubicin or aclarubicin, with amsacrine, or with mitoxantrone.
Train_Line_5538 Recent studies have identified novel recurrent somatic mutations in patients with AML.
Train_Line_5539 The mechanism of how mutations in genes belonging to the splicing machinery can lead to the pathogenesis of MDS is still unknown.
Train_Line_5540 We also analyzed DNA from CD34+, CD3+ cells and constitutional DNA to determine mutant clone size and to ascertain the stage of acquisition of the TET2 aberration.
Train_Line_5541 Clonal architecture: Clonal composition of a neoplasm based on its clonal origin and subclonal evolution.
Train_Line_5542 TP53 mutations were detected in 12% (19/154) of patients who had a samples analysed for mutations in a broad spectrum of genes (Figure S4).
Train_Line_5543 Src family kinases (SFK), the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C-gamma and adaptors that lead to activation of MAP kinase pathways are directly recruited and activated by binding to phospho-Y residues on the receptor.
Train_Line_5544 The somatic nature of mutations in U2AF1 and SRSF2 was confirmed by sequencing nontumoral CD3+ cells in 4 patients (2 patients with U2AF1 Q157P mutations and 2 patients with SRSF2 P95R mutations; supplemental Figures 1 and 2).
Train_Line_5545 METHODS.
Train_Line_5546 Before examining this issue, we want to emphasize that, for a proper evaluation of the prognostic relevance of any somatic mutation in MDS patients, ad hoc analyses should account for left censoring of the observations at the time of mutation assessment and for right censoring of the observations at the time of any potentially disease-modifying treatment.
Train_Line_5547 Constitutional mutations of this gene are involved in Noonan's syndrome, a developmental disorder in which children have a predisposition to develop a myeloid disorder called juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_5548 The variables, including age, white blood cell (WBC), karyotype, and mutations of CEBPA, WT1, and NPM1/FLT3-ITD, were used as covariates.
Train_Line_5549 In SM, KIT mutation (usually D816V) has been observed in both indolent (ISM) and aggressive (ASM) forms of the disease.
Train_Line_5550 Further studies were organized in 2 phases (Figure 1).
Train_Line_5551 Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences were compared using the log-rank test.
Train_Line_5552 Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of first diagnosis to the date of last follow-up or death from any cause; patients who were alive at last follow-up were censored at the time of their last visit.
Train_Line_5553 Median observation time from diagnosis was 23 months (range, 1-267 months), whereas median time from diagnosis to mutation analysis was 4.5 months (range, 0-182 months).
Train_Line_5554 RARS-T is a myeloid neoplasm with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features at the molecular and clinical levels that may develop from RARS through the acquisition of somatic mutations of JAK2, MPL, or other as-yet-unknown genes.
Train_Line_5555 Dephosphorylation of C/EBPalpha Ser21 was also seen with a Flt3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and Flt3 kinase inhibitors are the subject of intense clinical study in AML.
Train_Line_5556 DNMTs are critical for establishing and maintaining CpG methylation.
Train_Line_5557 Ross L. Levine.
Train_Line_5558 In this study, we found that SRSF2 mutation were strongly associated with male sex and older age.
Train_Line_5559 These results are in accord with 2 recent reports investigating the prognostic importance of SF3B1 mutations in larger cohorts of MDS patients with RSs, which did not find an independent value within this subgroup of patients where the highest prevalence of SF3B1 mutations is found.
Train_Line_5560 The MDS-AML observed within these families is clinically heterogeneous and has a variety of somatic chromosomal abnormalities, including monosomy 7, trisomy 8 and trisomy 21 (Supplementary Table 2).
Train_Line_5561 Patient characteristics with high (n = 76) or low (n = 76) ASXL1 expression are listed in the Data Supplement.
Train_Line_5562 In a multivariate analysis including WHO categories, when stratifying MDS patients according to unilineage dysplasia, multilineage dysplasia, and excess of blasts, SF3B1 mutation remained an independent predictor of better clinical outcome (M.C., L.M., unpublished observations, October 2012).
Train_Line_5563 However, as mentioned earlier, the final analysis of a French PV study comparing hydroxyurea to pipobroman has revealed a shorter survival, an increased risk of leukemic transformation, and a lower risk of post-PV MF, associated with pipobroman therapy.
Train_Line_5564 Table 2. SF3B1 mutation type and SF3B1 mutant allele burden.
Train_Line_5565 Diagnostic assessment included cytochemistry with myeloperoxidase, nonspecific esterase, and iron staining.
Train_Line_5566 The results for cases with L576P mutation were surprising since in vitro studies indicated that this mutant has low sensitivity to imatinib.
Train_Line_5567 Detection of mutations in SRSF2 exon2 on BM cells was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_5568 Identification of such low-abundance mutant clones is important in understanding the relevance of TET2 protein function in disease and its contribution to clonal evolution.

Train_Line_5570 One of the downstream sequelae of this increased production of 2-HG is that enzymes that normally depend on a-KG as a substrate are functionally impaired in the presence of IDH1/2 mutations due to competitive inhibition by 2-HG.
Train_Line_5571 Case series have reported very low frequencies, both in adults and children.
Train_Line_5572 Sample collection.
Train_Line_5573 Patient groups with nominal variables were compared by X2-test.
Train_Line_5574 Molecular modeling of GATA2 ZF2 (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Note) showed that the Thr354 residue does not contact DNA but rather makes polar contact with adjacent threonines and, through its amino group, with Cys349, which coordinates the zinc atom.
Train_Line_5575 If large number of cases with LNK mutations would be collected in the future, the phenotypic difference according to mutation type could be evaluated.
Train_Line_5576 the combination of SRSF2 and TET2 mutation with CMML, and an activating CSF3R mutation with CNL.
Train_Line_5577 Certain disorders that combine myeloproliferation and myelodysplasia features, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, are closely related to MPDs.
Train_Line_5578 The two recent randomized trials examining the benefits of intensification of the dose of anthracycline in patients with AML showed that more intensive induction chemotherapy improved the outcomes.
Train_Line_5579 Moreover, the subset of patients with both NPM1 mutations and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had a particularly favorable outcome, superior to that of the cytogenetically favorable subset of AML patients (3-year OS of intermediate-risk AML patients with NPM1 and IDH1/IDH2 mutations was 89%).
Train_Line_5580 Multivariable analysis identified presence of mutant IDH1 (P = 0.0004; hazard ration 4.0, 95% confidence interval 1.9-8.8), revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk category (P<0.0001), and red cell transfusion need (P = 0.002) as independent predictors of inferior survival.
Train_Line_5581 Since the father did not develop disease until the age of 70, it is unclear whether all affected individuals will eventually develop MDS/AML.
Train_Line_5582 We next assessed the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in cytogenetic subgroups.
Train_Line_5583 In addition, both CD34-positive cells and immature RBCs from RARS patients are characterized by reduced expression of ABCB7, a gene that encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter involved in the regulation of mitochondrial iron homeostasis.
Train_Line_5584 The cells were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin for assessment of morphological changes.
Train_Line_5585 The mutations were confirmed by at least two repeated analyses.
Train_Line_5586 Limited data suggest that R882 mutations result in a loss of methyltransferase activity in in vitro assays.
Train_Line_5587 All mutations were confirmed in nonamplified genomic DNA or in an independent experiment in case cDNA was sequenced.
Train_Line_5588 We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients.
Train_Line_5589 Usually variants are missense mutations, which are homozygous because of an acquired uniparental disomy or, rarely, because of a deletion of the wild-type copy.
Train_Line_5590 This study was approved by the appropriate Regional Ethics Committees. Peripheral blood granulocytes and mononuclear cells were prepared by Ficoll gradient centrifugation.
Train_Line_5591 In a previous study, we identified somatic mutations of SF3B1, a gene encoding a core component of RNA splicing machinery, in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Train_Line_5592 Patient groups with nominal variables were compared by chi-square test.
Train_Line_5593 EZH2 is mutated in B-cell lymphomas, but the recurrent mutation targeting Y641 results in a gain of function: the mutated enzyme preferentially generates trimethylated K27.
Train_Line_5594 Patient characteristics in relation to SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutation status.
Train_Line_5595 The median overall survival (OS) of the entire cohort was 56 months (95%CI, 34-78 months) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 53 months (95% CI, 30-72 months).
Train_Line_5596 The panel proposes a standardized reporting system for genetic abnormalities when presenting data correlating genetic findings with clinical outcome allowing for a better comparison of data among studies (Table 4).
Train_Line_5597 In univariate analysis the overall survival of patients with IDH1 mutation was significantly shorter than that of patients with wild-type IDH1 (HR 3.20; 95% CI 1.47-6.99; Figure 2A).
Train_Line_5598 Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for multivariable analysis.
Train_Line_5599 Activating mutations in the RAS protooncogenes occur frequently in many types of human cancer, including myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_5600 Depending on the type of dominant clone, different hemopathies evolving in time and appearing in different sequences will be induced.
Train_Line_5601 Erythroblasts are not counted as blasts except in the rare instance of pure erythroid leukemia.
Train_Line_5602 Karyotype in FLT3-mutated CMML patient was diploid in 10 (77%), 20q- in 1 (8%), and others in 2 patients (15%).
Train_Line_5603 Patients.
Train_Line_5604 All the DNMT3A mutations in MDS are heterozygous and it is not known whether these nucleotide mutations result in a loss of function, gain of function, or have a dominant negative property.
Train_Line_5605 Adopted from reference 3; for a diagnosis of AML, a marrow blast count of >=20% is required, except for AML with the recurrent genetic abnormalities t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16) and some cases of erythroleukemia.
Train_Line_5606 The remaining 140 patients received low-dose chemotherapy and/or supportive care because of the poor performance status or the patients' will.
Train_Line_5607 Thirty-five AML patients showed other abnormal karyotypes, including
Train_Line_5608 About 90% of MDS patients carry >=1 oncogenic mutations, and two thirds of them are found in individuals with a normal karyotype.
Train_Line_5609 NSE stains show diffuse cytoplasmic activity in monoblasts (usually > 80% positive) and monocytes (usually > 20% positive).
Train_Line_5610 The difference of skipping ratio in ZMYM2 exon 3 can be used as an illustrative example (13% difference between DDX41 defect and WT; p = 0.019) (Figure 6C).

Train_Line_5615 Disease Overview.
Train_Line_5616 Interestingly, U2AF1 mutations were associated with mutations in ASXL1 (P = .005) and DNMT3A (P = .004), both of which are involved in epigenetic regulation.
Train_Line_5617 SF3B1 mutations were absent among mature B-cell neoplasms other than CLL, and in a separate study, a mutant SF3B1 was detected in only one of 63 subjects with clinical monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis, a condition that might represent the initial phases of CLL.
Train_Line_5618 ASXL1 frameshift mutations were associated with a reduced time to progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; HR 2.35; 95% CI, 1.17 to 4.74; P = .017).

Train_Line_5620 There is no indication for intrathecal prophylaxis in patients without CNS symptoms, although it may be considered in special situations (eg, hyperleukocytosis).
Train_Line_5621 There is preliminary evidence that the function of TET1 and TET2 is mainly related to the generation of 5hmc.
Train_Line_5622 Figure 5. Protein Interactions of DDX41 and Splicing Factors. (A) DDX41 interactions with spliceosomal protein complexes are indicated. Spliceosomal proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with DDX41 were organized in colored functional protein complexes based on Ingenuity pathway analysis and published data (Hegele et al., 2012). Individual protein enrichment was presented as total spectral counts and displayed by different circle size. Increased circle size indicates higher number of total spectra counts for the protein. Total spectral count is a semiquantitative method to predict abundance of a specific protein and is not used to compare with abundance of other proteins. Unfilled double-ring symbols indicate proteins that were not identified in DDX41 co-immunoprecipitation experiments but that have been linked to the spliceosome. (B) Summary of cataloging and quantification of protein interactions with WT and mutant DDX41. Protein names and their associated spliceosomal complex are shown on top of bars. Protein abundance was normalized to DDX41 and presented as ratio of mutant to WT in log2 scale. Light purple shading indicates no significant difference in protein interaction between WT and mutant DDX41 (log2 scale between 0.5 and ~0.5). += SD was calculated based on the three strongest peak intensities used in the calculation. See also Figure S6 and Table S5.
Train_Line_5623 A similar retrospective study in 164 patients with ET treated with pipobroman as first-line therapy (starting dose 1 mg/kg/day) and followed for a median of 100 months, AML occurred in 5.5% of the cases.
Train_Line_5624 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_5625 CK-AMLs belong to the cytogenetic adverse-risk group because they are associated with very poor outcome when treated with intensive or nonintensive conventional chemotherapy.
Train_Line_5626 The low incidence of ZRSR2 mutations precluded a formal survival analysis.
Train_Line_5627 ASXL2 has been shown to regulate heart and bone development, as well as adipogenesis.
Train_Line_5628 Further analyses on larger patient cohorts are needed to confirm these findings.
Train_Line_5629 Partial responses or disease stabilisation were achieved in around 80% of patients with 2 year survival of 75-80%.
Train_Line_5630 Cells were plated at 1.5 x 104 cells per dish for bone marrow cells and 5 x 104 cells per dish for spleen cells, in duplicate.
Train_Line_5631 Some of these patients respond to epigenetic therapy, including hypomethylating drugs (azacitidine and decitabine) and drugs that inhibit multiple histone deacetylases.
Train_Line_5632 Considering mutations in all genes investigated in our study, at least 1 mutation was detected in 100 (51.8%) patients, of which 20 (10.4%) had 2 mutated genes and 11 (5.7%) had 3 mutated genes.
Train_Line_5633 Significance was determined at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, except for P values in multiple comparisons, for which Bonferroni correction was applied.
Train_Line_5634 We next examined whether mutations predict prognosis after adjusting for the LR-PSS.
Train_Line_5635 In contrast, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations leading to an internal tandem duplication (ITD) are associated with adverse outcome.
Train_Line_5636 Details of the treatment protocols have been reported previously.
Train_Line_5637 In multivariable analysis, TP53 alteration is the most important prognostic factor in CK-AML, outweighing all other variables, including the MK category.
Train_Line_5638 The median time from first to subsequent sample was 4 months (range 1-17 months) in 5-azacitidine group and 17 months (6-39 months) in the lenalidomide group.
Train_Line_5639 We analyzed 355 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes using "next-generation" sequencing for TET2 aberrations, 91 of whom were also subjected to single-nucleotide polymorphism 6.0 array karyotyping.
Train_Line_5640 ‫
Train_Line_5641 Among 8 studies, 7 demonstrated that immunophenotypic detection of MRD in AML after induction and consolidation provides independent prognostic information.
Train_Line_5642 One patient (UPN 379929) had two mutations in different exons.
Train_Line_5643 The distribution of the JAK2, MPL, and CALR mutations in the three disease entities is shown in Figure 1A.
Train_Line_5644 Follow-up information was available for 198 of the 221 MDS patients.
Train_Line_5645 A stringent algorithm was applied for the identification of lesions using SNP arrays.
Train_Line_5646 Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_5647 After 8 months of follow-up the allelic ratio of mutated JAK2 increased to 43%T and the platelet count rose to 637x109/L, i.e. progressing by definition to RARS-T, and at 16 months to 98%T with a platelet count of 787x109/L (Table 1 and Figure 3A, D and G).
Train_Line_5648 Sequencing versus SNP array data.
Train_Line_5649 However, subsequent studies suggest that the converse may happen and also that TET2 mutations may occur when MPNs transform to AML.
Train_Line_5650 First, we examined the hazard ratio (HR) of death associated with mutations in the 17 genes mutated in >= 5% of patients in this cohort (Table 2; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_5651 First being identified as recurrent mutations in glioblastoma multiforme and low grade gliomas, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were found subsequently in AML, MDS, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
Train_Line_5652 The functional consequences of the remaining mutations has not been studied, therefore we applied a computational algorithm to assess the consequences of the remaining missense mutations.
Train_Line_5653 Mutation analyses of IDH1R132, IDH2R140, and IDH2R172 were performed on BM cells by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing as previously reported.
Train_Line_5654 Some steps of this model are still working hypotheses, which will hopefully be verified in the near future.
Train_Line_5655 TARGETING C/EBPalpha TO FIGHT CANCER.
Train_Line_5656 PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS.
Train_Line_5657 Defects in exons 4, 7 and 8 accounted for one half and the N308D substitution accounted for one third of cases of Noonan syndrome without JMML associated with mutations in PTPN11.
Train_Line_5658 One study has described this mutation as a PCR artefact, but because it is not found in germ-line DNAs, control DNAs or other studied types of cancers such as breast cancer, it is now generally considered to be a bona fide mutation.
Train_Line_5659 In contrast, JAK2V617F HSCs predominate in advanced MPNs such as PMF or secondary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_5660 Clinical and hematologic data were recorded after patients with MDS gave informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the scientific analysis of the samples was approved by the institutional review board of Hannover Medical School (ethical vote No.2467).
Train_Line_5661 In this study, we delineated WT1 mutation in 470 de novo non-M3 AML patients, both cytogenetically normal and abnormal, and investigated its association with other gene alterations.
Train_Line_5662 In addition, adverse dropout rate was significantly higher in the anagrelide arm.

Train_Line_5667 Statistical Analysis.
Train_Line_5668 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_5669 WHAT DO THESE FINDINGS MEAN?
Train_Line_5670 No difference was found in clinical and hematologic variables between mutated and unmutated RARS-T patients.
Train_Line_5671 The SSRP1 gene, corresponding to FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), was selected because it is involved in transcriptional mechanisms through chromatin remodeling.
Train_Line_5672 These mutations span the linker region between the SH2 and JH2 domains.
Train_Line_5673 Mutations in several other receptor tyrosine kinase proteins were discovered in the thrombopoietin receptor, MPL, and Casitas B-lineage lymphoma protooncogene, CBL.
Train_Line_5674 Using NGS sequencing to complement SNP6 arrays, we identified 8 additional cases with SNPs and mutations at > 65% RMA, indicative of LOH.
Train_Line_5675 F, R and T indicate the number of variant reads observed in the forward strand (F) or in the reverse strand (R) and the number of total reads (T) covering that position; R/V, reference/variant nucleotide; P, p-value associated to the probability that the variant is detected due to a sequencing error in the tumor (T err), a sequencing error in the normal (N err), and a germline variant (Germ.).
Train_Line_5676 RESULTS.
Train_Line_5677 First complete remission samples were additionally used as surrogate for germline DNA.
Train_Line_5678 Thus, mutations in TP53, TET2, and DNMT3A are predictors of survival, and 60% of patients with MDS without these mutations were alive and disease free 3 years after HSCT.
Train_Line_5679 These components assemble to play a role in DSBs repair.
Train_Line_5680 ASXL1 is mutated in all types of malignant myeloid diseases, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_5681 When we expanded our study to the larger cohort for targeted deep sequencing (n=1295), 26 BRCC3 mutations were identified (2.0%), 11 with refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 9 with RCMD, 1 with refractory anemia, 1 with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts, 1 with isolated 5q syndrome, 1 with CMML, 1 with RARS associated with thrombocytosis (RARS-T), and 1 with primary AML (Table 1).
Train_Line_5682 Leukemic transformation, or blast phase, occurs in approximately 15% of PMF patients and in < 10% of PV and ET patients (Table 1).
Train_Line_5683 When cloning the equivalent amplicons of other patients, we did not observe this specific mutation.
Train_Line_5684 The nature of these mutations (which prevent imatinib binding either directly or by influencing the conformation of the binding site) and second-generation inhibitors designed to overcome this resistance are discussed in the previous section.
Train_Line_5685 Variables considered for model inclusion were karyotype (favorable v intermediate v high risk), transfusion dependence, ferritin level (greater v less than 1,000 mug/L), age (greater v less than median), IDH1 mutation status, number of therapies (best supportive care v at least one other treatment), and ASXL1 mutation status.
Train_Line_5686 Additional samples from patients with MF were collected on a separate Dana-Farber Cancer Institute protocol.
Train_Line_5687 This is consistent with the mutation status of this patient with 2 mutations, one at 69% and one at 22% RMA (shown in Figure 5B-C as a representative experiment and in Table 2 as an average of 3 such experiments [71% and 20%]), suggesting the existence of 2 disease clones and the occurrence of a second mutation event after recombination.
Train_Line_5688 Ten percent of patients displayed primary resistance (defined as progression within the first 6 months of treatment) the frequency of which was related to KIT mutational status (WT>exon 9>exon 11).
Train_Line_5689 Our results clearly show that patients with a CALR mutation have a lower risk of thrombosis and have longer overall survival than those with a JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_5690 The prognostic significance of TET2 aberrations in MDS remains unclear, with conflicting reports on the effect of mutant TET2 on overall survival.
Train_Line_5691 Of 88 patients with MDS/MPN, 67 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 18 had RARS associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T), and 3 had MDS/MPN unclassifiable (MDS/MPN, U).
Train_Line_5692 cDNA or DNA clone sequencing confirmed that each of the two mutations occurs on separate alleles of SETD2 in individual patients, indicating a biallelic nature (Supplementary Table 3).
Train_Line_5693 Fifteen patients also had additional samples taken at a median of 15 months (range 6-27 months) post-initiation of 5-azacitidine therapy.
Train_Line_5694 Mutations affecting codons 175, 248, and 273 were associated with biallelic TP53 alteration compared with all other TP53 mutations (100% [27 of 27] vs 79% [90 of 114], P = .008).

(D) Wild-type WT1 at diagnosis (top) and nt1335/1336 (+11 bp) on exon 7 at relapse (bottom).
Train_Line_5696 A striking increase in megakaryocyte numbers correlated with high platelet counts up to a maximum of 1544x109/L.
Train_Line_5697 The fact that a small proportion of patients with WHO categories not specifically associated with ring sideroblasts carried an SF3B1 mutation was expected.
Train_Line_5698 Preparation of mononuclear cells, genomic DNA, RNA, and cDNA was performed as previously reported.
Train_Line_5699 These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML.
Train_Line_5700 The first category included patients with trisomy 8 or TET2, DNMT3A, or MLL-PTD mutations, which were associated with an adverse outcome (3-year rate of overall survival, 14.5%); this rate of survival was significantly lower than the rates among patients in the second category, those with wildtype CEBPA, TET2, DNMT3A, and MLL-PTD (overall survival, 35.2%; P<0.001), and patients in the third category, those with CEBPA mutations (overall survival, 42%; P<0.001) (Fig. 2B).
Train_Line_5701 The likelihood ratio test performed on the inclusion of SF3B1 mutation status into the model based on WPSS was nonetheless significant (P = .018), indicating that such inclusion added to the model's predictive power.
Train_Line_5702 All patient samples had >= 70% leukemic cells.
Train_Line_5703 Mutations in ASXL1 are associated with poor prognosis across the spectrum of malignant myeloid diseases.
Train_Line_5704 A score of three or more was considered positive.
Train_Line_5705 They identified 9 genes that were recurrently mutated: 4 (TP53, ATM, MYD88, and NOTCH1) were already known for their established role in CLL, whereas the remaining 5 genes (SF3B1, FBXW7, ZMYM3, DDX3X, and MAPK1) had not been previously associated with CLL.
Train_Line_5706 Treatment with imatinib has generally failed to deliver benefit, likely reflecting its lack of activity on D816 mutant KIT.
Train_Line_5707 Table 1. Patient Demographic and Clinical Characteristics (N = 87).
Train_Line_5708 Most importantly, ASXL1 mutations have been associated with adverse outcome in all studies to date in AML, MDS, and myeloproliferative neoplasm.
Train_Line_5709 Whereas IDH1 and DNMT3A mutations mainly cluster with NPM1-mutated AML, the subgroup of CN-AML patients that are devoid of NPM1 and CEBPA mutations remain molecularly poorly characterized.
Train_Line_5710 After retroviral production and transfection of the CALR cDNAs into the interleukin-3-dependent murine cell line Ba/F3, we sorted the transgene-positive cells by means of flow cytometry for GFP (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_5711 The identification of promoter hypermethylation affecting components of signaling pathways raises the possibility of the use of demethylating agents as potential therapy in patients with myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_5712 Next generation sequencing technologies have provided insights into the molecular heterogeneity of various myeloid neoplasms, revealing previously unknown somatic genetic events.
Train_Line_5713 Of the 51 sequentially analysed patients, 44 were treated with 5-azacitidine and 7 with lenalidomide.
Train_Line_5714 Conclusion.
Train_Line_5715 All mutations, except one, target a hot spot located between codons 208 and 234.
Train_Line_5716 The SF3B1 gene encodes subunit 1 of the splicing factor 3b, which is important for anchoring the spliceosome to precursor mRNA.
Train_Line_5717 Therefore, it seems likely that similar downstream pathways may be activated by different mediators of signal transduction in the JAK2V617F negative subtypes of RARS-T.
Train_Line_5718 WT1 mutations were identified in 6.8% of total patients and 8.3% of younger patients with normal karyotype (CN-AML).
Train_Line_5719 However, these currently clinically used technologies will be inadequate for comprehensive genetic characterization of AML patients in the future; conventional Sanger sequencing will be overly costly and unwieldy for these purposes as well.
Train_Line_5720 It is likely that mutations in other genes have yet to be discovered.
Train_Line_5721 Lentivirally infected human CD34+ cells were added to methylcellulose medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml human IL-3, 50 ng/ml SCF, 3 U/ml erythropoietin, 10 ng/ml GM-CSF, and 20% FBS.
Train_Line_5722 Two out of 36 U2AF1-mutated patients had concurrent SF3B1 mutation compared to 48 of 442 U2AF1-wild patients did so, but the difference was not statistically significant.
Train_Line_5723 Thus, the pathogenesis of the MPN has evolved from a simple to a complex model.
Train_Line_5724 Currently, the underlying mechanism of altered DNA methylation in cancer genomes and the critical target genes affected by methylation remain largely unknown.
Train_Line_5725 In patients with RARS, the iron deposited in perinuclear mitochondria of ring sideroblasts is present in the form of mitochondrial ferritin, which is encoded by the FTMT gene and is undetectable in normal erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_5726 Suppression of C/EBPalpha Transcription.
Train_Line_5727 Primers used included: (for 1st PCR) Forward: 5'-CAAGGTGGACAACCTGACCT-3'; Reverse: 5'-AGACGCCATTTCCCCAGT-3'; (for 2nd PCR) Forward: 5'-GTGGACAACCTGACCTACCG-3'; and Reverse: 5'-CCTCAGCCCCGTTTACCT3'.
Train_Line_5728 It is likely that the leukaemic progression is secondary to acquisition of other mutations known to be associated with leukaemic progression in MDS, such as FLT3, NRAS.
Train_Line_5729 Our data confirm prior studies that indicate that mutations in ASXL1 are among the most common mutations found in MDS, with a frequency of 20.7%; heterozygous frameshift mutations (70%) are more common than heterozygous missense mutations(30%).
Train_Line_5730 Mutated Genes Associated With Prognostic Features.
Train_Line_5731 This is reminiscent of PU.1 overexpression found in murine erythroleukemias (Friend's erythroleukemia).
Train_Line_5732 These observations were confirmed by experiments in hematopoietic cells using shRNA directed against ASXL1, which were highly coherent with the expected role of ASXL1 in leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_5733 Furthermore, several cytogenetic abnormalities are considered sufficient to establish the WHO diagnosis of "AML with myelodysplasia-related features" when 20% or more blood or marrow blasts are present (Table 1).
Train_Line_5734 In addition, CD34+ cells from PV or ET patients at diagnosis generate essentially JAK2 wild-type hematopoiesis in xenograft experiments, showing that JAK2V617F HSC are still in minority in early disease.
Train_Line_5735 In the earlier study, 809 high-risk patients were given low-dose aspirin plus either anagrelide or hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_5736 From the above and other evidence, it follows that development of overt malignancy requires additional "hits" as well as mutant KIT and targeting these together with KIT is likely to be a successful therapeutic approach.
Train_Line_5737 Somatic mutations of DDX41 occur but are rare in non-hematologic malignancies (http://www.sanger.ac.uk).
Train_Line_5738 MDS patients with mutations of TP53 had a paucity of mutations in other genes; only 8 patients with mutant TP53 had other coexisting mutations, including U2AF1 (n = 3), IDH2 (n = 2), RUNX1 (n = 2), TET2 (n = 2), ASXL1 (n = 1) and DNMT3A (n = 1).
Train_Line_5739 Point mutations were confirmed in an independent experiment.
Train_Line_5740 Our findings highlight the power of approaches investigating familial predispositions to cancer and have implications for diagnostic genetic testing.
Train_Line_5741 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_5742 MUTATION ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_5743 The expression level of SOCS1 was similar to that observed in normal granulocytes and was dramatically lower than that in untransformed MPD cases (Figure 3A and data not shown).
Train_Line_5744 Because the AML index patient used for WES carried a normal karyotype, we mainly focused our search for BCOR mutations in patients with a similar genomic profile.
Train_Line_5745 Differences were observed in multivariable Cox models created by examining the entire cohort of patients and those in the day-100 landmark group (Table 3).
Train_Line_5746 The antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid can be useful in reducing bleeding and platelet transfusion.
Train_Line_5747 Patient 33 acquired WT1 mutation at second relapse, 66 months after the initial study at diagnosis and 5 months after second human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling allogeneic HSCT.
Train_Line_5748 The prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML has been extensively studied, but their clinical implications in MDS remain unclear.
Train_Line_5749 * Some oncogenic KIT mutations prevent binding of imatinib and other SMIs; mutation analysis of KIT in individual patients is needed to determine the optimal drug and dose.
Train_Line_5750 Sample Collection.
Train_Line_5751 Identification of BRCC3 mutations in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_5752 Allelic burden estimates were derived for all variants with minimum sequence coverage of 25 reads and mutant allele representation of at least 10% of the total reads.
Train_Line_5753 Patients with IDH1 mutations presented with a lower white blood cell count (median 2.2, range 1-4.7) and were all transfusion-dependent at diagnosis.
Train_Line_5754 Colony formation was assessed after 10 d.
Train_Line_5755 In AML, IDH2 mutations were associated with DNMT3A mutations, but not with ASXL1 mutations.
Train_Line_5756 The approval of this agent was based upon two phase III clinical trials (COMFORT I and II) which showed ruxolitinib was effective in reducing spleen size and reduction in symptoms.
Train_Line_5757 Alteration of substrate specificity by the corresponding mutation in murine Kit, D814V, was also reported.
Train_Line_5758 RESULTS.
Train_Line_5759 RA, refractory anemia; RAEB-1, refractory anemia with excess blasts-1; RAEB-2, refractory anemia with excess blasts-2; RARS, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblats; RARS-T, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblats and thrombocytosis; RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; RCMD-RS, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts; MDS-U, myelodysplastic syndrome unclassified.
Train_Line_5760 By analyzing follow-up samples we addressed the issue of whether the ratio of the mutated JAK2 mutant allele may increase with time and disease progression.
Train_Line_5761 CML and the other BCR-ABL1 negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are often characterized by mutations that lead to a growth advantage through constitutive activation of signaling pathways inherent to normal hematopoietic growth and development.
Train_Line_5762 The incidences of WT1 mutation were not significantly different between patients with normal karyotype (16 of 230, 7.0%) and those with abnormal cytogenetics (14 of 222, 6.3%; P = .851), and among patients with favorable (5.1%), intermediate (7.0%), and unfavorable karyotypes (6.1%).
Train_Line_5763 Similarly, in WHO-defined PV, the 10-year projected rates for survival, leukemic transformation, and fibrotic progression were >75, <5, and <10%, respectively.
Train_Line_5764 Statistics.
Train_Line_5765 Treatment with aspirin did not increase the incidence of major bleeding and instead reduced the risk of combined endpoints for "nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes" and "nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from cardiovascular causes".
Train_Line_5766 The relationships between BCOR and other genetic mutations in the German selected series of 160 CN-AML patients for whom an extensive molecular genetic characterization was available are shown in Figure 4.
Train_Line_5767 Nevertheless, there is a need for more reliable diagnostic and prognostic tools.
Train_Line_5768 This finding plus other data suggest the existence of a modifier gene in the human disease.
Train_Line_5769 When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation confirms the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis.
Train_Line_5770 The MEK1/2 inhibitor CI-1040 inhibits hnRNP-E2 expression, and through its association with C/EBPalpha mRNA, results in increased C/EBPalpha protein expression and granulocytic differentiation of BCRABL- expressing 32D cells.
Train_Line_5771 This is due, in part, to the lack of well-validated inhibitors of forms of KIT with certain activation loop mutations.
Train_Line_5772 RSs were not observed in any of the 25 ZRSR2-mut patients (P = .011).
Train_Line_5773 The frequency of the 46/1 JAK2V617F mutation predisposition genotype was analyzed in 344 of 355 patients and identified in 148 (43%) patients with an allelic frequency of 24% (130 heterozygous, 18 homozygous).
Train_Line_5774 U2AF1 mutation was also an independent poor-risk factor for OS in younger patients (P = 0.041), after adjustment for IPSS, using a multivariate Cox-regression analysis.
Train_Line_5775 Survival was longer in the posaconazole group, although it is unclear how much of the difference was due to the superiority of posaconazole to itraconazole rather than the superiority of posaconazole to fluconazole.

Train_Line_5777 With a median follow-up period of 43.3 months, the patients with U2AF1 mutation had a similar overall survival (OS) to those without this mutation (P = 0.373, Fig. 2A).
Train_Line_5778 Although its sensitivity, as reported in previous studies, is at least 1 log below that of RQ-PCR assays, the sensitivity will likely be improved by the use of 6- to 8-color laser technology.
Train_Line_5779 Somatic mutations of CBL, TET2, ASXL1, and IDH/IDH2 have been detected in the advanced phase of chronic myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_5780 Among the 34 patients with SRSF2 mutation, 29 had at least 1 additional mutation concurrently: 19 had 1, 5 each had 2 and 3, respectively.
Train_Line_5781 This finding supports the clinical results that have shown good clinical responses in constitutional symptoms like asthenia and splenomegaly in myelofibrosis but a weak effect on the JAK2V617F clone.
Train_Line_5782 Somatic mutations were also found in other RNA helicase genes, suggesting that they constitute a family of tumor suppressor genes in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_5783 Familial in mastocytosis.
Train_Line_5784 This approach seems potentially feasible since virtually all AML blasts express CD33, and a calicheamicin-bound antiCD33 antibody, gemtuzumab is already in clinical use.
Train_Line_5785 We aimed to analyze clinical impacts of the U2AF1 mutation on patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its stability during disease progression.
Train_Line_5786 Recently, we showed that germline mutations in PTPN11, which encodes the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, cause Noonan syndrome, a developmental disorder with short stature, facial dysmorphia, skeletal anomalies and heart defects.
Train_Line_5787 These outcomes include reduced (or also increased) transcription, exon skipping, intron retention, and cryptic splice site activation with truncated (or elongated) exon (Figure 2).
Train_Line_5788 Similarly, mutant TP53 prevents the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex from phosphorylating ATM, leading to impaired HR.
Train_Line_5789 The exact mechanism of how the C/EBPalpha mutants inhibit granulocytic differentiation is not entirely clear at present.
Train_Line_5790 While this manuscript was under consideration, germline GATA2 mutations were reported (including those resulting in p.Thr354Met and other ZF2 and ZF1 alterations) in monocytopenia and mycobacterial infection (MonoMAC) syndrome or dendritic cell, monocyte, B and natural killer lymphoid (DCML) deficiency, autosomal dominant or sporadic syndromes associated with cytopenias, susceptibility to infections and MDS-AML.
Train_Line_5791 Colony assays.
Train_Line_5792 The JAK2V617F mutation is present in most patients with polycythemia vera (PV), in about 50% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF), but only at a low frequency in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Train_Line_5793 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) constitute one of five categories of myeloid malignancies, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for hematopoietic tumors (Table I).
Train_Line_5794 Mutations in TET2 and IDH 1/2 have been found to be mutually exclusive and share unique patterns of DNA methylation as well as gene expression, suggesting their shared mechanism in disease biology.
Train_Line_5795 Moreover, in the majority of these female patients, the high proportion of mutated reads, relative to the percentage of leukemic cells in the analyzed samples, pointed to the exclusive expression of the mutated allele (Table 2) arguing against escape of this gene from X-chromosome inactivation; a phenomenon known to involve approximately 20% of human X-chromosome genes and leading to their biallelic expression.
Train_Line_5796 Surprisingly, there was no difference in the mean SOCS3 transcript level in either granulocytes or mononuclear cells between IMF patients carrying a methylated SOCS3 promoter and those with an unmethylated SOCS3 promoter.
Train_Line_5797 In this scheme, Noonan syndrome/JMML mutants are predicted to have intermediate effects, potentially explaining the milder course of the JMML when it occurs in the context of Noonan syndrome.
Train_Line_5798 Methylation status was also determined for DNA from 34 normal individuals; in 19 cases the DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, in 8 cases from purified granulocytes, and in 7 cases from bone marrow.
Train_Line_5799 An accurate quantitative enumeration of ring sideroblasts using consensus criteria was performed in 325 MDS patients.
Train_Line_5800 Median (range).
Train_Line_5801 Although, TET2 mutations have been shown to be an early-disease event and pre-JAK2 lesion in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), recent data from colony assays, in some MPN patients, show that TET2 and JAK2 mutations can occur independently of each other.
Train_Line_5802 Abbreviation: HR, hazard ratio.
Train_Line_5803 Until now, RARS-T BP was observed only in JAK2V617F negative patients.
Train_Line_5804 Table 1. Methylation status of SOCS1 and SOCS3 CpG islands in myeloproliferative disorders patients.
Train_Line_5805 The colonies were picked up, and cells were pooled and replated (104 cells/plate) onto secondary methylcellulose plates.
Train_Line_5806 The analysis involved 148,318 exons and comparison of their average usages between DDX41 defects (n = 5) and controls (n = 11) (Figure 6A; Figure S7A).
Train_Line_5807 Recent studies have identified additional novel mutations in patients with myeloproliferative and other myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_5808 METHODS.
Train_Line_5809 Felicitas Thol; Eva M. Weissinger; Jurgen Krauter; Katharina Wagner; Frederik Damm; Martin Wichmann; Gudrun Gohring; Christiane Schumann; Gesine Bug; Oliver Ottmann; Wolf-Karsten Hofmann; Brigitte Schlegelberger; Arnold Ganser; Michael Heuser.
Train_Line_5810 Spliceosome as a target for therapy.
Train_Line_5811 We also identified mutational combinations that occur commonly in patients with AML and those that rarely, if ever, co-occur; these findings are consistent with the existence of additional mutational complementation groups with gene mutations that are mutually exclusive with one another in large patient cohorts.
Train_Line_5812 Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed 5q- and 7q-.
Train_Line_5813 The most common myeloproliferative neoplasms are chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_5814 Clearly, the positive prognostic value of SF3B1 mutation may be partly or completely lost after acquisition of other somatic mutations, in particular those associated with disease progression.
Train_Line_5815 Somatic mutations of RUNX1 are found in ~7% to 8% of all patients with MDS and are generally associated with advanced disease, severe thrombocytopenia, and poor clinical outcome.
Train_Line_5816 Briefly, tumor DNAs were extracted from patients' bone marrow cells.
Train_Line_5817 In addition, sequential analysis of SRSF2 mutation during the clinical follow-ups was performed to evaluate the stability of this mutation in disease progression.
Train_Line_5818 Many studies have reported on the use of pipobroman as a single agent in PV.
Train_Line_5819 For all MPLW515L-positive MF patients for which bone marrow histopathology was available (3/4), marked megakaryocyte hyperplasia was noted.
Train_Line_5820 As stated above, this mutant form of KIT is highly resistant to the drug and most cases have proved refractory.
Train_Line_5821 Taken together, these genetic data suggest that CALR mutations represent a novel driver event that occurs early in pathogenesis and has a functional role similar to that of JAK2 or MPL mutations during the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_5822 In addition, we found that TET2 mutations were associated with reduced overall survival among patients with intermediate-risk AML (P = 0.007) (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_5823 A total of 477 adult patients diagnosed as having de novo MDS according to French-American-British (FAB) Cooperative Group Criteria who had cryopreserved BM cells and complete clinical and laboratory data for analysis were enrolled.
Train_Line_5824 In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the presence of subclonal driver mutations adversely impacts clinical outcome.
Train_Line_5825 A similar percentage (3%) developed the complication in another study involving ET patients.
Train_Line_5826 Scarce data are available regarding whether t-AML changes outcome in general, or only in specific subsets.
Train_Line_5827 Table 5. Response criteria in AML.
Train_Line_5828 On analyzing the groups separately, we noted a trend toward decreased OS in FLT3-mutated CMML patients when compared with CMML patients without FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_5829 Thus, novel genetic aberrations in MDS need to be evaluated regarding their prognostic impact.
Train_Line_5830 Six patients with mutant DNMT3A had low or INT-1 IPSS scores, and 6 patients had INT-2 or high scores, indicating that mutations occurred in patients that were low and high risk for AML progression based on their IPSS.
Train_Line_5831 In addition to mutations in genes that affect DNA cytosine modifications, genes which affect histone posttranslational modifications have also been found to be repeatedly mutated in AML.
Train_Line_5832 To date, 225 (81%) deaths and 49 (18%) LTs have occurred.
Train_Line_5833 Twenty-three (82.1%) were hemizygous due to either male sex or a deletion of chromosome X (-X) (BRCC3 is located on chromosome X).
Train_Line_5834 To improve on these results, alternative conditioning regimens are being investigated.
Train_Line_5835 The degree of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have additional prognostic significance, as shown by the recent study on the revised IPSS (IPSS-R) for MDS.
Train_Line_5836 In fact, Sf3b1 heterozygous knockout mice have skeletal abnormalities associated with ectopic Hox gene expression.
Train_Line_5837 Alterations in ZF2 are likely to initiate an exclusively myeloid pathway of oncogenesis in which subsequent gene-specific somatically acquired mutations probably define the particular type of disease that ultimately arises.
Train_Line_5838 Since its characterization approximately 15 years ago (Huang et al 1995; Takaki et al 1997; Li et al 2000), the adaptor protein SH2B3 has been identified as an important negative regulator of cytokine signaling in haematopoietic cells, and mutations in SH2B3 were recently found in MPN patients (Oh et al 2010a,b; Pardanani et al 2010; Ha & Jeon, 2011; Hurtado et al 2011; Lasho et al 2011).
Train_Line_5839 Shang-Ju Wu; Yuan-Yeh Kuo; Hsin-An Hou; Li-Yu Li; Mei-Hsuan Tseng; Chi-Fei Huang; Fen-Yu Lee; Ming-Chih Liu; Chia-Wen Liu; Chien-Ting Lin; Chien-Yuan Chen; Wen-Chien Chou; Ming Yao; Shang-Yi Huang; Bor-Sheng Ko; Jih-Luh Tang; Woei Tsay; Hwei-Fang Tien.
Train_Line_5840 Two mutations in the same allele, leading to amino acid substitutions V560G and D816V in the juxtamembrane auto-regulatory domain and the kinase domain, respectively, were reported.
Train_Line_5841 More than 50% of patients with myelodysplasia carry somatic mutations in spliceosome genes encoding proteins involved in the 39 splice site recognition and U2 snRNP function.
Train_Line_5842 Screening for these 2 markers as well as for FLT3 mutations should be done in clinical trials.
Train_Line_5843 The prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations was evaluated in the context of other clinical prognostic markers and genetic risk factors (cytogenetic risk group; mutations in NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2, MLL1, NRAS, WT1, and WT1 SNPrs16754; expression levels of BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MLL5, MN1, and WT1).
Train_Line_5844 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.
Train_Line_5845 Spliceosome mutations: their unexpected promotion of clonal proliferation and the concept of genetic predestination.
Train_Line_5846 Such alloimmunized patients are transfused with either HLA-matched platelets or crossmatch-compatible platelets.
Train_Line_5847 According to the WHO classification, patients were classified as having refractory anemia (n=38), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (n= 20), MDS with isolated del(5q) (n= 18); refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (n=30); refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (n=22), refractory anemia with excess blasts-2 (n=31) and MDS-unclassifiable (n=7).
Train_Line_5848 A recent analysis of 47 patients with RARS-T strictly matching the 2008 WHO criteria showed that 41 of 47 (87%) subjects carried an SF3B1 mutation, 36 (77%) had JAK2 (V617F), and 30 (64%) had concomitant mutations in SF3B1 and JAK2.
Train_Line_5849 Notably the jumonji-domain-containing (JMJC) family, which are histone demethylase proteins, are also inhibited by 2-HG.
Train_Line_5850 The 2008 WHO diagnostic criteria for MDS are essentially based on morphology (erythroid dysplasia, ring sideroblasts, multilineage dysplasia, and excess of blasts), and include cytogenetics with respect to MDS with del(5q).
Train_Line_5851 We used the SPSS 17 and StatsDirect softwares to perform all statistical analyses.
Train_Line_5852 We identified a negative prognostic impact on OS and higher rate of AML transformation for SF3B1-wt/DNMT3A-mut patients.
Train_Line_5853 FLT3 mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_5854 The change meant that the gene became abnormally active.
Train_Line_5855 Briefly, optimized primers for PCR (shown in supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article) were designed against all coding exons of SF3B1 (CCDS33356, ENST00000335508).
Train_Line_5856 A screen for mutations within the C/EBPalpha gene coding sequence revealed that C/EBPalpha was mutated in approximately 7% of all patients with AML, and the results have since been reproduced and extended by other groups (Fig 3A and B).
Train_Line_5857 Mutation hotspots have been shown in the 3 most frequently mutated genes, ie, SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF1, and almost all described mutations are missense, with no evidence of nonsense or frameshift changes.
Train_Line_5858 For example, MDS del(5q) appears to derive from haploinsufficiency of genes mapping to chromosome 5q32-q33, in particular from reduced expression of RPS14, miR-145, and miR-146a, and from TP53 overexpression.
Train_Line_5859 We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P = 0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P = 0.009 for MLL-PTD, P = 0.05 for ASXL1, and P = 0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P = 0.05 for CEBPA and P = 0.01 for IDH2).
Train_Line_5860 Correlation of WT1 mutations with clinical features and immunophenotypes of leukemic cells.
Train_Line_5861 These data suggest that BCOR mutations define the clinical course rather than disease initiation.
Train_Line_5862 In inherited diseases, all HSC carry the mutation, whereas in sporadic MPNs the signaling mutation (JAK2V617F, MPLW515L, or BCR-ABL) is acquired by a HSC that must compete with wild-type HSCs.
Train_Line_5863 In summary, this study demonstrated that U2AF1 mutation could be detected in a substantial number of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_5864 Another mutation (at amino acid P904) is also recurrent in MDS and was detected in one de novo AML patient.
Train_Line_5865 It remains to be seen whether this will prove to be limiting in humans.
Train_Line_5866 Table 2. HR of Death Associated With Clinical Features and Mutations in Univariable Analyses.
Train_Line_5867 Notably, wild-type and PU.1 transactivated the CSF1R (M-CSFR) promoter 2.4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, but together synergized to induce 18-fold transactivation (Fig. 3e).
Train_Line_5868 The observation that spliceosome mutations are mainly founding mutations associated with different clinical outcomes has led Papaemmanuil et al to hypothesize that they give rise to initiating clones with different genetic predestination.
Train_Line_5869 Antibiotic prophylaxis.
Train_Line_5870 To further elucidate a role for DDX41 in the spliceosome, we expressed an epitope-tagged version of WT DDX41 in HEK293 cells and performed a mass spectrometry analysis of proteins associated with DDX41 in an antibody pull-down followed by peptide sequencing.
Train_Line_5871 The proto-oncogene CBL binds the SH2B3 family member SH2B2 (Yokouchi et al 1999) and a similar CBL recognition motif is found in the other family members, SH2B1 and SH2B3 (Hu & Hubbard, 2005).
Train_Line_5872 Flow cytometry determination of blast count should not be used as a substitute for morphologic evaluation.
Train_Line_5873 The calreticulin complex with endoplasmic reticulum protein 57, in the endoplasmic reticulum, suppresses the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of Stat3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
Train_Line_5874 Little is known about the incidence and prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in MDS patients.
Train_Line_5875 Patient characteristics.
Train_Line_5876 To improve their prognostication, risk-based stratification systems have been developed.
Train_Line_5877 As shown in Table 2, the most frequent mutation involved codon 700 (57.7% of all mutated cases), whereas lower frequencies were observed for mutations in codons 666 (10.7%), 662 (10.1%), 625 (6%), and 622 (7.1%).
Train_Line_5878 Design and Methods.
Train_Line_5879 Spliceosomal mutations induce splicing dysfunction (Przychodzen et al, 2013; Makishima et al, 2012), and our results indicate that DDX41 mutations also result in a specific missplicing pattern and altered expression of specific downstream genes.
Train_Line_5880 Recently, lymphocyte adaptor protein (LNK or SH2B3) has been reported as a new genetic abnormality in BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Train_Line_5881 Mutations in the TET2 gene are frequent in myeloid disease, although their biologic and prognostic significance remains unclear.
Train_Line_5882 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_5883 Nontumoral material from buccal swabs (n = 3) or peripheral blood CD31 T cells (n = 7) was analyzed for the presence of the identified variations when available.
Train_Line_5884 The absence of IDH1, IDH2, and DNMT3A mutations was not considered as an inclusion criterion for analysis, because these genetic alterations had not yet been discovered when the index patient was selected for whole-exome sequencing (WES).
Train_Line_5885 Patients with RAS mutations were more often nonwhite (P = .02) and had lower percentages of bone marrow blasts (P = .03).
Train_Line_5886 In germline GATA2 mutations carriers, only 16% remain asymptomatic by the age of 40 (Spinner et al, 2014).
Train_Line_5887 In the inactive state the activation loop obstructs access of substrates to the active site and the DFG sequence at its N-terminal end is incorrectly aligned for its role in catalysis.
Train_Line_5888 Sideroblastic erythropoiesis is a feature of pure RARS and other subtypes of MDS, but may also be associated with megakaryocytic proliferation and high platelet counts.
Train_Line_5889 Includes all AMLs with normal karyotype except for those included in the favorable subgroup; most of these cases are associated with poor prognosis, but they should be reported separately because of the potential different response to treatment.
Train_Line_5890 The pro-leukemogenic effects of BRCC3 mutations might be related to the impact of these lesions on tumor suppressive potential.
Train_Line_5891 Supernatants with equal viral titres were used in each experiment.
Train_Line_5892 First, it is known that NPM1-mutated AML is mostly negative for the stem-cell marker CD34, whereas NPM1 wild-type patients mostly express CD34.
Train_Line_5893 Transcription factors are master regulators of these graduated processes, and aberrations in their regulation/function can lead to loss of lineage identity, increased infidelity, lineage reprogramming, and malignant transformation.
Train_Line_5894 In contrast, several studies found no significant differences in outcome, including complete remission rates, overall survival, disease-free survival, event-free survival, or relapse-free survival, between patients with and without RAS mutations.
Train_Line_5895 WT SH2B3 and the SH2B3 PH domain mutants EQ and GV all localized to both the cytoplasm and the cell membrane (Figure S1).
Train_Line_5896 Mutations affecting mRNAsplicing define distinct clinical phenotypes and correlate with patient outcome in myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_5897 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_5898 The mutational spectrum for SRSF2 included P95L in 38 (42%) of the 90 SRSF2-mutated patients, P95H in 32 (35%), and P95R in 12 (13%) (Table II).
Train_Line_5899 After washing in 100% ethanol (twice for 10 min) and lysis in a digestion buffer (50 mmol Tris-HCL, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.5 mg proteinase K) an additional DNA purification step with NucleoSpin Blood (Macherey-Nagel, Duren, Germany) was performed.
Train_Line_5900 CONCLUSION.
Train_Line_5901 Hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors are the most obvious candidate drugs for evaluation.
Train_Line_5902 Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by the institutional review boards in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_5903 Younger adult patients are commonly categorized into 3 risk groups, favorable, intermediate, or adverse.
Train_Line_5904 Interestingly, in two patients with initially low allelic ratios for JAK2V617F, we observed an increase of the allelic ratio in the follow-up samples accompanied by an increase in platelet counts.
Train_Line_5905 Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare continuous variables and medians of distributions if the continuous data were not normally distributed.
Train_Line_5906 One caveat: every mutational event that inactivates TET2 may not have been identified.
Train_Line_5907 Beside its role in the cytokine receptor signaling cascade (Figure 1), JAK2 has been shown to influence chromatin structure (Figure 2).
Train_Line_5908 As specific molecular associations between mutations targeting epigenetic and splice activities were identified, we analyzed the prognostic impact of these molecularly defined genotypes.
Train_Line_5909 The occurrence of somatic DDX41 mutations was closely linked to the presence of DDX41 germline mutations.
Train_Line_5910 These observations indicate that KIT mutation is an early but insufficient event in GIST development, consistent with observations of familial GIST.
Train_Line_5911 IPSS-R, Higher group: intermediate, high and very high risk; Lower group, very low and low risk.
Train_Line_5912 All other lesions were confirmed as somatic or germ-line by analysis of CD3-sorted cells.
Train_Line_5913 In contrast, STAT3 is not activated by WT KIT signalling.
Train_Line_5914 JAK2V617F and MPL mutation analysis.
Train_Line_5915 The clinical variables, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, World Health Organization (WHO) subtype and the prognostic risk of all patients were ascertained at the time of sample collection.
Train_Line_5916 Concordant with our data, Illmer et al have recently shown that among younger (<60 years) patients with AML receiving high-dose cytarabine as induction therapy, activated RAS proteins predicted for a significantly higher response rate and longer overall survival.
Train_Line_5917 In multivariate analysis, when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence, and IDH1 mutation status, ASXL1 frameshift mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in MDS (overall survival: HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.34; P = .040; time to AML progression: HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.09; P = .024).
Train_Line_5918 PV or ET patients who are either intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea are effectively managed by INF-a (pegylated preparations preferred) or busulfan.

Train_Line_5920 All died 7, 17, and 28 months after MDS diagnosis.
Train_Line_5921 We identified missense mutations in PTPN11 in 21 of 62 individuals with JMML but without Noonan syndrome (34%; 95% confidence interval (c.i.) = 22--47%), with nine different molecular defects in exon 3 and one in exon 13 (Table 1).
Train_Line_5922 Table 1. Clinical, hematologic and morphological features of 28 patients with RARS-T.
Train_Line_5923 However, in contrast to Graubert et al, whose analysis of 150 MDS patients suggested an increased probability of secondary AML progression for patients with U2AF35 mutations, we observed no association between U2AF35 mutations and transformation to AML.
Train_Line_5924 Based on these data, the SF3B1 mutation status had a positive predictive value for disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts of 97.7% (95% CI, 93.5%-99.5%), whereas the absence of ring sideroblasts had a negative predictive value for SF3B1 mutation of 97.8% (95% CI, 93.8%-99.5%).
Train_Line_5925 In cooperation with NRAS oncogenic mutation the absence of ASXL1 triggered an MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_5926 Granulocyte DNA samples and matched normal DNA samples were collected from patients with PV, ET, and MF who were enrolled in the Harvard Myeloproliferative Disorders Study as previously described.
Train_Line_5927 The follow-up information was updated by means of clinic visits as well as telephone calls to patients, their doctors, and local registry offices.
Train_Line_5928 The benefits are closely balanced with the risks and burdens, and the best action may differ depending upon circumstances.
Train_Line_5929 However, in the presence of ATRA, p.Thr354Met alne enabled cell proliferation and/or survival (Fig. 4h) while simultaneously inhibiting differentiation and apoptosis (Fig. 4d,l and Supplementary Fig. 7). p.Thr355del appeared to be a null mutant under these conditions.

Train_Line_5932 TP53 mutations were also associated with shorter PFS (HR, 3.97; 95% CI, 2.22 to 7.10), and a trend toward shorter PFS for patients with DNMT3A mutations was observed (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 0.98 to 3.19; P = .061; Data Supplement).

Train_Line_5934 Whether a more significant loss of SH2B3 function, such as either homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation of the SH2B3 gene in conjunction with an activating JAK2 V617F mutation, would be deleterious on erythroid cells production, will require additional studies in the future.
Train_Line_5935 Human GATA2 cDNA sequence is available from GenBank under accession number NM_032638.4.
Train_Line_5936 There was no statistically significant difference in outcomes comparing patients with single or double TP53 mutations.
Train_Line_5937 In addition, variant comparisons were performed against dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP), and the occurrence of small indels was investigated using SEQUENCE Pilot Version 3.4 software (JSI Medical Systems).
Train_Line_5938 Both autologous and allogeneic stem cell recipients are at risk for transfusion-associated GVHD.
Train_Line_5939 Influence of ASXL1 mutation on clinical outcome.
Train_Line_5940 As such, it was not known which specific mutations occurred in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms without JAK2 or MPL mutations, nor was it known whether there were recurrent acquired mutations that activate the JAK2 pathway in this substantial subset of patients.
Train_Line_5941 Malignant clone: A clone generated by the occurrence in the parent cell of a somatic mutation that alters the cell biology and function.
Train_Line_5942 Thus, TP53 alterations appear to be one molecular basis for this purely descriptive cytogenetic subset.
Train_Line_5943 FLT3 analysis has been routinely performed on all patients with MDS and CMML evaluated at MDACC since 2003.
Train_Line_5944 In initial and/or sequential bone marrow trephines, 9/11 JAK2V617F positive and 6/12 negative patients fitted in an early or manifest fibrotic stage that we designated as RARS-T MF (p=0.19).
Train_Line_5945 Of the 51 patients, 44 and 7 were treated with 5-azacitidine and lenalidomide respectively.
Train_Line_5946 10.2 Reinduction of remission.
Train_Line_5947 In two of these patients a transition from JAK2V617F heterozygosity to homozygosity was documented and was accompanied by rising platelet counts in sequential samples.
Train_Line_5948 However, it is unlikely that KIT inhibitors alone can lead to cure.
Train_Line_5949 After a mean observation time of 2.1 years, 75.4% patients on anagrelide and 81.7% on hydroxyurea normalized their platelet count.
Train_Line_5950 Controlled studies are needed to clarify the advantage (or disadvantage) of IFN therapy in PV, compared to hydroxyurea therapy.
Train_Line_5951 Recent reports suggest the existence of pre-leukemic stem cells in MDS (Woll et al, 2014) and in AML (Shlush et al, 2014).

Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) for FLT3-mutated MDS patients versus FLT3-nonmutated MDS patients. The OS did not differ significantly for FLT3-mutated versus FLT3-nonmutated patients. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]
Train_Line_5953 In CMML, ASXL1 mutations also remained an independent adverse prognostic marker for time to AML progression, whereas the mutation did not retain its prognostic effect in AML in multivariate analysis.
Train_Line_5954 Our results were not conclusive but seemed to show greater destabilization of the auto-inhibited conformation of SHP-2 mutants associated with JMML and higher proliferation rate in cells expressing them, which would be compatible with the proposed model.
Train_Line_5955 This is in contrast with the mast cell lineage where KIT continues to be highly expressed in mature cells.
Train_Line_5956 Patients with ASXL1 frameshift mutations had a worse prognosis compared with that of wild-type patients in the group of patients treated with either ATG or lenalidomide, but not with thalidomide, respectively (ATG [n = 69], P = .001; lenalidomide [n = 17], P < .001; thalidomide [n = 9], P = .45; data not shown).
Train_Line_5957 BCOR is a key transcriptional regulator of early embryonic development, mesenchymal stem cell function, and hemopoiesis.
Train_Line_5958 This is well reflected by severe defects seen in myeloid development of mice with targeted deletions of genes encoding these key transcription factors.
Train_Line_5959 The PCR reaction included 95--degrees--C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95--degrees--C for 30 s, 61--degrees--C for 30 s and 72--degrees--C for 1 min.
Train_Line_5960 This patient displayed an allelic ratio of 38%T and his platelet count was borderline (596x109/L).
Train_Line_5961 Similarly, inhibition of Btk and Lyn with low-dose dasatinib (suboptimal for D816V KIT inhibition) combined with PKC412 (which effectively inhibits D816V), or with bosutinib and PKC412, blocked HMC-1 cell growth.
Train_Line_5962 Dnmt3b-/- mice die at 9.5 days post coitus (dpc) and display demethylation of minor satellite repeats, and the double mutant Dnmt3a-/-/Dnmt3b-/- mice are embryonic lethal at day 8.5 dpc with global demethylation.
Train_Line_5963 This interesting finding is worthy of further confirmation by studies on more patients.
Train_Line_5964 13.2 Growth factors.
Train_Line_5965 Further work will also need to be done to see if it is possible to develop drugs that can act on this gene mutation, or on the other genes that it affects so as to return the cells to normal.
Train_Line_5966 The investigators showed that down-regulation of ABCB7 led to markedly reduced erythroid growth in vitro with accumulation of mitochondrial ferritin in immature RBCs.
Train_Line_5967 Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities are detected in about half of patients with MDS, and the most common single cytogenetic aberrations include del(5q), trisomy 8, del(20q), and monosomy 7 or del(7q).
Train_Line_5968 The karyotype of the leukemic cells is the strongest prognostic factor for response to induction therapy and for survival.
Train_Line_5969 To date, among the 90 SRSF2-mutated patients, 74 (82%) deaths and 12 (13%) leukemic transformations have been recorded; the median survival of patients with SRSF2 mutations was 16 months and the leukemic transformation rate was 13%.
Train_Line_5970 A multivariate Cox regression analysis using variables including SRSF2 mutation and other known prognostic clinical factors on OS also showed that, after adjustments, the impact of SRSF2 mutation per se on OS vanished (Table 3).
Train_Line_5971 NS indicates not significant.
Train_Line_5972 They also had significantly longer disease duration and were more likely to have been treated with multiple drugs.
Train_Line_5973 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) primes and probes were designed for TP53 and GAPDH genes as per the protocol for the Universal Probe Library (Roche).
Train_Line_5974 Of note, the inactivating germline c.419insGATG mutation was not found among patients with del(5q35.3).
Train_Line_5975 Among them, the disease of 368 patients fulfilled the criteria of MDS according to the WHO 2008 classification.
Train_Line_5976 BM progenitor cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then stimulated with 10 iu/ml IL3.
Train_Line_5977 UPC 1932 and 2719 had no additional aberrations, whereas UPC 2306 had additional deletions at 4q21.22-q22.1 (7.3 Mb) and 4q34.3 (492 kb).
Train_Line_5978 Most patients with RARS carrying an SF3B1 mutation have a mutant allele burden between 40% and 50% in both circulating granulocytes and BM CD34-positive cells, indicating that the mutation occurs in a hematopoietic progenitor, determines expansion and dominance of a heterozygous clone, and is then transmitted to its myeloid progeny.
Train_Line_5979 Red blood cell transfusion.
Train_Line_5980 The canonical frameshift insertion in DDX41 might be more frequent than previously described germline RUNX1, CEBPA, and GATA2 defects (Owen et al, 2008; Hahn et al, 2011).
Train_Line_5981 Taken together, these data show that mutational analysis of a larger set of genetic alterations than that currently used in the clinic setting could be used to retrospectively classify patients with AML into more precise subgroups with favorable-risk, intermediate-risk, or unfavorable-risk profiles, with marked differences in the overall outcome.
Train_Line_5982 Conditional deletion of C/EBPalpha in GMPs allows for normal granulopoiesis in vitro, indicating that C/EBPalpha is not required for granulopoietic differentiation beyond the GMP stage.
Train_Line_5983 Variables with a P value of 0.05 or less in the univariate analysis for overall survival or event-free survival were included in the model.
Train_Line_5984 Interestingly, BCOR disruptive mutations were mostly enriched in the least characterized subgroup of CN-AML, those with germline NPM1, FLT3-ITD, IDH1, and MLL genes, mimicking the genotype of the AML index patient used for WES.
Train_Line_5985 All P values were two-sided, and P < 0.05 was significant.
Train_Line_5986 A number of non-specific recurrent mutations have been described in MDS including NRAS, TP53, RUNX1, and FMS, with the recent additions of TET2 and ASXL1.
Train_Line_5987 Defects of the helicase family were mutually exclusive (Figure S3B).
Train_Line_5988 A linker separates these 2 domains.
Train_Line_5989 In fact, the mutant allele trace peak heights were consistently equal to the normal allele trace peak heights for each sample and independent of the myeloblast count (p=0.40) (Supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_5990 IPSS-low indicates IPSS-low risk or intermediate-1; and IPSS-high, IPSS-high or intermediate-2.
Train_Line_5991 In CMML, Meggendorfer et al recently reported a prevalence of 47% for SRSF2 mutations in 275 patients, and found that these mutations did not affect OS or LFS.

Train_Line_5993 Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) is a phenotypically well-defined subtype of MDS characterized by erythroblasts with iron-loaded mitochondria, which are visualized by Prussian blue staining (Perls reaction) as a perinuclear ring of blue granules.
Train_Line_5994 Whole RNA-Seq.
Train_Line_5995 Mutations of type 1 (52-bp deletion; c.1092_1143del) and mutations of type 2 (5-bp insertion; c.1154_1155insTTGTC) accounted for 53.0% and 31.7% of all the cases with mutated CALR, respectively (Fig. 2C and 2D).

Train_Line_5997 Frequencies, response rates, and outcome measures should be reported by genetic group, and, if sufficient numbers are available, by specific subsets indicated; excluding cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_5998 CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DNMT3A MUTATIONS IN MDS.
Train_Line_5999 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6000 RESULTS.
Train_Line_6001 Patients with an early relapse (ie, duration of CR1 < 6 months), adverse cytogenetics, or older age have a poor outcome.
Train_Line_6002 PKC412 (midostaurin), which is currently under evaluation for treatment of FLT3 mutant AML, is also a very good inhibitor of D816V mutant KIT and has potential for treatment of cases of AML with this mutant as driver.
Train_Line_6003 JAK2 genotyping has become a major criterion in the diagnostic schema for MPN, and is pathognomonic for PV in the setting of clinical polycythemia.
Train_Line_6004 JAK2 exon 12 mutation-positive patients usually present with predominantly erythroid myelopoiesis, subnormal serum erythropoietin level, and younger age at diagnosis, but were prognostically similar to JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_6005 The panel met 4 times.
Train_Line_6006 In an elegant study, Busque et al found recurrent somatic TET2 mutations in elderly females who had clonal hematopoiesis demonstrated by X-chromosome inactivation skewing but no hematologic phenotype.
Train_Line_6007 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to presentation and clinical outcome.
Train_Line_6008 TP53 MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_6009 Applying the LR-PSS to our lower-risk MDS cohort, 25% of patients were assigned to risk category 3.
Train_Line_6010 The algebraic summation of these scores of each patient was the final score.
Train_Line_6011 Adverse cytogenetics is a strong independent prognostic factor for failure to achieve CR and OS.
Train_Line_6012 Methylation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 gene (SOCS3) in myeloproliferative disorders.
Train_Line_6013 Finally, t-AML is associated with a higher frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics.
Train_Line_6014 Loss-of-function studies of ASXL1 did not reveal a propensity for transformation to myeloproliferation or leukemia.
Train_Line_6015 The survival data are very similar to those of AML patients with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD.
Train_Line_6016 The mutations were heterozygous in all U2AF1-mutated patients.
Train_Line_6017 TP53 alterations in acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype correlate with specific copy number alterations, monosomal karyotype, and dismal outcome.
Train_Line_6018 Bone marrow cells were harvested directly or after 1- to 3-day unstimulated culture as previously described.
Train_Line_6019 Includes: R815k; D816F; I817V; ins V815_I817; D820G; E839K.
Train_Line_6020 We evaluated the incidence of acquired mutation of PTPN11 in 76 adults with acute or chronic myeloid malignancies and summarized our results together with others published recently.
Train_Line_6021 More than 20% blood or marrow blasts AND any of the following: previous history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN); myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormality (see below); multilineage dysplasia; AND absence of both prior cytotoxic therapy for unrelated disease and aforementioned recurring genetic abnormalities; cytogenetic abnormalities sufficient to diagnose AML with myelodysplasia-related changes are:
Train_Line_6022 OS was measured from the first diagnosis date to the date of last follow-up or death from any cause.
Train_Line_6023 Loss of TP53 was found in approximately 40% of CK-AMLs by array-based techniques, a value that corresponded well with that of 17p abnormalities found on chromosome banding analysis.
Train_Line_6024 Further, chromosomal aberrations at the 3q21 breakpoint cluster encompassing a presumptive GATA2 regulatory region resulted in upregulated GATA2 expression in MDS and AML.
Train_Line_6025 Purity of CD31 cells controlled by flow cytometry was at least superior to 95%.
Train_Line_6026 SuperSignal West Pico and West Dura Chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA) were used for detection.
Train_Line_6027 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6028 One important question with regard to JAK inhibitors and other targeted therapies is whether somatic mutations in the JAK-STAT pathway, or in specific epigenetic regulators, influence the response to targeted therapies.
Train_Line_6029 These mutations may have the potential to be biomarkers for monitoring of treatment response in MDS patients.
Train_Line_6030 The genes found mutated by WES of the index patient were further screened in 2 independent cohorts of 200 and 353 adult AML patients at first diagnosis, respectively.
Train_Line_6031 The frequencies of these gene mutations vary among cytogenetic groups.
Train_Line_6032 U2AF1 mutation may be used as a biomarker for risk stratification of MDS patients and to monitor the response of treatment.
Train_Line_6033 In addition, Ubc9 has been described to modify C/EBPalpha transactivation activity.
Train_Line_6034 Recurrently mutated genes in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are pathogenic drivers and powerfully associated with clinical phenotype and prognosis.
Train_Line_6035 The higher age of our patients with RARS-T (median age 71 years) compared to that of patients with either typical ET or PMF further supports the concept that the typical MPD/MDS phenotype may be determined by the acquisition of a variety of genetic and/or epigenetic changes.
Train_Line_6036 It catalyzes the carboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate.
Train_Line_6037 Furthermore, therapies are now being developed that target disease-associated molecular defects.
Train_Line_6038 The median follow-up for the entire cohort of patients with any of the three mutated genes was 5.7 years (range, 0 to 31).
Train_Line_6039 Survival of t-AML patients has been poor compared with that of patients with de novo AML.
Train_Line_6040 Patients who have an HLA-matched donor should be considered for allogeneic HSCT.
Train_Line_6041 In a subsequent Phase II trial conducted by this group, it showed considerable efficacy, but at the expense of substantial toxicity.
Train_Line_6042 Among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with a normal karyotype (CN-AML), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations define World Health Organization 2008 provisional entities accounting for approximately 60% of patients, but the remaining 40% are molecularly poorly characterized.
Train_Line_6043 Further analyses of 553 AML patients showed that BCOR mutations occurred in 3.8% of unselected CN-AML patients and represented a substantial fraction (17.1%) of CN-AML patients showing the same genotype as the AML index patient subjected to whole-exome sequencing.
Train_Line_6044 TP53 mutations were found in 141 of 234 (60%) and TP53 losses were identified in 94 of 234 (40%) CK-AMLs; in total, 164 of 234 (70%) cases had TP53 alterations.
Train_Line_6045 Like TET2 mutations, ASXL1 mutations are found in chronic and acute stages of myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_6046 Our data show that the presence of RAS mutations sensitize AML cells to highdose cytarabine therapy in vivo, suggesting that patients with AML having RAS mutations treated with chemotherapy alone should preferentially be administered high-dose cytarabine as postremission treatment.
Train_Line_6047 The safety and efficacy of busulfan treatment in ET was recently underlined by a long-term study of 36 patients above age 60 years of age; no instances of AML or other malignancies were documented after a median follow-up of 72 months.
Train_Line_6048 To identify the main actors of leukemic transformation in MPN, several teams have conducted comprehensive genotypic analyses of post-MPN-AML cells, with particular attention to both MPN- and AML-related genes.
Train_Line_6049 It was shown previously that depletion of SRSF2 contributes to genomic instability, which is a predictive marker for adverse outcome in MDS, and this could explain why SRSF2 mutations had a strong adverse impact.
Train_Line_6050 In AML, IDH mutations cluster with normal or intermediate-risk karyotype, sole trisomy 8 and NPM1 mutations.
Train_Line_6051 Contrasting with the presence of loosely distributed normal-sized megakaryocytes in the RARS phase (Figure 3B, C), an increase in megakaryocytes and an atypical clustering accompanied the transition into RARS-T and later RARS-T MF was paralleled by an increase of the JAK2V617F allelic ratio in specimens taken 8 months (Figure 3E, F) and 16 months after the initial sample (Figure 3 H. I).
Train_Line_6052 Clinical development of mutant-specific inhibitors of IDH1 and/or IDH2, EglN, and translocated MLL may further improve the need to identify these alterations in the clinical management of AML patients.
Train_Line_6053 In addition, the stability of this mutation during disease progression remains to be determined.
Train_Line_6054 The statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Train_Line_6055 Human CD34+ Colony Assays.
Train_Line_6056 To assess for factor-independent growth and for thrombopoietin hypersensitivity, cells were first washed three times in PBS, and then 1 x 105 viable cells/mL were resuspended in appropriate cytokine-free media or in media containing different concentrations of thrombopoietin (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) as noted.
Train_Line_6057 The presence of TET2 mutations existing as major/minor clones or single/multiple mutants was analyzed for association with conventional clinical and prognostic parameters as well as TET2 gene expression, JAK2V617F mutation, and 46/1 haplotype status.
Train_Line_6058 We detected SOCS3 promoter methylation in 32% (16/50) of patients with IMF but not in patients with PV, ET or myelofibrosis preceded by another MPD.
Train_Line_6059 TP53 gene expression.
Train_Line_6060 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_6061 Overall, SOCS3 promoter methylation was identified in 27% (16/60) of MF patients either by qualitative or quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Table 1).
Train_Line_6062 Thus, 15% of AML patients with a history of MDS had mutated IDH1 or IDH2.
Train_Line_6063 Because the characteristics of DNMT3A mutations have been described previously, we next focused on BCOR, a gene that has not been reported previously to be mutated in AML.
Train_Line_6064 MPNs are associated with a normal maturation but increased numbers of mature blood cells, except in PMF, in which abnormalities in MK differentiation might be responsible for the marrow fibrosis.
Train_Line_6065 JMML, a disorder with excessive proliferation of myelomonocytic cells, constitutes approximately 30% of childhood cases of MDS and 2% of leukemia.
Train_Line_6066 In multivariable analysis, TP53 alteration was by far the strongest prognostic factor for OS, followed by logarithm of WBC and age; of note, the cytogenetic category MK completely lost its prognostic impact.
Train_Line_6067 The negative impact of BCOR mutations on OS is observed in patients with low-risk (IPSS and intermediate-1 patients; P = .05) and in patients with high-risk MDS (IPSS intermediate-2 and high patients; P = .003; supplemental Figure 3A-B).
Train_Line_6068 Laboratory evidence of AvWS occurs in the majority of patients with ET or PV and is characterized by the loss of large von Willebrand factor multimers, linked to their increased proteolysis by the ADAMTS13 cleaving protease, in a platelet count-dependent fashion.
Train_Line_6069 We identified BCOR mutations in a total of 26 AML patients (14 female and 12 male), including 2 patients with NPM1 mutations (see "BCOR mutations are mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations").
Train_Line_6070 Approximately 5 x 104 sorted human CD34+ cells from healthy donors were plated on methylcellulose according to the MethoCult technical manual (H4230; StemCell Technologies).
Train_Line_6071 This was particularly true for patients with WHO categories defined by ring sideroblasts (RARS, RCMD-RS, and RARS-T), suggesting that somatic mutations of SF3B1 might be an early pathogenetic event in these patients.
Train_Line_6072 8.1 Patients age 60 to 74.
Train_Line_6073 It is now well established that IFN-a can control erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis in the majority patients with PV or ET (usual dose is 3 million units SC thrice a week).
Train_Line_6074 Importantly, EZH2 mutations remained a powerful and significant predictor of overall survival after adjustment for LR-PSS risk categories (HR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.85 to 4.52).
Train_Line_6075 Patients' samples.
Train_Line_6076 This may reflect differential effects of the various mutations on downstream signalling pathways (Section 3).
Train_Line_6077 Moreover, Western blot analysis shows ligandindependent phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins, which may effect both proliferation and differentiation.
Train_Line_6078 It is true that the sample size of CMML patients in the current cohort is too small to make a solid conclusion.
Train_Line_6079 Finally, we examined whether expression and/or methylation were associated with outcome and other clinical and laboratory variables.
Train_Line_6080 TP53 Sequencing.
Train_Line_6081 All criteria need to be fulfilled; marrow evaluation should be based on a count of 200 nucleated cells in an aspirate with spicules; if ambiguous, consider repeat exam after 5 to 7 days; flow cytometric evaluation may help to distinguish between persistent leukemia and regenerating normal marrow; a marrow biopsy should be performed in cases of dry tap, or if no spicules are obtained; no minimum duration of response required.
Train_Line_6082 The favorable effect of IDH2 mutations was found exclusively in patients with IDH2 R140Q mutations (P = 0.009) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_6083 This duplication was also detected in nontumoral CD3+ cells of 2 patients and therefore classified as a polymorphism.
Train_Line_6084 For multivariate analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was constructed for overall survival and event-free survival, adjusting for potential confounding covariates.
Train_Line_6085 As previously described, the presence of a JAK2 V617F mutation was associated with shorter survival (p=0.026).
Train_Line_6086 The precise function of DDX41 is not yet known, but an involvement of RNA helicases in RNA splicing has been proposed (Cordin et al, 2012; Staley and Guthrie, 1998; Schwer and Meszaros, 2000).
Train_Line_6087 Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates according to the cytogenetic status. (A) Data are shown for OS for CK+/MK- AML and CK+/MK+ AML. (B) Data are shown for OS for the subgroups CK+/MK-/TP53-unaltered, CK+/MK-/TP53-altered, CK+/MK+/TP53-unaltered, and CK+/MK+/TP53-altered.
Train_Line_6088 Although various approaches can be used to prove the existence of a clonal population of hematopoietic cells, the more straightforward one is the use of chromosomal abnormalities or discrete gene rearrangements to show the uniform presence of these markers in purified hematopoietic cell populations.
Train_Line_6089 I no longer use anagrelide for the treatment of PV or ET because of its reported association with increased risk of arterial thrombosis, major bleeding and fibrotic progression.
Train_Line_6090 A similar degree of benefit is appreciated in terms of reduction in spleen size or relief from pruritus.
Train_Line_6091 The characteristics of the study population were studied with appropriate statistical methods (Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables) comparing patients with TP53 mutation versus cases without mutation.
Train_Line_6092 Acute leukemia characterized by chromosomal rearrangements requires additional molecular disruptions to develop into full-blown malignancy, yet the cooperative mechanisms remain elusive.
Train_Line_6093 In the report of Rocquain et al, three of 65 MDS patients had both ASXL1 and RUNX1 mutations.
Train_Line_6094 There was also worse event-free survival (EFS) for patients with mutations (log-rank p=0.009) (Figure 2B).
Train_Line_6095 Significant genomic changes were selected based on size selection and overlap with known copy number variants from the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) as well as a cohort of 1003 healthy individuals (Iafrate et al 2004).
Train_Line_6096 Myeloid colony-forming assays were performed in methylcellulose-based medium (M3434) containing 3U/mL erythropoietin, 10 ng/mL IL-3, 10 ng/mL IL-6, and 50 ng/mL SCF, and in M3231 medium containing no additional cytokines, as per manufacturer's protocols (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada).
Train_Line_6097 The current diagnostic approach to MDS includes peripheral blood and bone marrow morphology to evaluate abnormalities of peripheral blood cells and hematopoietic precursors (Figure 1), bone marrow biopsy to assess marrow cellularity, fibrosis, and topography, and cytogenetics to identify nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities (Table 2).
Train_Line_6098 The data for 214 (67%) were censored at the last date they were known to be alive.
Train_Line_6099 Annotations by NCBI reference numbers of the genes affected by somatic mutations are summarized in Online Supplementary Table S2.
Train_Line_6100 The median follow-up of patients alive was 31 months.
Train_Line_6101 The MDS patients with FLT3 mutations were younger (60 vs. 68 years; P = 0.02) and tended to present as RAEB more frequently than MDS patients without FLT3 mutations (P = 0.03).
Train_Line_6102 Similarly, no clinical association was attributed to the size of the mutant clone (P = .921) or the presence of single versus multiple TET2 mutations (P = .627).
Train_Line_6103 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6104 Finally, some of the SH2B3 mutations occurring in haematopoietic disorders are frame shifts or stop codons that presumably destroy the function of SH2B3, again associated with loss of function (Oh et al 2010b; Pardanani et al 2010; Hurtado et al 2011; Roberts et al 2012).
Train_Line_6105 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS.
Train_Line_6106 In conclusion, BCOR mutations appear to be clonal, somatic, disruptive events that target the only functional allele not only in male, but also in female AML patients.
Train_Line_6107 In fact, the SF3B1 mutation status had a positive predictive value for disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts of 97.7% (95% confidence interval, 93.5%-99.5%), whereas the absence of ring sideroblasts had a negative predictive value for SF3B1 mutation of 97.8% (95% confidence interval, 93.8%-99.5%).
Train_Line_6108 Notably, in addition to a truncating mutation (NM_014159.6, c.6973C>T, p.Gln2325*; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3), the missense mutation (NM_014159.6, c.7515T>A, p.Phe2505Leu; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) affecting the second allele of SETD2 in the twin with leukemia mapped to the surface of the SRI domain (Fig. 3a) and corresponds to a key residue that is critical for the PCTD binding of SETD2 (ref. 18).
Train_Line_6109 Cytogenetic analysis.
Train_Line_6110 Expression of BCOR mRNA and protein in BCOR-mutated AML.
Train_Line_6111 Among 193 patients with MDS, follow-up information was available for 154 patients.
Train_Line_6112 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_6113 BCOR-mut MDS patients showed lower BCOR mRNA levels, suggesting the activation nonsense-mediate decay pathways.
Train_Line_6114 We studied 119 sequential samples at different time points for the emergence of TP53 mutated clones in 16% of patients (51 out of 318).
Train_Line_6115 Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Train_Line_6117 In the rare JAK2V617F-negative PV, different somatic gain-of-function mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 have been found.
Train_Line_6118 Proteins were subjected to 4-15% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Sigma).
Train_Line_6119 The serial study of SRSF2 mutation demonstrated the stability of this mutation during disease progression.
Train_Line_6120 However, carriers of the inactivating variant germline c.419insGATG acquire somatic hypomorphic rather than inactivating mutations.
Train_Line_6121 In contrast, this band was absent in all the BCOR-mutated AML samples (Figure 3C).
Train_Line_6122 Within MDS/MPN, future diagnostic criteria of RARS-T might include a combination of anemia and thrombocytosis as clinical parameters and a combination of SF3B1 and JAK2 or MPL mutations as molecular parameters.
Train_Line_6123 Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show the close association of IDH mutations with ASXL1, DNMT3A, and SRSF2 mutations, suggesting cooperation of IDH2 mutations with these genetic alterations may play a role in the development of MDS.
Train_Line_6124 CALR EXON 9 MUTATIONS IN OTHER MYELOID NEOPLASMS.
Train_Line_6125 In summary, this study demonstrated that SRSF2 mutation could be detected in a substantial number of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_6126 Intraclonal (intratumoral) heterogeneity.
Train_Line_6127 The p.R551W and p.I568T are missense variations located on exon 8, which encodes the C-terminal region of the LNK protein.
Train_Line_6128 In the absence of reticulin fibrosis, the megakaryocyte changes must be accompanied by increased marrow cellularity, granulocytic proliferation, and often decreased erythropoiesis (i.e. pre-fibrotic PMF). BM, bone marrow; Hgb, hemoglobin; Hct, hematocrit; Epo, erythropoietin; EEC, endogenous erythroid colony; WHO, World Health Organization; CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; PV, polycythemia vera; PMF, primary myelofibrosis; MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
Train_Line_6129 Abbreviation: NRM, nonrelapse mortality.
Train_Line_6130 IHC staining for TP53 protein on BM trephine showed a strong correlation with TP53 mutation status.
Train_Line_6131 Aspirin therapy is also considered to be adequate, and potentially useful in preventing complications during pregnancy, especially in JAK2V617F-positive cases.
Train_Line_6132 Interestingly, most of the mutations were located on the PH domain, which have led investigators to regard the PH domain as a mutational "hot spot".
Train_Line_6133 Allogeneic BMT data does indicate that eradication of the malignant hematopoietic clone in MF does result in complete reversal of fibrosis, and suggests that drugs that target mutant alleles such as MPLW515L may be effective disease-remitting agents.
Train_Line_6134 On the other hand, stronger binding to possible SH2B3 modifiers may also decrease its inhibitory effect.
Train_Line_6135 In support of this, for example, JAK2 V617F-negative ET patients frequently demonstrate features of a JAK2 V617F-positive MPD such as erythropoietin independent erythroid colonies, abnormal megakaryocyte morphology and overexpression of PRV-1.
Train_Line_6136 Furthermore, virtually all the other genes mutated in MPNs are in fact not specific to these disorders.
Train_Line_6137 Although imatinib is highly selective compared with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it also potently blocks the activity of KIT and PDGFR, suggesting a potential role in treatment of cancers driven by mutant forms of these receptors.
Train_Line_6138 Using sensitive next generation technology, we have recently shown TP53 mutations in almost a fifth of low risk MDS patients with isolated del5q, including low abundance mutant clones (Jadersten et al 2011).
Train_Line_6139 Thirty (33%) patients with SRSF2 mutations had 1% RS, with 13 (43%) demonstrating 15% RS.
Train_Line_6140 This phenomenon cast doubts on the appropriateness of mutated WT1 as a surrogate marker in monitoring minimal residual disease.
Train_Line_6141 The difference in megakaryocyte colony growth and morphology was not explained by a difference in ploidy of megakaryocyte cells in MPLW515L compared with MPLWT bone marrow cells (Figure 6C).
Train_Line_6142 Candidate mutations were confirmed using native genomic DNA.
Train_Line_6143 These data include the germline S505N allele in MPL associated with familial ET, the W515S mutation that has been reported as a spontaneous mutation in Ba/F3 cells stably transduced with MPL, and the observation that in vitro deletion of the RWQFP domain that includes W515 results in MPL activation.
Train_Line_6144 Based on values for mutant allele burden or variant allele frequency.
Train_Line_6145 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_6146 Only two patients (3.5%) treated with busulfan alone developed acute leukemia.
Train_Line_6147 We therefore assessed the localization of the SH2B3 PH domain mutants with confocal microscopy.
Train_Line_6148 CK-AMLs account for 10% to 15% of adult AMLs, and the frequency increases with age.
Train_Line_6149 In the studies by Klampfl et al and Nangalia et al, investigators performed exome sequencing of paired myeloproliferative neoplasms and normal DNA to identify recurrent mutations in the gene encoding calreticulin (CALR) in the majority of patients with nonmutated JAK2 or MPL.
Train_Line_6150 In addition, prophylaxis may not be as efficacious if other modes of prophylaxis are used, for example, high-efficiency particulate (HEPAR) air filtration.
Train_Line_6151 Patient-specific barcodes, adapted to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers in the second round of amplification were derived from the Roche GS Titanium protocol (Roche).
Train_Line_6152 TP53 sequence analysis.
Train_Line_6153 This is highlighted by several multiple-mutant cases here, where we see one dominant and one low-abundance population, suggestive of clonal competition.
Train_Line_6154 All 13 mutations were confirmed as somatic by repeat sequencing of the paired tumor/normal DNA samples (Supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_6155 In our MDS patient cohort, TET2 mutations were the most common (54 of 221, 24.4%), whereas mutations in ASXL1 (37 of 221, 16.4%), DNMT3A (26 of 221, 11.6%), RUNX1 (16 of 221, 7.1%), TP53 (13 of 221, 5.8%), IDH1/2 (12 of 221, 5.3%), CBL (11 of 221, 4.9%), JAK2 (9 of 221, 4%), EZH2 (7 of 221, 3.1%), ETV6 (2 of 221, 0.9%), and NRAS (2 of 221, 0.9%) were less frequent.
Train_Line_6156 However, we found that the SRSF2 mutation was not an independent poor prognostic factor, and its impact on OS might be a reflection of the close association of this mutation with old age.
Train_Line_6157 Early trials of imatinib in unselected cases of AML were unsuccessful (e.g., [71]), probably due to the relatively low rate of KIT mutations (around 7% overall) and the frequency of resistant D816 mutations.
Train_Line_6158 Thus far, in CMML, SRSF2 mutations have not been shown to carry an independent prognostic impact.
Train_Line_6159 Progression of the disease is typically associated with the acquisition of somatic mutations in driver genes responsible for subclonal evolution.
Train_Line_6160 SH2B3 EQ inhibited maximal STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation slightly less than WT SH2B3, while the inhibition of STAT5 and ERK phosphorylation by SH2B3 GV was noticeably less than WT SH2B3.
Train_Line_6161 Twenty-five patients had missense mutations, including P95H in 13 patients, P95L in 9, P95R in 2, and P95A in 1.
Train_Line_6162 4.2 Immunophenotyping.
Train_Line_6163 We then assessed the effects of DNMT3A mutational status on the outcome according to treatment group and found that high-dose daunorubicin was associated with an improved rate of survival among patients with mutant DNMT3A (P = 0.04) (Fig. S11A in the Supplementary Appendix) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A (P = 0.15) (Fig. S11B in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_6164 BRCC3 mutations were associated with higher age in the whole cohort [mean+=standard deviation, 67+=13 in wild-type (WT) and 72+=10 in mutants; P=0.01].
Train_Line_6165 Acute myeloid leukemia-related precursor neoplasms include "therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome" and "myeloid sarcoma."
Train_Line_6166 The somatic nature of this deletion was verified by sequencing CD3+ cells from one patient.
Train_Line_6167 The median age was 65 years (17-89 years) and median follow-up was 45 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 27-62 months].
Train_Line_6168 All 106 patients showed single heterozygous mutation. (Supplementary Table 1) All these mutations resulted in truncation of the plant homeodomain of ASXL1.
Train_Line_6169 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NTUH.
Train_Line_6170 Later on, chronic neutrophil leukemia, hypereosinophilic syndromes, systemic mastocytosis, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, and other rare chronic hemopathies were added.
Train_Line_6171 Here, we report that somatic defects of BRCC3 are acquired in various myeloid neoplasms and have consequences at the cellular, and perhaps the clinical level.
Train_Line_6172 Table 4. Sequential studies in the 8 MDS patients with SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_6173 There was one patient (<0.5%) who had the MPL W515L mutation; a 61-year-old male with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, mild thrombocytopenia and a normal karyotype.
Train_Line_6174 The central part of ASXL1 contains an ASXH globular domain that may interact with a polycomb-associated deubiquitinase (DUB).
Train_Line_6175 Other alterations in ASXL1, ASXL2 and ASXL3.
Train_Line_6176 PCR amplification conditions were the same for both U2AF35 reactions and included a primary denaturation of 95--degrees--C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of: 95--degrees--C for 30 sec, 57--degrees--C for 45 sec, and 72--degrees--C for 45 sec; and ended with a final extension of 72--degrees--C for 5 min.
Train_Line_6177 Our results for the first time implicate BCOR in CN-AML pathogenesis.
Train_Line_6178 The accurate determination of prognosis is particularly critical for the selection of appropriate therapy for patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_6179 Fumo et al showed that the chaperone protein, Hsp90 binds to mutant forms of KIT (including D816V) in HMC-1 mast cell leukaemia lines.
Train_Line_6180 There was no obvious impact of U2AF1 mutation on OS among different MDS risk groups (Supporting Information Fig. 1A-G).
Train_Line_6181 SF3B1 encodes a protein involved in the spliceosome pathway.
Train_Line_6182 These findings are of major interest as they link two pathways involved in the pathophysiology of MDS.
Train_Line_6183 ASXL1 is affected by somatic deletions as well as point mutations in patients with all myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_6184 The ASXL1 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in malignant myeloid diseases.
Train_Line_6185 In some cases novel compounds targeting post-translational modifications of histones and DNA cytosine modifications appear to result in potent and specific inhibition of specific enzymatic activities.
Train_Line_6186 PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing. SOCS3 promoter CpG island methylation was quantified using a Stratagene MX3000P sequence detection system (Stratagene, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Train_Line_6187 Subsequent studies identified JAK2 exon 12 mutations in patients with JAK2 V617F-negative polycythemia vera and mutations in the gene encoding thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) in a subset of patients with JAK2 V617F-negative essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_6188 Moreover, by doubling sequence depth yet again for 13 of these patients, no additional TET2 mutations were discovered, suggesting that the moderate sequencing depth achieved in the primary mutation screen was adequate in identifying the majority of mutant cases.
Train_Line_6189 The median survival of patients with SF3B1 mutations was 17 months, and to date, 12 (92%) deaths and 2 (15%) leukemic transformations have been recorded.
Train_Line_6190 A quantitative real-time RT-PCR-based allelic discrimination assay was used for detecting the JAK2 (V617F) mutation and evaluating granulocyte mutant allele burden applying the standard curve method.
Train_Line_6191 The data of serial studies in another 107 patients, who did not have WT1 mutation either at diagnosis or at relapse, are not shown in this table.
Train_Line_6192 Indeed, previous studies clearly indicated that the risk of leukemic evolution is low in patients with RARS, a notion indirectly confirmed also by our observation that only 2 of 38 (5.3%) patients with AML evolving from MDS carried a somatic mutation of SF3B1.
Train_Line_6193 Also, MPLW515L mice develop rapidly fatal disease. These differences between the murine model and the human phenotype are likely accounted for by the retroviral transduction model of disease, and is similar to what has been observed for the rapidly fatal BCR-ABL-mediated disease in the murine BMT model as compared with human CML.
Train_Line_6194 PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_6195 Analysis of JAK2 downstream signalling pathway by phospho-flow (Fig 4B-C) demonstrated that the SH2B3 PH domain mutants inhibited unstimulated STAT5 phosphorylation slightly less than WT SH2B3 while WT and mutant SH2B3 inhibited ERK phosphorylation to similar extents.
Train_Line_6196 Furthermore, when nonmutant patients with TET2 mRNA expression levels less than the 95th percentile (n = 15) were included together with cases having a TET2 mutation, OS remained nonsignificant (P = .77).
Train_Line_6197 A similar frequency was previously reported in AML patients, suggesting that altered cohesin function plays a role in myeloid leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_6198 It should be noted that RCMD-RS was a separate MDS category in the 2001 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms but was incorporated into RCMD in the 2008 revision.
Train_Line_6199 RESULTS.
Train_Line_6200 Our study warrants confirmation but suggests consideration of the BCOR gene in the diagnostic workup of MDS patients.
Train_Line_6201 Of note, the global level of 5hmC may not directly impact the mC level as evaluated on a gene-specific base because TET2-mutated patients have lower mC in MDS samples and greater mC in AML samples.
Train_Line_6202 However, use of prolonged intensive consolidation, or of multiagent chemotherapy does not appear to be superior to HiDAC alone.
Train_Line_6203 Other response criteria are cytogenetic CR (CRc) and molecular CR (CRm; Table 5).
Train_Line_6204 Global DNA methylation is shown as percent methylation of a methylated control DNA, which was provided by the manufacturer.
Train_Line_6205 Considering the variant allele frequency, some mutant genes, typically those of RNA splicing and DNA methylation, appear to be mainly associated with the initial clonal proliferation, whereas others are mainly involved in subclonal evolution (Table 3).
Train_Line_6206 In all 10 investigated patients, more than 75% of BM cells are affected by the initiating mutation, confirming previous observations of an early clonal dominance in MDS pathogenesis.
Train_Line_6207 Methylation analysis of SOCS1 CpG islands.
Train_Line_6208 Moreover, ASXL1 mutation was associated with distinct clinical and biological features and a poorer outcome.
Train_Line_6209 Myeloproliferative neoplasms are clonal hematopoietic disorders that manifest as expansion of one or more myeloid lineages.
Train_Line_6210 These findings suggest that C/EBPalpha is an important regulator of growth control and DNA damage response in the skin.
Train_Line_6211 Defective function of DDX41 may constitute a vulnerability of affected cells and provides a rationale for synthetic lethal intervention.
Train_Line_6212 The most common KIT mutations found in melanoma are L576P and K642E, encoded within exons 11 and 13, respectively.
Train_Line_6213 Individual small series report CR rates of 40% to 50%.
Train_Line_6214 Here we report a highly specific c.1061C>T (p.Thr354Met) heritable mutation in GATA2 co-segregating with early onset MDS-AML in three families.
Train_Line_6215 Current data support the hypothesis that acquired changes modulate JAK2 kinase activity and modify the MPD phenotype.
Train_Line_6216 The effects of SF3B1 mutations may also be unrelated to the splicing activity of the protein.
Train_Line_6217 Myelodysplasia is not restricted to MDS but may be found also in other myeloid neoplasms of the WHO classification (Table 1).
Train_Line_6218 The 293T cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and the packaging cell line Plat-E was generously provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; Morita et al 2000).
Train_Line_6219 WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THERAPY?

(B) Event-free survival in MDS patients (n=153) with mutated (n= 7) and unmutated (n=146) IDH1 (log-rank test, P=0.02).
Train_Line_6221 A reduction in mutant clone correlated with response to 5-azacitidine, however clones increased in nonresponders and persisted at relapse.
Train_Line_6222 Subjects.
Train_Line_6223 Missense mutations were excluded because their significance could not be verified owing to lack of normal tissue for comparison, not being reported previously or not at the sites well conserved among different species (data not shown).
Train_Line_6224 Although mutations in RAS are frequent in AML and seem to contribute to leukemogenesis in a subset of patients, their prognostic significance has not been firmly established.
Train_Line_6225 The recent WHO classification reflects the fact that an increasing number of acute leukemias can be categorized based upon their underlying cytogenetic or molecular genetic abnormalities, and that these genetic changes form clinico-pathologicgenetic entities (Table 1).
Train_Line_6226 Patients' Samples.
Train_Line_6227 In this regard, treatment is tailored to individual patients according to their risk for thrombosis or bleeding (Table IV).
Train_Line_6228 Figure 2. Schematic representation of our current understanding of the pathophysiology of myelodysplasia. In this example, the founding driver mutation is assumed to occur in a hematopoietic cell located in the bone marrow of the right ilium, and the sternum is shown as an anatomically separated bone marrow district to illustrate the concept of mutated stem cell migration through peripheral blood. Bone marrow microphotographs: magnification from 600X, courtesy of Erica Travaglino.
Train_Line_6229 The frequency of mutations in LNK is low.
Train_Line_6230 Melanoma.
Train_Line_6231 Specifically, this region, encoded by exons 8 and 9, directly mediates dimer interactions.
Train_Line_6232 Cells were treated by spin infection with retroviral supernatants (1 mL supernatant per 4 x 106 cells, plus polybrene) and centrifuged at 1,800 g for 90 minutes.
Train_Line_6233 Recurrent somatic mutations, which are drivers of MDS pathogenesis and can be powerfully associated with clinical phenotype, are not currently incorporated into the routine clinical care of patients with this disorder.
Train_Line_6234 Intermediate-risk AML.
Train_Line_6235 At an early stage of evaluation it was noted that clinically relevant KIT mutants differed greatly in their sensitivity to imatinib.
Train_Line_6236 Finding better molecular prognostic markers in MDS remains a major challenge in treating the disease because of the heterogeneity in the clinical course.
Train_Line_6237 Transfection of Setd2 shRNA led to decreased levels of Setd2 expression and H3K36me3, whereas H3K79me2 and H3K27me3 were minimally affected in the Mll-Af9 knock-in cells (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 13).
Train_Line_6238 This suggests that the initial somatic TET2 mutation occurred in a CD34+ CD38- cell and was then transmitted to its CD34+ CD38- progeny.
Train_Line_6239 Clinical studies have suggested showed discrete associations with JAK2 mutational status and disease phenotype.
Train_Line_6240 Although higher-risk patients with MDS (IPSS intermediate-2 or high-risk groups) are typically treated with hypomethylating agents or considered for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, lower-risk patients are usually offered less aggressive therapies, including hematopoietic growth factors, transfusion support, or simply active observation without treatment.
Train_Line_6241 The presence of the peptide sequence derived from the alternative reading frame at the C-terminal domain of mutated CALR offers an opportunity for immunologic targeting because it represents a cancer-specific epitope.
Train_Line_6242 C/EBP alpha As a Lung Cancer Tumor Suppressor.
Train_Line_6243 A marrow (and blood) specimen should routinely be taken for molecular diagnostics.
Train_Line_6244 In 65 busulfan-treated patients with PV followed between 1962 and 1983, median survival was 19 years in patients whose disease was diagnosed before age 60 years.
Train_Line_6245 Although ASXL1 functions are related to the PRC2 complex, which includes EZH2, ASXL1 and EZH2 mutations are not mutually exclusive.
Train_Line_6246 The association between TET2 mutation status and clinical variables is shown in Table 1.
Train_Line_6247 Chromosomal abnormalities are found in approximately 55% of adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are among the most important independent prognostic factors.
Train_Line_6248 This leads to the subsequent recruitment of U2 snRNP, containing SF3A1 and SF3B1 to establish the splicing A complex.
Train_Line_6249 Ring sideroblasts are erythroblasts with iron-loaded mitochondria visualized by Prussian blue staining (Perls reaction) as a perinuclear ring of blue granules.
Train_Line_6250 Affymetrix Single nucleotide polymorphism 6 (SNP6) analysis.
Train_Line_6251 Nine (69%) of the 13 SF3B1-mutated patients had 1% BM RS, of which 3% had <15% RS, 26% had 15-49% RS and 43% had >50% RS.
Train_Line_6252 JAK kinases possess 2 highly homologous domains at the carboxyl terminus: an active kinase domain (JAK homology, JH1) and a catalytically "inactive" pseudokinase domain (JH2).
Train_Line_6253 Bioinformatical analyses allowed the identification of 8 somatically acquired mutations including ACOX1, BCOR, DPF2, EIF5B, GPR179, RUNX1, STAG2, and ZNF354C (Table 2), which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (data not shown).
Train_Line_6254 Mononuclear cells were labeled with CD34 MicroBeads, and CD34+ cells were isolated using MACS magnetic cell separation columns (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Train_Line_6255 After these exclusions, 87 patients were included in the analysis cohort.
Train_Line_6256 In the limited reports in literature regarding WT1 mutation in AML patients afflicted with abnormal cytogenetics, the mutation was also found in patients with t(15;17), t(8;21), t(6;9), and 11q23 abnormalities.
Train_Line_6257 As outlined above, more than 80% of GISTs have activating mutations in KIT and a further ~5% have mutations in PDGFR.
Train_Line_6258 The probability of achieving a first CR was similar between patients with and without WT1 mutations (75% vs 75.2%, P = .985).
Train_Line_6259 SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 (U2AF1) are the three most frequent genes involved with spliceosome mutations in myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_6260 Defects in DNA repair acquired in the malignant clone may create a leukemia cell-specific vulnerability, if it leads to a greater number of residual DSBs 24 h after their induction.
Train_Line_6261 More specifically, SF3B1 mutation appears to be strictly associated with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with or without marked thrombocytosis,
Train_Line_6262 In multivariate analysis, the mutational prognostic schema predicted the outcome independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and transplantation status (adjusted P<0.001).
Train_Line_6263 Moreover, studies of these compounds and the impact of inhibiting epigenetic complexes on epigenomic patterning and on normal HSCs, differentiation, and homeostasis are in their earliest stages.
Train_Line_6264 For methylation-specific PCR, the primers described above were utilized.
Train_Line_6265 Details of the methods and analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Train_Line_6266 LNK is a negative regulator of thrombopoietin (TPO)MPL and erythropoietin (EPO)-EPO receptor-mediated JAK2 activation.
Train_Line_6267 Patients with t-AML should be encouraged to participate in prospective trials that are designed for other AML patients with similar genetic changes.

Train_Line_6269 Leukaemic progression was seen in 23 cases (45%).
Train_Line_6270 Located in the nucleus, the BRCA1-A complex consists of UIMC1, FAM175A, BABAM1, BRE, BARD1, BRCC3 and BRCA1 and participates in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair.
Train_Line_6271 For most patients with MDS, this would not be a viable option, because of advanced age or comorbid diseases.
Train_Line_6272 As in the index family, they also showed the somatic DDX41 (p.R525H) mutation.
Train_Line_6273 To ensure comprehensive coverage of DNMT3A we performed bidirectional sequencing of all amplicons in the 150 paired DNA samples, producing 16,890 reads.
Train_Line_6274 It must be stated that we may be missing information about additional therapies patients may have received after their initial therapies.
Train_Line_6275 When we cultured CD34+ cells with knockdown of DDX41, decreased levels of DDX41 resulted in a higher sensitivity to growth factor stimuli compared to control (Figures 4D and 4E).
Train_Line_6276 Based on these results, azacitidine has been approved for older AML with 20% to 30% blasts. While these results are promising, data for more proliferative AML are currently not available.
Train_Line_6277 Epo stimulation in erythroid progenitors leads to activation of JAK2 and its three major downstream pathways, STAT5, PI3K-AKT and RAS-MAPK.
Train_Line_6278 Figure 2. LFS of 226 patients with CMML stratified by spliceosome mutation status. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.].
Train_Line_6279 Our data indicate that there are distinct clinical and genetic characteristics in MDS with different gene mutations even though the mutations involve the same mRNA-splicing machinery.
Train_Line_6280 The presence of mutational hotspots in SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 suggests gain-of-function mutations in these genes, all of which encode for proteins belonging to the splicing E/A complex.
Train_Line_6281 Patients with FLT3-ITD or wild-type NPM1/wild-type FLT3 correspond to the NPM1/FLT3 high-risk group, in which DNMT3A mutations were associated with shorter OS, RFS, and lower CR rates in our analysis.
Train_Line_6282 Median (range).
Train_Line_6283 It has been shown previously that the p.Phe2505Leu alteration blocks the binding of SETD2 to the PCTD of RNA Pol II at the target gene locus.
Train_Line_6284 Both JAK2V617F and MPL mutations also occur infrequently in other myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_6285 Although genome-wide mapping studies of 5hmC in the hematopoietic system have not yet been reported, genome-wide mapping of 5hmC in embryonic stem cells has identified that 5hmC is most often present at transcription start sites and within gene bodies.
Train_Line_6286 Based on preliminary data from ongoing anti-JAK2 clinical trials, I suspect that JAK inhibitors might become the most effective agents for the treatment of MPN-associated pruritus.
Train_Line_6287 The strong family history and late onset suggest high penetrance with long disease latency.
Train_Line_6288 PCR products from the first round SOCS3 methylation-specific quantitative PCR were cloned.
Train_Line_6289 Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_6290 All the 43 patients analysed either had complex karyotype or isolated deletion 5q.
Train_Line_6291 Among the 142 patients who had no IDH mutations at diagnosis, 68 of them had disease progression including 48 with leukemic transformation during this period.
Train_Line_6292 Abbreviations: FAB, French-American-British classification; RA, refractory anemia; RARS, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts; RAEB, refractory anemia with excess blasts; RAEBT, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; RCUD, refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia; RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia.
Train_Line_6293 To validate the results of in vitro studies, we performed xenograft experiments with cell lines in which DDX41 was knocked down and demonstrated accelerated tumor growth compared to mock transduced cells (Figure 4G).
Train_Line_6294 To further determine the role of Setd2 during the maintenance or progression of established leukemia, we obtained primary Mll-Af9 or MLL-NRIP3 leukemia cells from the leukemic mice (Figs. 1c and 5).
Train_Line_6295 One mutation (A215V) had been previously described in PMF blast crisis, and another (E208X) leads to absence of the PH and SH2 domains as the mutant described in PMF.
Train_Line_6296 In strictly WHO-defined ET, a recent study has revealed that prognosis is even better than previously assumed.
Train_Line_6297 Finally, targeting the myeloid-associated antigen CD33 by the use of anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody has become an interesting new approach.
Train_Line_6298 Such a model will explain the occurrence of JAK2 wild-type leukemia in JAK2V617F-positive MPNs, whereas, in contrast, the linear accumulation of mutations in the JAK2V617F-dominant clone will favor the progression of MPN to myelofibrosis and leukemia.
Train_Line_6299 We selected one representative sAML case in which deletion with haploinsufficient DDX41 expression was confirmed by SNP-A and quantitative RT-PCR.
Train_Line_6300 Unlike the case with PV, the PVSG did not carry out large scale randomized studies in ET.
Train_Line_6301 Evidence for this hypothesis comes from several observations in mice and human disease: (1) mouse studies requiring biallelic TP53 inactivation and a concomitant "second hit" for myeloid leukemogenesis demonstrated that p53-lost myeloid progenitors exhibit aberrant self-renewal, thereby promoting AML; (2) in high-risk MDS and/or AML evolving from a 5q- syndrome, the expansion of preexisting TP53 mutated subclones was observed; and (3) recently, next-generation sequencing of a therapy-related CK-AML genome identified several acquired genetic lesions and a heterozygous intragenic germline TP53 deletion, becoming homozygous in AML as a result of acquired UPD(17p), a mechanism possibly underlying the sequential TP53 inactivation in patient 96 (supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_6302 This suggests, however, a broader target, namely, any member of either the BRCA1-A or BRISC complexes might be capable of incapacitating the entire complex.
Train_Line_6303 Physicians decide to give treatment to some patients but not others based on generally accurate perceptions of how patients will fare after such treatment, or on strict protocol exclusion criteria.
Train_Line_6304 C/EBPalpha has also recently been implicated in the regulation of the microRNA miR223, with C/EBPalpha-mediated upregulation of miR223 leading to granulocytic differentiation in a myeloid differentiation model.
Train_Line_6305 Several reports addressed that WT1 mutation was an independent poor risk factor for overall survival (OS) in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients.
Train_Line_6306 Furthermore, the presence of a bulky substituent, either naturally as in the case of FLT3, or through mutation as in T670I KIT, obstructs binding of imatinib and related drugs such as nilotinib, and also dasatinib conferring resistance.
Train_Line_6307 Of the 7 patients who carried a U2AF35 mutation and were wild-type for ASXL1, one had progression to AML and died 10 months after MDS diagnosis.
Train_Line_6308 It binds to the 3 homodimeric "myeloid" receptors (erythropoietin receptor [EPO-R], myeloproliferative leukemia [MPL; TPO-R], G-CSF receptor [G-CSF-R]), to the prolactin and growth hormone receptors, to heterodimeric receptors (GM-CSF-R, IL-3-R, and IL-5-R, which share the common beta chain of IL-3-R and the gp130 family of receptors), and to IFN-gamma R2.
Train_Line_6309 There is also evidence that outcome may be more related to the level of the mutated allele, rather than its mere presence, or to the insertion site of the ITD.
Train_Line_6310 Those interacting with U1 and U2 snRNAs in the early phase of intron recognition and spliceosome formation include SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, U2AF65, SF1, SF3B1, SF3A1, and PRPF40B (Table 1).

Train_Line_6312 PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified and sequenced as described elsewhere.
Train_Line_6313 These findings suggested that though SRSF2 mutation may play a role in the development of MDS, it is not associated with the disease evolution.
Train_Line_6314 The median follow-up for patients alive (n = 55) is 12.9 years, ranging from 4.3 to 18.8 years.
Train_Line_6315 Similarly, Shih et al analyzed 150 patients with MDS (RAEB-T not included) and identified FLT3-ITD mutations in only 5 (2.5%) patients.
Train_Line_6316 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_6317 Further exploration showed that the prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutation might be attributed to its close association with old age.
Train_Line_6318 Total 42 DNA samples that had been extracted and stored from peripheral blood or bone marrow of MPN patients between 2007 and 2010 were used.
Train_Line_6319 However, much fewer aberrations have been described in MDS than in AML, and even less is known about the functional and prognostic roles of the aberrations.
Train_Line_6320 Therefore, JAK2 and the 3 "myeloid receptors" form functional units and have been shown to be required for the promotion of JAK2V617F signaling.
Train_Line_6321 Evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) occurs in approximately 25% of cases.
Train_Line_6322 Moreover, they show a complete lack of granulocytes, while blasts accumulate in the bone marrow, suggestive of an early block in myeloid maturation.
Train_Line_6323 Patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis who had nonmutated JAK2 were tested for mutations in MPL exon 10.
Train_Line_6324 This is highlighted in MPN cases in whom TET2 mutations were only detected at the time of myeloid leukemic transformation.
Train_Line_6325 Survival was similar in patients treated with antithymocyte globulin, thalidomide, or best supportive care compared with all other patients (data not shown).
Train_Line_6326 In contrast, Gelsi-Boyer et al considered frameshift and point mutations for their prognostic effect in CMML.
Train_Line_6327 In a recent study, mutations in 5 of these genes have been found to be predictors of poor overall survival (OS), independently of established risk factors.
Train_Line_6328 Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been very important thus far for diagnosis and prognostication of MDS.
Train_Line_6329 The majority of mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 were heterozygous point mutations (n = 33; Figure 1A); 9 frameshift and 2 nonsense mutations were also observed.
Train_Line_6330 PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS.
Train_Line_6331 In a recent study, IDH2 mutation, but not IDH1 mutation, was identified as a poor prognostic factor in MDS patients.
Train_Line_6332 Because the regulation of RNA splicing is important for normal cell function, genetic alternation in SRSF2 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of MDS.
Train_Line_6333 As predicted, activating KIT mutations have also been observed in germ cell cancers.
Train_Line_6334 Our results demonstrate that splice gene mutations are among the most frequent molecular aberrations in myelodysplastic syndrome, define distinct clinical phenotypes, and show preferential associations with mutations targeting transcriptional regulation.
Train_Line_6335 However, the DNMT3A-mutant/SF3B1-wild-type subgroup did have shorter OS.
Train_Line_6336 To detect low-abundance mutant clones, we resequenced 96 patient samples, including TET2 mutant and nonmutant cases, at much greater depth (450X vs 130X), and for 13 of these patients at an average coverage of 950X.
Train_Line_6337 Pair-wise comparisons were performed by Wilcoxon test for continuous variables and by two-sided Fisher exact for categorical variables.
Train_Line_6338 We and others propose that assessment of somatic mutations probably improves both diagnosis and prognostication in patients with MDS, although a few simple parameters (eg, the degree of anemia) will continue to be of pivotal importance for risk assessment.
Train_Line_6339 More recently, however, mutations in the Polycomb group of proteins have been found in patients with all myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_6340 It is interesting to note that 33% (n = 10) of patients with TP53 mutation harboured double mutant clones, and of these, 70% had a normal 17p status by SNP array karyotyping.
Train_Line_6341 Results are for data collected as of May 2013.
Train_Line_6342 This makes detailed risk stratification of MDS patients important.
Train_Line_6343 Since that time, considerable progress has been made in elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of the disease that has resulted in the identification of new diagnostic and prognostic markers.
Train_Line_6344 The most appropriate risk group assignment for a number of the rarer cytogenetic abnormalities, for example, del(7q), isolated trisomy 8, del(9q), t(v;11)(v;q23) other than t(9;11), and del(20q), remains uncertain due to limitations of sample size and differences in treatment schedule among studies.
Train_Line_6345 All the mutations of CALR we identified are insertion or deletion mutations in the last exon encoding the C-terminal amino acids of the protein.
Train_Line_6346 Our results indicate that MDS patients with mutated IDH1 undergo a high rate of leukemic transformation, which is in accordance with the data in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_6347 Salvage treatment was performed with the s-HAM regimen (sequential high-dose Ara-C, mitoxantrone, plus GM-CSF), followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation with fludarabine and treosulfan as the conditioning regimen.
Train_Line_6348 All 270 HapMap samples were homozygous for the wild-type MPLW515 allele.
Train_Line_6349 Case reports suggest that ruxolitinib may be effective in CNL associated with CSF3R mutation and in chronic eosinophilic leukemia associated with a PCM1-JAK2 fusion gene.
Train_Line_6350 Failure was the result of insufficient sequence coverage.
Train_Line_6351 In cytogenetically normal (CN) AML, 27.2% harbored DNMT3A mutations that independently predicted shorter OS (HR = 2.46; 95% CI, 1.58 to 3.83; P < .001) and lower CR rate (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.84; P = .015), but not RFS (P = .32).
Train_Line_6352 The remaining 5 patients (UPC 1326, UPC 1625, UPC 2844, UPC 2984, and UPC 1740) had no genomic aberrations associated with chromosome 4q24, but had additional aberrations as follows: UPC 1326 had UPD6q14.1-q15 (8.8 Mb), UPC 1625 had del 7q22.1 (736 kb), and UPD had 7q22.1-q36.3 (57 Mb), UPC 2844 had del 12p13.2 (277 kb), UPC 1740 had del 6q12.1-11.2 (2.1 Mb), and UPC 2984 had del 17p132.1-p13.1 (1.6 Mb), gains on 13q34 (518 kb), and 17q25.3 (751 kb) and UPDs on chromosomes 13 q13.3-q14.2 (10.4 Mb), q21.1-q21.33 (13.2 Mb), and q33.1-q34 (10.2 Mb).
Train_Line_6353 BRCC3 mutations commonly occurred in nonsense (n=12), frameshift (n=4), and splice site (n=5) configurations.
Train_Line_6354 Furthermore, in children, somatic mutations of PTPN11 have been reported in 34% of non-syndromic JMML, 18.5% of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) in transformation, 4% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 6.5% of acute lymphocytic leukemia (Table 1); 98% of those mutations were localized in exon 3.
Train_Line_6355 No hypermethylation of the SOCS1 promoter region was detected in normal individuals or in 68 MPD patients (Figure 1B, Table 1).
Train_Line_6356 DNMT3A mutations were found in 87 (17.8%) of 489 patients with AML who were younger than 60 years of age.
Train_Line_6357 Several patient and disease features are known to affect survival after HSCT for MDS, including patient age, sex, karyotype, and disease burden before transplantation.
Train_Line_6358 Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus, and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_6359 The molecular mechanisms underlying genetic predestination remain to be defined.
Train_Line_6360 No patient received SCT in first complete remission.
Train_Line_6361 WT SH2B3 bound JAK2 while the SH2B3 RE mutant nearly lost this binding ability, as expected.
Train_Line_6362 The cumulative incidence of thrombosis in essential thrombocythemia was calculated with a competing-risk approach, with death from any cause as a competing event; the curves are shown in Figure 4C, and the data are provided in Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Train_Line_6363 Much has been learned about the role of C/EBPalpha in tissue development and differentiation from the study of C/EBPalpha-/- knockout mice (Fig 1A).
Train_Line_6364 Hydroxyurea was better in terms of reducing the risk of arterial thrombosis, major bleeding, and fibrotic progression.
Train_Line_6365 At initial diagnosis, various grades of reticulin fibrosis ranging from absence (score 0; Figure 1J) to slight increase in fiber density (score 1; Figure 1K) or a moderate (score 2; Figure 1L) were present in 12 patients.
Train_Line_6366 In addition, up-modulation of DDX41 reversed the relative apoptotic resistance of U937 cells (Figure S5G).
Train_Line_6367 Variables with P <= .1 in univariate analysis for OS were included in the model.
Train_Line_6368 Mutational hotspots of U2AF1 and SRSF2 were also sequenced in 50 healthy volunteers.
Train_Line_6369 In contrast to some recent reports, we observed no favorable impact on OS for patients with SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_6370 In conclusion, the link between JAK2V617F mutational status and prognosis, as well as the transition from heterozygosity to homozygosity and the relatively high frequency of a homozygous status that we found in our patients indicate that RARS-T displays distinct clinicopathological and molecular features which are different from those of classical ET and PMF.
Train_Line_6371 Altogether, the available evidence suggests that spliceosome mutations affecting the 39 splice site recognition and U2 snRNP function are likely to create novel protein isoforms that can drive clonal dominance of mutated hematopoietic stem cells.
Train_Line_6372 Secondary mutations identified in this way involve a limited number of sites.
Train_Line_6373 A growing number of recurring genetic changes have been recognized in the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification of AML.
Train_Line_6374 The cytogenetic risk group is defined according to Medical Research Council criteria.
Train_Line_6375 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6376 RESULTS.
Train_Line_6377 For the patients with discrepancy of the mutation status of the ASXL1 in paired samples, Taq polymerase-amplified (TA) cloning was performed in the samples without detectable mutant by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_6378 Occult GIST "tumorlets" are frequently found in the stomachs of older individuals at autopsy.
Train_Line_6379 Using whole-exome sequencing of an MDS patient, we identified a somatic mutation in the BCOR gene also mutated in AML.
Train_Line_6380 PATIENTS.
Train_Line_6381 All CMV-seronegative HSCT recipients with seronegative donors should receive CMV-seronegative blood products.
Train_Line_6382 Mutational hotspots were specifically sequenced for SF3B1 (exon 12-16), SRSF2 (exon1), U2AF35 (exon 2 and 6), ASXL1 (exon 12), CBL (exon 7, 8 and 9), FLT3 (internal tandem duplication/tyrosine kinase duplication), NRAS/KRAS (codon 12/13 and 61), JAK2 (exon12 and14), IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R140/R172), BRAF (exon 11 and 15), MPL, KIT and NPM1. (Table SIb).
Train_Line_6383 A single patient with 5q- and TP53 mutation showed no alteration in the clone size following treatment with lenalidomide and also did not progress to AML.
Train_Line_6384 development for frontline therapy of AML.
Train_Line_6385 This analysis showed no significant difference in OS among DNMT3A-mutated patients with a related donor as compared with patients without a related donor; however, at 5 years, more patients with a related donor were still alive as compared with patients without a related donor.
Train_Line_6386 C/EBPalpha As a Master Regulator of Airway Epithelial Differentiation.
Train_Line_6387 Somatic SF3B1 mutations are found almost exclusively in patients with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts without or with thrombocytosis (RARS and RARS-T, respectively), and this clearly suggests a causal relationship between mutation and ring sideroblast formation.
Train_Line_6388 All patients were risk stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) categories.
Train_Line_6389 Nonsynonymous mutation: A nucleotide mutation that alters the amino acid sequence of a protein.
Train_Line_6390 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_6391 The MPL W515L was identified in two ET patients, and neither of them harbored LNK or JAK2 V617F mutations.
Train_Line_6392 In 2008, the World Health Organization recommended changing the term myeloproliferative disorders to myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
Train_Line_6393 Hematologic and survival data of the JAK2V617F positive vs. the JAK2V617F negative patients were statistically analyzed.
Train_Line_6394 Considering that the ATM gene maps on chromosome 11q22-q23, and that 2 patients had point mutations in both ATM and SF3B1 but did not have del(11q), the above enrichment suggests that SF3B1 mutations may be synergistic with loss of ATM.
Train_Line_6395 Combining the LR-PSS and EZH2 mutation status identifies 29% of patients with lower-risk MDS with a worse-than-expected prognosis.
Train_Line_6396 If TP53 mutations are associated with resistance to specific conditioning regimens or indicative of rapidly progressive disease, standard transplantation may not be a viable therapeutic option for this patient population.
Train_Line_6397 TET2 mutation screen.
Train_Line_6398 In contrast, none of the 58 patients who had no SRSF2 mutation initially acquired a novel mutation during follow-ups, suggesting that this mutation might play little role in MDS progression.
Train_Line_6399 An evolution into BP occurred in two JAK2V617F negative patients, but in none of the positive patients.
Train_Line_6400 However, in CMML, the main observed association was BCOR-mut/U2AF1-mut.
Train_Line_6401 The patients with ASXL1 mutation had significantly higher incidences of concurrent RUNX1 mutation (32.4% vs 6.8%, P<0.001), EZH2 mutation (22.6% vs 1.1%, P<0.001), IDH mutation (11.4% vs 2.5%, P<0.001), NRAS mutation (10.4% vs 3.1%, P = 0.007), JAK2 mutation (3.8% vs 0.3%, P = 0.011), SETBP1 mutation (10.5% vs 0.6%, P<0.001) and SRSF2 mutation (34.3% vs 6.7%, P<0.001), but had a lower incidence of concurrent SF3B1 mutation (2.9% vs 12.9%, P = 0.003) than those with wild-type ASXL1.
Train_Line_6402 Among 193 patients with MDS, seven patients (3.6%) had a heterozygous mutation in codon 132 of IDH1.
Train_Line_6403 Multivariable analysis stratified again for age at a cut-point of 60 years revealed TP53-altered (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.56-3.77; P = .0001), logarithm of WBC (HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.17-2.26; P = .004), and age (HR for 10-year difference, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.56, P = .04) as significant variables; not significant for OS were platelet counts, cytogenetic MK, and s/t-AML (Table 2).
Train_Line_6404 Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of a TET2 mutation did not influence overall survival (odds ratio [OR]: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.98-1.25; P = .08).
Train_Line_6405 Conclusions.
Train_Line_6406 SH2B3 WT, EQ and GV bound CBL, as well as 14-3-3.
Train_Line_6407 At relapse, 3 of the 16 WT1-mutated patients who had paired samples lost the mutation and 2 acquired additional mutations, whereas 3 of 110 WT1-wild patients acquired novel mutations.
Train_Line_6408 Overall survival (OS) end points, measured from the date of first sample collection, were death (failure) and alive at last follow-up (censored).
Train_Line_6409 Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) SOCS1 and SOCS3 are negative regulators of the JAK/STAT pathway and are therefore attractive candidates.
Train_Line_6410 Finally, it may be possible to target downstream signalling pathways that are required for KIT-dependent growth.
Train_Line_6411 In multivariate analysis, DNMT3A mutations had an independent unfavorable prognostic effect on OS in patients with CN-AML (HR = 2.46; 95% CI, 1.58 to 3.83; P < .001, Data Supplement Table S3) when considering age, platelet count, NPM1/FLT3-ITD risk group, CEBPA mutation status, WT1 SNP rs16754 status, and BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MN1, and MLL5 expression levels.
Train_Line_6412 A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Train_Line_6413 MPL mutation scanning was performed using high resolution melting analysis, and mutations were then verified using Sanger sequencing.
Train_Line_6414 Chemotherapy delivered during the second and third trimester of pregnancy has been reported as safe, although stillbirths and low birthweight have also been observed.
Train_Line_6415 Third, CALR mutations are observed in purified stem or progenitor cells from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms and remain stable during disease evolution.
Train_Line_6416 Interestingly, using a more sensitive cloning technique, we could identify ASXL1 mutation in one of the 11 clones, but no RUNX1 and SETBP1 mutations in the 41 clones and 40 clones analyzed at diagnosis, respectively.
Train_Line_6417 Within the cohort, 289 patients with MDS were evaluated based on the IPSS score at the time of diagnosis.
Train_Line_6418 In addition, subcloning analysis confirmed biallelic TP53 alteration by compound heterozygous mutations in 8 patients.
Train_Line_6419 The median RMA for all patients is 43% for bone marrow, 38.5% CD34+ cells, 23.5% for CD3+ cells, and 5% for germline (skin) tissue.
Train_Line_6420 Given that both Kosmider studies were retrospective in nature, it is possible that patient selection bias in either study could also have contributed to the disparity in observations.
Train_Line_6421 Its molecular basis has been recently elucidated by means of massive parallel sequencing studies.
Train_Line_6422 Among the 23 patients with WT1 mutations at diagnosis, all lost their mutations at remission status (Table 5).
Train_Line_6423 BCR-ABL1--positive leukemia may present as mixed phenotype acute leukemia, but should be treated as BCR-ABL1--positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
Train_Line_6424 This finding suggests that JAK2V617F confers only a weak advantage to HSC.
Train_Line_6425 Given the previously documented role of MLL fusion protein-SPECIALCHAR<feff> mediated H3K79 methylation in leukemogenesis, it was of great interest for us to explore whether a distinct epigenetic pathway represented by SETD2-H3K36 could be a cooperative event in the development of MLL-rearranged leukemia.
Train_Line_6426 We used the massively parallel pyrosequencing NGS technique (Roche GS FLX), which, because of its relatively long sequence reads, is particularly suitable for mutation screening through exonic PCR amplicons.
Train_Line_6427 Methanol/acetic acid-fixed cell pellets should be stored so if cytogenetic analysis fails, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is an option to detect gene rearrangements, such as RUNX1-RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, MLL and EVI1 gene fusions, or loss of chromosome 5q and 7q material.
Train_Line_6428 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6429 Colony forming efficiency with either Epo or IL3 was assessed (Figs 1A and B).
Train_Line_6430 The cost effectiveness of growth factors is difficult to assess and has been inconsistently reported, but there does not seem to be significant cost savings.
Train_Line_6431 Mathematical models predict that at least 1%-2% of the HSC need to carry the JAK2V617F mutation to produce the clinical phenotype.
Train_Line_6432 RESULTS.
Train_Line_6433 Importantly, in 9 of 11 patients, CD3+ cells had a reduced, but significant, mutation load, compared with total bone marrow and CD34+ cells, maintaining a mutant allele burden of >= 14% (median, 23.5% RMA) and indicating a very early event affecting a primitive stem cell.
Train_Line_6434 The highest mutation frequency was found in patients with CN-AML (71 [27.2%] of 261 patients).
Train_Line_6435 In ten patients, the myelofibrosis was secondary to a pre-existing MPD (5 PV, 5 ET).
Train_Line_6436 IPSS: Low, 0; intermediate (Int)21, 0.5-1; Int-2, 1.5-2; and High,>2.5.
Train_Line_6437 or In the absence of reticulin fibrosis, the megakaryocyte changes must be accompanied by increased marrow cellularity, granulocytic proliferation, and often decreased erythropoiesis (i.e., pre-fibrotic PMF).
Train_Line_6438 In this review, we will focus on the current molecular knowledge of the BCR-ABL-negative MPNs PV, ET, and PMF.
Train_Line_6439 In this article, we will review the most recent advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of myelodysplasia and will discuss its clinical relevance.
Train_Line_6440 The incidence and impact of FLT3 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is unknown.
Train_Line_6441 Fifty-eight (18%) patients underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) after the time of sample collection and hence survival analysis was censored at the date of HSCT.
Train_Line_6442 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_6443 Three patients were found to have two DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_6444 Of them, 4 mutations (V382fsx385, N381fsx450, Q380fsx384, and S381X) occurred in more than one patient (nos. 1 and 7, 4 and 5, 6 and 16, and 9, 28, and 31, respectively).
Train_Line_6445 In this study, ASXL1 mutations were identified in 106 (22.7%) of the 466 patients with primary MDS based on the French-American-British (FAB) classification and 62 (17.1%) of the 362 patients based on the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.
Train_Line_6446 From the original clone, a complex combination of mutations that does not follow a linear dynamics may give rise to different subclones.
Train_Line_6447 Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that dysplastic features were not restricted to the JAK V617F negative patients (Figures 2A-D; patient n. 511; JAK2 V617F 0%T) but were also present in mutated cases (Figure 3 EI; patient n. 510; JAK2 V617F 78%T).
Train_Line_6448 A similar retrospective study in 164 patients with ET treated with pipobroman as first-line therapy (starting dose 1 mg/kg/day) and followed for a median of 100 months, AML occurred in 5.5% of the cases.
Train_Line_6449 Induction of C/EBPalpha expression occurs in close temporal proximity to the initiation of cellular differentiation in the developing lung.
Train_Line_6450 Recently, studies have shown that somatic mutations of PTPN11 can be found in children with myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_6451 Although the constitutively active JAK2V617F mutant kinase is present in many patients with MPD, there are a significant proportion of MF and ET patients who are JAK2V617F-negative.
Train_Line_6452 The molecular pathogenesis MPN have become more clearly annotated with regard to the role of recurrent somatic and germline mutations which both drive unrestricted outgrowth and alter transcriptional programming though epigenetic modification.
Train_Line_6453 An alternate or additional approach may be to target the stability of the mutant KIT protein.
Train_Line_6454 To evaluate whether the inferior survival associated with SRSF2 mutations was attributed to the age effect, we performed survival analysis restricted to the patients older than 50 years; in this group of patients, SRSF2 mutation did not influence the OS (Figure 1I).
Train_Line_6455 In multivariable analysis (Table 3 and Fig 2B), these patients had a significantly lower relapse rate than the patients with non-CBF AML with mutated RAS who were randomly assigned to LDAC (HR = 0.29; P = .008).
Train_Line_6456 Somatic mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators.
Train_Line_6457 Mutations in DNMT3A are independently associated with a negative prognosis, especially in patients with CN-AML belonging to the NPM1/FLT3-ITD high-risk group.
Train_Line_6458 There appeared to be a higher rate of intermediaterisk karyotypes with mutated ASXL1 (P = .002), especially in the IPSS low and intermediate-1 groups (data not shown), but this evaluation is limited by the low number of patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk cytogenetics.
Train_Line_6459 We conclude that SRSF2 is the most frequently mutated spliceosome gene in CMML but neither it nor SF3B1 or U2AF35 mutations are prognostically relevant.
Train_Line_6460 Paired-end massively parallel sequencing was performed on the Illumina Genome Analyzer GAIIx for 2 x 108 cycles using the Chrysalis sequencing kit Version 4.0.
Train_Line_6461 More specifically, the initial driver mutation would shape the future trajectory of clonal evolution through constraints on the repertoire of cooperating genetic lesions.
Train_Line_6462 Originally described as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBL was also recently recognized as a multiadaptor protein and a positive regulator of signal transduction (Schmidt & Dikic, 2005).
Train_Line_6463 The intriguing finding that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur in the leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms, but not in patients in chronic-phase polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, suggests that these mutations play an important role in leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_6464 Although these conflicting results may stem from variation in the pretreatment features of patient populations analyzed in different series, they may also be related to differences in treatment regimens used.
Train_Line_6465 A number of these compounds are already in phase 1 trials for patients with AML and a larger number of compounds are in preclinical development.
Train_Line_6466 Nitrocellulose membrane was blocked in TBST/5% milk and incubated with one of the following antibodies: anti-pSTAT5 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, Massachusetts, United States), anti-pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling), anti-pERK (Cell Signaling), anti-pAKT (Cell Signaling), anti-pTYK2 (Cell Signaling), or anti-pJAK2 (Cell Signaling).
Train_Line_6467 LNK belongs to a family of adaptor proteins possessing several domains: a proline-rich N-terminal dimerization domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue.
Train_Line_6468 In a non-randomized study by the PVSG, treatment with hydroxyurea was associated with a lower incidence of early thrombosis compared with a historical cohort treated with phlebotomy alone (6.6% vs 14% at 2 years).

Train_Line_6471 LNK.
Train_Line_6472 In this study, the IDH mutations were detected in 4.6% of 477 de novo MDS patients diagnosed according to the FAB classification, 0.6% with IDH1 and 4.0% with IDH2 mutations, and in 2.2% of those diagnosed according to the 2008 WHO classification, 0.3% with IDH1 and 1.9% with IDH2 mutations.
Train_Line_6473 A total of 1778 patients were enrolled in this study (Online Supplementary Table S1).
Train_Line_6474 The enhanced skipping of this exon, located in the 5' UTR was recapitulated by DDX41 knockdown in K562 and CD34+ cells.
Train_Line_6475 I would also argue that hydroxyurea-refractory PV or ET is often adequately managed by treatment with busulfan or IFN-a.
Train_Line_6476 Myelodysplasia is a diagnostic feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) but is also found in other myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_6477 Figure 3. OS and time to AML progression in MDS patients. OS (A) and time to AML progression (B) in MDS patients with IPSS low/intermediate-1 risk according to SRSF2 mutation status (log-rank test) are shown.
Train_Line_6478 Despite these technical challenges, a number of compounds have been developed which appear to target specific epigenetic-regulatory proteins or processes.
Train_Line_6479 Of note, a recurrent heterozygous mutation at residue Arginine 882 accounts for 40% to 60% of DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_6480 A recent large international study confirmed the prognostic relevance of distinguishing ET from pre-fibrotic PMF.
Train_Line_6481 Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications and not necessarily survival or risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation (Table IV).
Train_Line_6482 Although the TP53 gene had been sequenced and studied extensively before the era of large scale sequencing, the methods applied were not sensitive enough to identify small clonal mutant populations.
Train_Line_6483 IDH1 gene encodes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate1 (NADP1)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) residing in the cytosol and peroxisomes while IDH2 encodes the enzyme residing in the mitochondria.
Train_Line_6484 In each of the 7 patients studied, in fact, progression to AML was characterized by the persistence of the antecedent founding myelodysplastic clone and the emergence of >=1 subclone harboring new somatic mutations.
Train_Line_6485 12.4 Pregnancy.
Train_Line_6486 However, there was no significant difference in the length of survival between patients with SOCS3 promoter methylation and those without (p=0.67) (Figure 4).
Train_Line_6487 DNMT3A mutations were found in 87 (17.8%)of 489 patients with AML.
Train_Line_6488 AML with mutations in NPM1 or CEBPA have been incorporated in the WHO classification as provisional entities.
Train_Line_6489 Nevertheless, we found that patients with a TET2 or DNMT3A mutation were at increased risk of relapse and death after transplantation, particularly when other predictive variables were considered.
Train_Line_6490 Overall, 193 patients with MDS and 65 healthy volunteers were examined for ASXL1 mutations by direct sequencing and for expression levels of ASXL1.
Train_Line_6491 TABLE IV. Sequential Studies in the 15 MDS Patients With U2AF1 Mutation.
Train_Line_6492 A retrospective study from the Cooperative German Transplant Study Group of 368 patients (median age, 57 years; range, 50-73) suggests that matched unrelated and matched sibling donor allogeneic HSCT (72% had received RIC regimens) result in comparable survival in older AML patients.
Train_Line_6493 However, these mutations do not appear to be specific for MDS because they also occur in other myeloid malignancies at variable frequencies.
Train_Line_6494 Number (%) of patients showing the specific gene mutation listed in the far left column among the U2AF1-wild or U2AF1-mutated group.
Train_Line_6495 The mechanism of this low penetrance susceptibility is unknown.
Train_Line_6496 In one of the two studies, 77 cases were evaluable after a median follow-up of 21 months and 76% and 70% of patients with ET or PV, respectively, achieved a complete hematologic remission, mostly in the first 3 months; side effects were recorded in 96% of the patients and 22% had discontinued treatment.
Train_Line_6497 In particular, the mutation(s) responsible for JAK2V617F-negative ET and MF remain to be identified.
Train_Line_6498 Adults diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and no prior history of exposure to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were included in the study.
Train_Line_6499 Hence, inactivation of SOCS3, for example by methylation, may not offer a proliferative advantage in JAK2 V617F-positive PV patients.
Train_Line_6500 Analysis of acquired data was performed with the Ion torrent v2.2 software (Life Technologies).
Train_Line_6501 Recently, mutations of the additional sex comb-like 1 (ASXL1) gene were identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but the interaction of this mutation with other genetic alterations and its dynamic changes during disease progression remain to be determined.
Train_Line_6502 ASXL1 is the second most frequently mutated gene in MDSs after TET2.

Train_Line_6504 The genomic region that spans the wild-type R132 of IDH1 (exon 4) was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the following primers: 5`TGTGTTGAGATGGACGCCTATTTG and 5`TGCCACCAACGACCAAGTCA as previously described.
Train_Line_6505 RCMD-RS indicates refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_6506 For all French MDS patients, the coding sequences of BCOR (ENST00000378444) and BCORL1 (ENST00000218147) were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (see supplemental Table 5 for primer sequences).
Train_Line_6507 However, subgroup analysis demonstrated a significant correlation of U2AF1 mutation with shorter TTL in the patients with lower-risk disease, whether it was defined by the IPSS (low and intermediate-1, 46.5 vs. 197.4 months, P = 0.008, Fig. 2D), by the WHO classification (RA, RARS, refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia [RCUD], and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia [RCMD], with/without ring sideroblasts, 46.5 months vs. not reached, P < 0.001, Fig. 2E), or by FAB classification (RA and RARS, 46.5 months vs. not reached, P < 0.001, Fig. 2F).
Train_Line_6508 SOCS1 and SOCS3 CpG island methylation was then assessed in 73 patients with a MPD and in 34 normal individuals.
Train_Line_6509 The multi-amplicon panel included 62 genes.
Train_Line_6510 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6511 Recent estimates using high sensitivity mutation detection techniques indicate that JAK2V617F is present in ~95-100% of PV, 60%-70% of ET, and 50% of MF.
Train_Line_6512 The presence of DDX41 mutations or deletions was associated with responsiveness to lenalidomide.
Train_Line_6513 Therapy-related AML (t-AML) is a recognized clinical syndrome occurring as a complication after cytotoxic and/or radiation therapy.
Train_Line_6514 - Complex karyotype (defined as 3 or more chromosomal abnormalities).
Train_Line_6515 Briefly, two separate PCR reactions were performed and the primers used were as follows: (for S34) Forward: 5'-GGTGCTTAATACCACGGAAAA-3'; Reverse: 5'-AGTCGATCACCTGCCTCACT-3'; (for Q157) Forward: 5'-GCCTCGTGTGCATTCTCTG-3'; Reverse: 5'-CTTTTCAGTTTCGCCGTGAG-3'.
Train_Line_6516 An interesting difference was noted between patients with KIT mutations in exon 11 (~65%) and those with mutations in exon 9 (~10%), with the former group having stronger, more durable responses.
Train_Line_6517 After a final extension at 72--degrees--C for 2 min, the products were confirmed by 1.3% agarose gel and purified using Qiagen's PCR Quick Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA).
Train_Line_6518 In particular, patients with poor prognostic features may be directed to transplantation because they have few treatment options available or because standard therapeutics are not expected to provide durable responses.
Train_Line_6519 Conventional cytogenetics analysis is a mandatory component in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected acute leukemia.
Train_Line_6520 The mutation occurred most frequently in patients with refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEBT) (14.3%) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) (11.3%), but similarly in patients with other subtypes: 1.7% in refractory anemia (RA), 2.9% in RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS), 2.5% in refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB).
Train_Line_6521 These results allowed us to develop a prognostic schema that integrated our findings from the comprehensive mutational analysis with cytogenetic data to identify three risk groups: a group with a favorable-risk profile (median survival, not reached; 3-year rate of overall survival, 64%), a group with an intermediate-risk profile (median survival, 25.4 months; 3-year rate of overall survival, 42%), and a group with an adverse-risk profile (median survival, 10.1 months; 3-year rate of overall survival, 12%) (Fig. 3A and 3B, and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_6522 Abbreviations: AML, acute myeloid leukemia; ECOG, performance status of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; FAB, French-American-British classification of acute myeloid leukemia; FLT3-ITD, internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene.
Train_Line_6523 Mutation analysis of key exons of KIT is now technically straightforward, relatively inexpensive and is economically justified in view of the high cost of the drugs as well as patient benefit.
Train_Line_6524 In the presence of protein truncating mutations, IHC may not detect the altered TP53 protein.
Train_Line_6525 This pattern of c-KIT expression and function has predicted the cancers in which KIT abnormalities, typically mutations leading to constitutive activation of the intrinsic kinase, are crucially involved (reviewed [2]).
Train_Line_6526 Table 5. Sequential studies of WT1 mutations in AML patients.
Train_Line_6527 Table 1. Comparison of Clinical and Molecular Characteristics of Patients With MDS and With Mutated or Wild-Type ASXL1.
Train_Line_6528 In all four families, the GATA2 mutations were associated with early onset MDS and/or AML, with highly penetrant autosomal dominant inheritance resulting in poor outcome unless successfully transplanted (for example, in pedigree 1, the age of death from AML ranged from 10-50 years, two individuals aged 58 and 62 years have the mutation but no disease, and all other siblings without the mutation are alive or have lived beyond 53 years of age) (Supplementary Tables 2,3 and Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_6529 However, these data are based on a small number of studies, and only one of these addressed both TP53 losses and mutations but not the prognostic significance.
Train_Line_6530 The association between mutations and cytogenetic risk classification was tested with the use of the chi-square test.
Train_Line_6531 The mean blast percentage of cases with two mutations was 6% compared to 17% for the single mutation group (P < 0.02).
Train_Line_6532 Normalizing to 104 copies of ABL1 in accordance with standardized criteria, transcript levels below 12 to 10 copies appear to predict long-term remission.
Train_Line_6533 Somatic mutations in MPL have not previously been described, though previous genetic and biochemical data suggest that the cytoplasmic-transmembrane junction (which includes W515) is important in its activation.
Train_Line_6534 WHAT DID THE RESEARCHERS DO AND FIND?
Train_Line_6535 No novel coding SNPs were detected in DNMT3A.
Train_Line_6536 Only two patients (3.5%) treated with busulfan alone developed acute leukemia.
Train_Line_6537 OS of DNMT3A-mutated patients with a related donor was not significantly different as compared with patients without a related donor, although 5-year OS was longer in patients with a related donor (5-year OS, 59% v 32%, respectively, P = .2; Fig 3A).
Train_Line_6538 Both reactions were performed in 25-ml volume containing 100 ng of DNA, 0.25 U Taq polymerase, 0.3 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP, 5 ml of a 10X PCR Buffer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), and 0.2 mM each of sense and anti-sense primers.
Train_Line_6539 For inclusion in this study, we applied a cut-off level of 600x109/L.
Train_Line_6540 Furthermore, SOCS3 methylation status did not affect the survival of JAK2 V617F-negative IMF patients or of any subgroup based on Lille prognostic score (data not shown).
Train_Line_6541 In chronic lymphocytic leukemia, SF3B1 was found to be the second most frequently mutated gene.
Train_Line_6542 The major advantage of using flow cytometric detection of MRD lies in its applicability to virtually all patients.
Train_Line_6543 The overall higher incidence in our study is possibly due to the sensitive technique, which detected low level clones (<20% mutant allele burden in 8 patients), the inclusion of patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and also sequencing of the whole gene.
Train_Line_6544 This would suggest that FLT3 mutations in MDS and CMML may not carry the same negative prognostic impact as FLT3 mutations in AML.
Train_Line_6545 Germline loss-of-function mutations in TP53 predispose patients to a multiplicity of cancers, and acquired mutations in p53 occur in approximately 10% of AML samples.
Train_Line_6546 Table 3. Relative contribution of SF3B1 mutation status to the ability of IPSS or WPSS to predict OS in MDS patients.
Train_Line_6547 However, this analysis was hampered by the small number of mutated patients (n = 9).

Train_Line_6549 Figure 2. Mutational analysis of SETD2 in patients with acute leukemia. (a) SETD2 mutations in patients with acute leukemia. The locations of the SET and SRI domains of SETD2 are indicated. The type and position of each identified mutation is shown. HGVS notations corresponding to the abbreviations of the SETD2 mutations used here are listed in Supplementary Table 3. (b) Distinct mutation spectrum of SETD2 in patients with either acute leukemia or ccRCC. Mutational information of SETD2 was obtained from the current study, a previous report by Zhang et al. and the TCGA Research Network. The percentages of SNVs, small insertions or deletions (indels) and large deletions in SETD2 are shown, with the number of each of these variants in parentheses.
Train_Line_6550 Moreover, mutated IDH1 was associated with a high rate of leukemic transformation, and poor event-free and overall survival rates. The rate of IDH1 R132 mutations in MDS patients was lower than the rate in patients with AML arising from MDS or the reported rate in patients with de novo AML.
Train_Line_6551 Second, because U2AF1 mutation occurred more frequently in younger patients, its impact might be more obvious in this subgroup of patients.
Train_Line_6552 Table 1. Details of IDH1 mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_6553 Two patients harbored mutations in both SRSF2 and ZRSR2, one patient had SF3B1 and SRSF2 mutations, and another patient had SF3B1 and ZRSR2 mutations.
Train_Line_6554 Because patients with U2AF1 mutation were younger, they were more likely to be treated with intensive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the time of disease progression.
Train_Line_6555 BCOR mutations were associated with RUNX1 (P = .002) and DNMT3A mutations (P = .015).
Train_Line_6556 By multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model, we demonstrated that WT1 mutation and older age were independent poor prognostic factors, whereas CEBPA double-mutation and NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD- were good prognostic factors in both total cohort and CN-AML patients.
Train_Line_6557 Setd2 knockdown significantly accelerated the development of both Mll-Af9 and MLL-NRIP3 leukemia in the serial transfer recipients, as evidenced by shortened latency and a more severe phenotype of the leukemia (Fig. 5a-c and Supplementary Fig. 13).
Train_Line_6558 Four patients (26.7%) with U2AF1 mutation acquired novel mutations of other genes during follow-ups (Table IV) while 26 patients (20.5%) without U2AF1 mutation did so (data not shown).
Train_Line_6559 Despite the adverse prognostic relevance of ASXL1 mutations in AML patients, the biological function of ASXL1 has been less clearly delineated.
Train_Line_6560 These findings suggest that reduced transcription and abnormal splicing of ABCB7 in patients carrying a somatic mutation of SF3B1 may be at least one of the mechanisms that lead to ring sideroblast formation and RARS phenotype, as represented schematically in Figure 3.
Train_Line_6561 Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome. The model was generated from a stepwise Cox regression model that included age and gene mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, EZH2, IDH1/2 and SRSF2.
Train_Line_6562 Currently, risk evaluation of patients with MDS is based on clinical scoring systems, like the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and the WHO-adapted Prognostic Scoring System.
Train_Line_6563 A total of 2,119 patients with MDS and 466 patients with CMML were evaluated at MD Anderson between 1997 and 2010.
Train_Line_6564 Affymetrix expression data are available from Gene Expression Omnibus under accession GSE29276.
Train_Line_6565 Of these, 44 subjects (10 RA, 22 RCMD, 5 RAEB-1, and 7 RAEB-2) showed a proportion of ring sideroblasts below the diagnostic threshold of 15% for assignment to a sideroblastic subtype (RARS or RCMD-RS), whereas 30 patients had a proportion of ring sideroblasts >= 15% [7 MDS del(5q), 23 RAEB].
Train_Line_6566 Prognostic Significance of ASXL1 Mutations in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes.
Train_Line_6567 VAF in other important genes showed larger (SF3B1, TET2) and smaller (SMC3, NPM1) clone sizes (Figures 2C and 2D) in the corresponding cases.
Train_Line_6568 IDH mutations were closely associated with older age, higher platelet counts, and mutations of DNMT3A (36.4% vs. 8.7%, P < 0.001), ASXL1 (47.6% vs. 22.0%, P = 0.007), and SRSF2 (45.5% vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001).
Train_Line_6569 In order to understand the biological effect of postnatal Asxl1 loss in an established MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm model, we knocked down Asxl1 expression using small-hairpin RNA in vivo in a mouse model of hematopoietic NrasG12D overexpression.
Train_Line_6570 However, after screening our samples for the JAK2V617F mutation and associated 46/1 predisposition genotype, no significant difference was observed between TET2 mutant versus nonmutant patients, showing that the 46/1 genotype was not associated with TET2 mutations in MDS and CMML.
Train_Line_6571 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6572 All samples were obtained on initial diagnosis and chronic phase of MPN.
Train_Line_6573 All but two patients with mutations were transfusion-dependent at the time of sampling.
Train_Line_6574 We studied patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms who were followed at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia, Italy.
Train_Line_6575 CCSP, SP-A and SP-D.81 A conditional mouse model of C/EBPalpha deletion directed to the respiratory epithelium was developed using tissue-specific tetracycline-regulated cre-recombinase-mediated excision of C/EBPalpha (Fig 4).
Train_Line_6576 Figure 3. Revised Risk Stratification of Patients with AML on the Basis of Integrated Genetic Analysis. Panel A shows a revised risk stratification on the basis of integrated cytogenetic and mutational analysis. The final overall risk groups are shown on the right. Panel B shows the effect of integrated mutational analysis on risk stratification in the test cohort of patients with AML (with P values for the comparison of all curves), and Panel C shows the reproducibility of the genetic prognostic schema in an independent cohort of 104 patients from the E1900 trial (with P values for the comparison of all curves). In Panels B and C, the black curves show the patients whose risk classification remained unchanged, the blue curve shows patients who were reclassified from intermediate risk to favorable risk, and the red curve shows patients who were reclassified from intermediate risk to unfavorable risk.
Train_Line_6577 Although we were limited by small number of samples with mutations, the decline in the size of the TP53 mutant clone concurrent with clinical/cytogenetic response to 5-azacitidine can be utilized as a surrogate response marker for early curative therapeutic intervention, such as HSCT.
Train_Line_6578 In addition, expression of MPLW515L in 32D and UT7 cells resulted in hypersensitivity to TPO compared with MPLWT as assessed by cell growth (Figure 2A and 2B) and by Western blotting after TPO stimulation (Figure 2C and 2D).
Train_Line_6579 Recent clinical trials with thalidomide demonstrated modest efficacy in MF, largely by slowing the rate of fibrosis in these patients rather than by reversal of fibrosis.
Train_Line_6580 The median mutant allele burden of patients with two mutations was 65.9% (range 37-81%).
Train_Line_6581 In addition to the potential therapeutic use of EglN inhibition for IDH1/2-mutant disease, small molecule selective inhibitors of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 have recently been developed.

Train_Line_6586 Determining an accurate prognosis is critical for the care and treatment of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_6587 The diagnoses of MDS and leukemic transformation (LT) were according to the World Health Organization criteria.
Train_Line_6588 TABLE I. LNK mutations reported in previous literatures including our cases.
Train_Line_6589 The CALGB compared 2 relatively intense cycles (cytarabine 500 mg/m2 per q12h; mitoxantrone 5 mg/m2 per q12h, each for 6 doses) with 4 less intensive cycles (cytarabine 100 mg/m2 continuous IV on days 1-5) and found no differences.
Train_Line_6590 Retrospective data suggest that treatment outcome might be adversely impacted when the time from diagnosis to start of treatment increases beyond 5 days.
Train_Line_6591 However, within the JAK2 V617F-negative IMF group, there was a trend towards reduced SOCS3 expression in those patients carrying a methylated promoter.
Train_Line_6592 For U2AF35, we amplified two areas with known mutations that included residues S34 and Q157.
Train_Line_6593 Activation of the RAS-MAPK pathway in erythroid progenitors by oncogenic RAS expressed from its endogenous promoter increases cell sensitivity to Epo stimulation, resulting in a mild block in terminal erythroid differentiation, while overexpression of oncogenic RAS in erythroid progenitors leads to constitutive activation of the major signalling pathways, leading to severe block in terminal erythroid differentiation and cytokine-independent proliferation (Zhang & Lodish, 2007).
Train_Line_6594 The mutation was closely associated with male sex; older age; CMML; and mutations of RUNX1, ASXL1, and IDH2, and it was stable during disease evolution.
Train_Line_6595 Subclonal or cooperating driver mutation: A driver mutation that occurs in a cell of an already established clone and generates a subclone carrying both the founding and the newly acquired mutation.
Train_Line_6596 A subsequent overproduction of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate has been proposed to affect the function of alphaKG-dependent enzymes such as TET2, resulting in a decrease of 5hmc.
Train_Line_6597 The minimal overlap of BCOR and NPM1 mutations suggests a contribution of mutated BCOR to AML development through a pathway different from that mediated by mutated NPM1.
Train_Line_6598 For many years, platelet transfusions were given to keep platelet counts above 20 x 109/L.
Train_Line_6599 In particular, we focus on the role of loss-of-function mutations in TET2, gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, and loss-of-function mutations in ASXL1 and mutations of unclear impact in DNMT3A in AML pathogenesis and therapy.
Train_Line_6600 This finding is particularly intriguing since FoxA2 is a critical transcription factor in foregut development and in airway epithelial differentiation and FoxA2 itself is a candidate tumor suppressor in lung cancer.
Train_Line_6601 In several, but not all studies, the presence of NPM1 mutation in CN-AML has been associated with higher CR rates and better RFS and event-free survival (EFS).
Train_Line_6602 The panel included 19 members with recognized clinical and research expertise in AML, of whom 13 came from European Union countries, 5 from the United States, and 1 from Japan.
Train_Line_6603 We compared the overall survival (OS) of 12 patients with DNMT3A mutations vs. 138 patients without a mutation and observed significantly worse OS in patients with mutations (log-rank p=0.005), although our sample size is small and transplantation status was not considered (Figure 2A).
Train_Line_6604 Samples were primarily selected based on availability of sufficient material for genomic profiling and mutational analysis.
Train_Line_6605 All patients included in our study presented with a spectrum of concomitant myeloproliferative and dysplastic features in keeping with a mixed MDS/MPD phenotype.
Train_Line_6606 Patients UPN9 and UPN10 harbor mutations in both genes.
Train_Line_6607 METHODS.
Train_Line_6608 Within patients with MDS/MPN, 16 of 83 (18.3%) carried a somatic mutation in SF3B1, and the proportion of positive patients was significantly higher in RARS-T than in the other WHO categories (66.7% vs 6.2%, P < .001).
Train_Line_6609 The pathogenetic consequences of SOCS3 methylation in idiopathic myelofibrosis remain to be fully elucidated.
Train_Line_6610 The first major breakthrough was the identification of somatic mutations of TET2 in patients with rearrangements of chromosome 4q24, where the gene maps.
Train_Line_6611 These functionally relevant mutations were used as the primary dataset for all subsequent analyses and consisted of 43 nonsense mutations or Indel mutations, 3 splice-site mutations, and 25 nonsynonymous amino acid changes within the protein-conserved domains.
Train_Line_6612 Relief of JMD autoinhibition results in kinase activation by greatly favouring conformations in which the activation loop is shifted away from the active site and the DFG motif adopts a position enabling correct alignment of ATP and catalysis.

The backbone of the two proteins is shown as a coloured ribbon (gold for the autoinhibited and green for the active conformation) with key kinase domains highlighted and labelled. The activation loop (purple) clearly takes up very different positions in the two conformations. All atoms of the residues of the DFG motif at the start of the activation loop have been displayed as purple sticks, with Phe811 labelled, illustrating the orientation enabling correct alignment of ATP and catalysis in the active conformation (right panel). The JMD (yellow) is folded back into the kinase domain in the autoinhibited conformation (left panel) and contacts the rest of the kinase domain, particularly the aC helix (yellow). In the active conformation, the JMD is folded out and is highly flexible, and thus mostly not resolved (right panel). The kinase insert (yellow) is a flexible loop connecting the N and C terminal lobes of KIT and other Type III RTKs. This region is not present in the active conformation crystal structure (right panel). The figure was constructed in Discovery Studio 3.5 (accelrys.com) by superimposition of two crystal structures: PDB 1T45 (autoinhibited KIT) and PDB 1PKG (KIT in complex with ADP as an ATP mimic). Superimposition was performed using 6 tethers (Y609, T619, H650, L656, E671, I805). These tethers have been determined as conformationally invariant using Difference Distance Matrices (DDMs).
Train_Line_6614 Studies suggest that patients with FLT3-ITD have significantly elevated peripheral blood white cell counts and increased bone marrow blasts at diagnosis.
Train_Line_6615 Three out of 53 patients with AML following MDS were found to have mutations in codon R140 of IDH2.
Train_Line_6616 The study also identified older age, anemia and absence of JAK2V617F as risk factors for fibrotic progression and history of thrombosis and extreme thrombocytosis as risk factors for leukemic transformation.
Train_Line_6617 Molecular tools are increasingly being used in the diagnosis and prognostic definition of both myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms.
Train_Line_6618 Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are also important negative regulators of JAK signaling through a classic feedback loop.
Train_Line_6619 Signalling by WT KIT.
Train_Line_6620 No IDH2 R140 or R172 mutations were identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_6621 Myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome are now listed as distinct entities.
Train_Line_6622 In summary, we identified germline mutations in DDX41 that are associated with the development of hereditary MDS and AML.
Train_Line_6623 Various genetic pathways and cooperating mutations are involved in its pathogenesis.
Train_Line_6624 Verification of WES findings by direct Sanger sequencing in the AML index patient.
Train_Line_6625 In the same model, CBF status also predicted a lower CIR (Table 2 and Fig 2A).
Train_Line_6626 A recent study suggests that survival is also poorer in patients with therapy-related CBF AML compared with de novo CBF AML
Train_Line_6627 In testicular seminomas frequencies of up to 26% have been reported.
Train_Line_6628 The SF3B1 protein is a core component of the U2 snRNP, which binds to the branch site, thereby base-pairing with the intron RNA.
Train_Line_6629 Expression analysis of knockout versus wild-type lungs demonstrated that the expression of genes characteristic of differentiated pulmonary cells (AQ5, SPA, ABCA3) were downregulated, and genes associated with proliferation (Rgs2, G0s2), tumor progression (Tiam1, Pcsk6) and cell survival (TGFbeta2, Gli1) were upregulated in CEBPalpha-deficient cells.

Non-CpG cytosine residues are shown in red (converted to 'T' in bisulphite-modified DNA) whilst CpG cytosine residues are shown in blue (remaining as 'C' in bisulphite-modified methylated CpG dinucleotides). Patient MF4 showed complete methylation of all CpG dinucleotides examined. (D) Real time PCR detection of SOCS3 promoter CpG island methylation. MF10-MF13, myelofibrosis. Control samples containing methylated DNA at known concentrations (100%, 50%, 25%, 1% and 0% methylated) are indicated. The results for mononuclear cells are shown for patients MF10 and MF13 while the results using granulocyte DNA are shown for patients MF11 and MF12.
Train_Line_6631 Dynamics of ASXL1 mutation and other associated genetic alterations during disease progression in patients with primary myelodysplastic syndrome.
Train_Line_6632 This finding suggests that the presence of specific mutated alleles of PTPN11 may identify the subgroup of individuals with Noonan syndrome who are at risk for JMML.
Train_Line_6633 The follow-up information was updated by means of clinic visits as well as by means of telephone calls to patients, their doctors, or local registry offices.
Train_Line_6634 Interestingly, the shorter p30 isoform lacks E2F-repression and thus lacks antimitotic activity in adipogenic and granulocytic cell types.
Train_Line_6635 These variants were also not present in dbSNP132 or the 1000 Genomes Project database (July 2011; see URLs).
Train_Line_6636 Importantly, this autoinhibitory mechanism also interferes with imatinib binding.
Train_Line_6637 The mean threshold cycle (Ct) was calculated for each transcript and the SOCS1 and SOCS3 transcript levels relative to ABL were calculated using the equation 2---Delta--Ct(SOCS-ABL).
Train_Line_6638 Analysis of mutations in genes of the splicing machinery.
Train_Line_6639 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by cytopenia, morphologic dysplasia, cytogenetic abnormalities, and propensity to progress to secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML).
Train_Line_6640 However, it is to be noted that the recommended platelet target is not based on controlled evidence.
Train_Line_6641 Acquired mutations within the MPL gene have been detected in up to 8% of IMF patients and in up to 4% of ET patients but not in PV patients.
Train_Line_6642 OS was measured from the date of first diagnosis to death from any cause, and relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the time of CR until relapse, death, or end of study.
Train_Line_6643 Along these lines, residue F595, located in the helix C of the pseudokinase domain, was shown to be required for both V617F and K539L mutants but not for cytokine-induced JAK2 activation.
Train_Line_6644 We then evaluated OS and LFS in the subgroup of patients with RARS and RCMD-RS specifically.
Train_Line_6645 The findings regarding correlations of U2AF1 mutation with clinical features and the impact of this mutation on survival in MDS patients vary in different studies and remain inconclusive.
Train_Line_6646 Among the 185 patients included in the current analysis, there was no significant difference in cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) between the 400-mg and 3-g cytarabine arms, whereas patients on the 100-mg arm had significantly higher CIR as compared with that of the patients on the 400-mg arm or those on the 3-g arm.
Train_Line_6647 Secondly, SOCS3 expression is induced by a number of cytokines including interleukin-3, thrombopoietin, erythropoietin and GM-CSF, growth factors to which hematopoietic progenitors from MPD patients show hypersensitivity.
Train_Line_6648 Uniparental disomy (UPD) refers to large regions of acquired homozygosity resulting from mitotic recombination allowing malignant cells to multiply gene mutations and to dispose of wild-type alleles obtaining a selective growth advantage over cells without UPD.
Train_Line_6649 This effect was also evident when considering patients with low-risk MDS (IPSS low and intermediate-1) alone, suggesting that SRSF2 mutations might be a molecular marker useful for risk stratification in the subgroup of lower-risk MDS patients.
Train_Line_6650 There is no general consensus when to begin with the transfusion of irradiated blood products.
Train_Line_6651 The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the distribution of OS and time to AML progression and to compare differences between survival curves, respectively.
Train_Line_6652 Collectively, these mutations were observed in up to 85% of different myeloid neoplasms with myelodysplastic features, thus suggesting an important contribution of genetic alterations involving splicing components to the pathophysiology of MDS.
Train_Line_6653 Frequency and prognostic impact of mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_6654 The methylation status of the CpG islands within the promoter and exon 2 of SOCS1 and within the promoter of SOCS3 were investigated.
Train_Line_6655 We have recently shown the utility of NGS technology for the detection of novel mutations across the TET2 gene, with a mutant-allele detection sensitivity of 1%-2% in total bone marrow DNA.
Train_Line_6656 The reaction was denatured at 94--Degree--C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturing at 94--Degree--C for 30s, annealing at 57--Degree--C for 30 s, and extension at 72--Degree--C for 40s.
Train_Line_6657 Good, normal karyotype, isolated-Y, del (5q) or del (20q); Poor, complex (>=3 abnormalities) or chromosome 7 anomalies; Intermediate, other abnormalities.
Train_Line_6658 Clinically, C/EBPalpha mutations are associated with lower leukocyte counts and lactate dehydrogenase levels and with aberrant expression of T-cell surface markers such as CD7 at presentation.
Train_Line_6659 We studied 564 patients with MDS, 88 with MDS/MPN, and 40 with AML evolving from MDS (Table 1).
Train_Line_6660 Known SNPs and novel polymorphisms that were identified in more than 2 patients and confirmed in paired constitutional DNA, were excluded from the analysis.
Train_Line_6661 The identification of mutations in 2% of patients with normal cytogenetics, indicates a different biological (as yet unidentified) role for TP53 protein in 'low risk' MDS including 5q- syndrome that possibly triggers disease progression.
Train_Line_6662 BACKGROUND.
Train_Line_6663 The former subset usually predicts treatment-related mortality (TRM) and becomes more important as patient age increases while the latter predicts resistance to, at least, conventional therapy.
Train_Line_6664 The occurrence in an immature hematopoietic stem cell of a somatic mutation that provides survival and growth advantage (for instance, lower propensity to apoptosis) leads to formation of a local clone (Figure 2, step 1).
Train_Line_6665 The discrete variables of patients with and without gene mutation were compared using the X2 tests; but if the expected values of contingency tables were smaller than 5, Fisher exact test was used.
Train_Line_6666 An expression clone (pCMV6-XL6-GATA2) containing a 3.7-kb GATA2 cDNA insert was obtained from OriGene (Cat. No. SC125368). p.Thr354Met, p.Thr355del and p.Leu359Val mutants were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) using the primers T354M-F and T354M-R, 355delT-F and 355delT-R, and L359V-F and L359V-R (Supplementary Table 11), respectively.
Train_Line_6667 Table 6. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) on the RFS and OS Variable.
Train_Line_6668 Genotyping was performed on DNA using the Affymetrix 250K or SNP6 platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as described previously (Smith et al 2010).
Train_Line_6669 Figure 1. KIT structure and mutations in cancer. The schematic diagram shows KIT protein domains and the corresponding gene exons as well as representative mutations that have been reported in SM, AML and GIST. For a more complete list of KIT mutations in disease, see [47]. The figure is reproduced from [99] with the publisher's permission.
Train_Line_6670 Among 26 mutations on exon 7, 23 (88.5%) were frame-shift mutations, compared with one of the 3 exon 9 mutations (P = .068).
Train_Line_6671 NPM1/FLT3 high-risk patients with mutated DNMT3A had a significantly shorter OS and RFS (median OS in mutated v wild-type patients 0.85 v 4.41 years, HR = 2.58, 95% CI, 1.67 to 3.96, P < .001; RFS, HR = 2.02, 95% CI, 1.18 to 3.43, P = .01) and a lower CR rate (59% v 78%, P = .015) compared with patients with wild-type DNMT3A (Figs 2C and 2D).
Train_Line_6672 Pharmacological reactivation of PP2A with FTY720 (a nontoxic drug recently FDA-approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis because of its immunosuppressive action) reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis of murine early myeloid cells expressing D816V KIT in vitro and retarded their growth in syngeneic mice.
Train_Line_6673 No survival differences were found between the patients with and without SRSF2 mutation in the higher risk groups (Figure 1C,E,G).
Train_Line_6674 AMLs are now categorized as "AML with myelodysplasia-related changes" if (1) they have a previous history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) and evolve to AML with a marrow or blood blast count of 20% or more; (2) they have a myelodysplasia-related cytogenetic abnormality (listed in a footnote to Table 1); or (3) if 50% or more of cells in 2 or more myeloid lineages are dysplastic.
Train_Line_6675 Mutation analysis.
Train_Line_6676 Such aberrations include unbalanced translocations with chromosomal material of unknown origin, marker or ring chromosomes, homogeneously staining regions, or double minutes, the latter representing cytogenetic equivalents of high-level DNA amplifications.
Train_Line_6677 These observations have striking implications for the application of imatinib in GIST and SM in particular.
Train_Line_6678 Figure 3 (facing page). Association of CALR Mutations with Uniparental Disomies and Clonal Hierarchies in Patients with Multiple Somatic Mutations. Panel A shows results from the polymerase-chain-reaction product-sizing analysis of CALR exon 9 in three patients with a 5-bp insertion. In the three patients, the mutated allele peak is higher than the nonmutated allele peak, indicating the presence of cells homozygous for the mutation. The plots on the right show data from Genome- Wide human single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, version 6.0 (Affymetrix). Each dot represents a single SNP. The x axis shows the genomic position, and the y axis the allelic status of the SNP (an allelic difference of 0 indicates heterozygous status) according to fluorescence intensity. The array data show that the three samples have clones with uniparental disomy of chromosome 19p of different sizes, which corresponds to the differences in peak heights observed in the fragment analysis of CALR. Taken together, the results indicate that homozygosity of mutated CALR is derived from duplication of a heterozygous mutation as a result of acquisition of a uniparental disomy in the three patients. Blue boxes indicate the genomic region of the uniparental disomies. Panel B shows the clonal hierarchies derived from the analysis of hematopoietic progenitor colonies. Patient H_0191 had somatic mutations in four genes. As shown in the bar chart, 51% of the colonies had mutations in CALR, GAB2, and METTL11B. The other colonies (48%) had mutations in all four genes, indicating that the mutation in the gene encoding plant homeo domain finger protein 16 (PHF16) was acquired later and gave rise to a subclone. In addition, one colony (1%) had a 1-bp deletion in CALR, in contrast to the 52-bp deletion observed in the granulocyte sample and in all other colonies from this patient. Because this colony had none of the other mutations observed in the patient, it represents an independent clone, although this conclusion is based only on a single colony. Patient H_0296 had somatic mutations in CALR, PIK3R, and C10orf71. All colonies analyzed from this patient had all three mutations. One colony showed an 18-bp deletion in CALR in addition to the 1-bp deletion observed in this patient. The two mutations were on the same allele. Mutated CALR was found in an early clone in both patients; the roles of the other mutated genes are unclear. The plots on the right side schematically depict the clonal history that gave rise to the clonal composition observed at the time of the sample. Different colors indicate the different clones, as shown in the bar charts. CFU denotes colony-forming units, and del deletion.
Train_Line_6679 Several mutations have been described to occur in MDS, including mutations in TET2, ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, TP53, NRAS, KRAS, CBL, ETV6, IDH1, and IDH2, with the recent addition of DNMT3A.
Train_Line_6680 Our understanding of the genetics of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has advanced significantly in recent years and the biology of CLL is currently used to choose treatment.
Train_Line_6681 JAK2V617F is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that activates downstream signal transduction pathways and transforms hematopoietic cells to cytokine-independent growth, and these cells are sensitive to a small molecule JAK Inhibitor.
Train_Line_6682 Although we have only been able to detect single allele GATA2 germline mutations in affected samples, we cannot rule out the possibility of acquired mutations in the 'normal' allele.
Train_Line_6683 Recently, next-generation sequencing studies of CN-AML led to the identification of new mutations in the IDH1, IDH2, and DNMT3A genes.
Train_Line_6684 Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 (Janus kinase 2; 9p24) mutation; approximately 96% and 3% displaying somatic activating mutations in exon 14 (JAK2V617F) and exon 12 of JAK2, respectively.
Train_Line_6685 PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of select exons of MPL, EPOR, and GCSFR was performed using M13-tailed primers as previously described, and specific primer sequences are listed in Table S1.
Train_Line_6686 Patients alive without relapse were censored, whereas those who died without relapse were counted as a competing cause of failure.

Train_Line_6688 Statistical Analysis.
Train_Line_6689 Immunoprecipitation.
Train_Line_6690 In an animal model of conditional Tet2 loss, Tet2 haploinsufficiency was shown to lead to a disorder resembling human CMML.
Train_Line_6691 We hypothesized that JAK2V617F-negative patients with MPD might have mutations involving other components of the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway that include cytokine receptors, other JAK family members, or STAT family members.
Train_Line_6692 Characteristics of BCOR mutations in AML.
Train_Line_6693 Additional studies are needed to dissect the functional relevance of CALR mutations.
Train_Line_6694 In contrast, colony-forming cell assays showed that knockdown of Setd2 did not have a significant effect on wild-type HSPCs (Supplementary Fig. 14), suggesting an insufficient effect of Setd2 alteration alone on normal hematopoietic cell growth.
Train_Line_6695 In a feasibility study in younger adults, the addition of GO to standard induction therapy led to a promising 91% CR rate.
Train_Line_6696 Cells were collected and lysed in lysis buffer and separated by electrophoresis as described previously.
Train_Line_6697 The frequency of CK+/molMK+ AML was much lower (75 of 234; 32%) because many monosomies described in chromosome banding analysis were not real monosomies but part of chromosomal material hidden in unbalanced translocation or marker chromosomes.
Train_Line_6698 HEK293, 293T and Cos-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS (JRH Biosciences), and transient transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Train_Line_6699 A strong association between the presence of RSs and SF3B1 mutation was observed: 31 of 41 patients with RS harbored a mutation in SF3B1 (84% vs 5%; P < .001).
Train_Line_6700 Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier survival curves. OS (A) and RFS (B) in 121 CN-AML patients based on scoring system (P < .001 for both OS and RFS). CN-AMLpatients were grouped according to scoring system based on 4 prognostic markers (CEBPA double-mutation, NPM1/FLT3-ITD, WT1 mutation, and age).Ascore of -1 was assigned for each parameter associated with a favorable outcome (CEBPA double-mutation and NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD-) and a score of 1 for each factor associated with an adverse outcome (WT1 mutation and older age). The algebraic summation of these scores of each patient was the final score.
Train_Line_6701 Gene expression profiling of patients with ASXL1 wild type and mutation suggested an upregulation of the immune response pathway in patients with gene mutation.
Train_Line_6702 MDSs are heterogeneous disorders ranging from indolent conditions with a near-normal life expectancy to subtypes very close to AML.
Train_Line_6703 SUMMARY.
Train_Line_6704 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_6705 Table 2. Final Multivariable Model for Cumulative Incidence of Relapse.
Train_Line_6706 This study involves a relatively large number of patients with WHO-defined CMML and its objective was to evaluate the prevalence, clinical correlates, and prognostic relevance of SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF35 mutations.
Train_Line_6707 Presence of double mutations were associated with tMDS and a low blast count, but no statistically significant difference in OS or PFS was seen compared with cases showing a single mutation.
Train_Line_6708 A recent study of 476 cases with intermediate-risk de novo AML showed that ASXL1 mutations have a major impact on outcome.
Train_Line_6709 Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate.
Train_Line_6710 The average variant allelic frequency of BRCC3 mutations was 30.1%, and by a serial sample analysis at two different time points a BRCC3 mutation was already identified in the initial stage of a myelodysplastic syndrome.
Train_Line_6711 So were the incidences of ASXL1 mutation among patients with higher-risk MDS (RAEB by the 2008 WHO classification) and those with lower-risk MDS (other subtypes with bone marrow blasts less than 5; 25.5 vs 18.9-31% and 10.5% vs 8.7-14.2%).
Train_Line_6712 JAK2V617F mutation.
Train_Line_6713 JAK2 is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that is crucial for effective signaling through type I cytokine receptors including receptors for erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating-factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating-factor (G-CSF).
Train_Line_6714 Additionally, a strong association between IDH1 mutations with intermediate risk karyotype and concurrent NPM1 mutations was found.
Train_Line_6715 Notably, there were no cases of LT amongst the patients with JAK2 or MPL mutations.
Train_Line_6716 At a median follow-up of 15 months, considering all 226 patients, 176 (78%) deaths, and 32 (14%) leukemic transformations were documented.
Train_Line_6717 Among the 354 MDS patients, a total of 15 patients displayed 15 BCOR alterations (4.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6-6.9) and 3 patients were mutated for BCORL1 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5) (Table 3).
Train_Line_6718 Founding or initiating clone: A malignant clone generated by a founding somatic mutation.
Train_Line_6719 Familial in GIST.
Train_Line_6720 To assess the frequency of very low-abundance disease clones, we resequenced the first 96 patients at much greater depth (450X vs 130X).
Train_Line_6721 Controlled studies have confirmed the anti-thrombotic value of low-dose aspirin in PV, among all risk categories.
Train_Line_6722 A study using a K641E knock-in mouse model system indicated that normal ICC progenitors express low levels of c-Kit.
Train_Line_6723 Selective JAK2 inhibitors (SAR302503 and BMS911543), combination JAK2/JAK3 inhibitor (CEP701), and combination JAK2/TYK2 inhibitor (pacritinib) have shown clinical efficacy in phase I/II trials.
Train_Line_6724 The DDX41 protein is highly conserved among species.
Train_Line_6725 In the low-risk disease setting, management had to start with simple nondrug measures, such as avoidance of precipitating conditions, dry skin, and temperature control of one's environment and water used for bathing.
Train_Line_6726 Real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR assays have been developed for other fusion gene targets such as MLLT3-MLL and DEK-NUP214, but data are very scarce due to the low frequencies of these leukemias.
Train_Line_6727 The paraffin was removed in Roti-clear (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany; three times for 10 min at 58--Degree--C).
Train_Line_6728 Cox models were constructed to adjust for clinical and transplantation characteristics, and a backward elimination selection algorithm was used, with candidate variables having a univariable P value < .20.
Train_Line_6729 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis.
Train_Line_6730 Recently, this approach identified recurrent mutations of IDH1 and DNMT3A in a significant proportion of CN-AML patients.
Train_Line_6731 Results.
Train_Line_6732 Attempts to increase response rates by the use of additional cytotoxic agents (thioguanine, etoposide, fludarabine, topotecan), or modulators of multidrug resistance (MDR) in general have failed.
Train_Line_6733 Deletions of the long arm of chr.5 involving the DDX41 locus (5q35.3) were present in 6% of all cases and 26% of the del(5q) cases (Figure 2A; Figure S3A) and resulted in decreased DDX41 mRNA levels (p = 0.0004; Figure 2B).
Train_Line_6734 In the earlier study, 809 high-risk patients were given low-dose aspirin plus either anagrelide or hydroxyurea.
Train_Line_6735 Clinical and hematologic features of patients with SF3B1 mutation were compared with those of patients without mutation in a subgroup of 325 subjects whose data at the time of molecular evaluation were available.
Train_Line_6736 The same significant result was obtained when the Italian and German patients were analyzed separately (Table 3 blocks A1 and A2, respectively).
Train_Line_6737 The missense mutations involve highly conserved residues within the methyltransferase domain of DNMT3A, suggesting that they may not be simple loss of function mutations but may confer a novel protein function.
Train_Line_6738 Nonetheless, there are subsets of CBF AML that do rather poorly (eg, t(8;21) with high WBCs, CBF AML with KIT mutations or molecular disease persistence); allogeneic HSCT may be considered in these patients, especially for those with a low transplant risk (eg, European Bone Marrow Transplant [EBMT] risk 0-1, CMV-negative serostatus, no comorbidity), although such a strategy should be investigated within a clinical trial.
Train_Line_6739 Previous reports have suggested that TET2 mutations may precede the JAK2V617F mutation in MPN.
Train_Line_6740 If an allogeneic HSCT is not possible (eg, due to lack of a suitable donor), an autologous HSCT is often regarded as the second best option.
Train_Line_6741 For SRSF2, we applied a nested PCR specific for the area around mutational hotspot residue P95 in exon 1.
Train_Line_6742 We determined the genomic DNA sequence of all RefSeq exons in 50 candidate genes (Supplementary Table 1) from affected individuals representing five pedigrees with predisposition to MDS-AML who were prescreened for an absence of RUNX1 or CEBPA germline mutations.
Train_Line_6743 We next examined the effect of SH2B3 mutants on downstream signalling of JAK2.
Train_Line_6744 We applied the LR-PSS to a well-annotated cohort of 288 patients with low- or intermediate-1 IPSS risk MDS, and clinical characteristics representative of patients with lower-risk MDS were described in epidemiologic studies (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_6745 In this study, we show that GATA2 is a new predisposition gene for familial MDS-AML and show functional changes caused by mutations within a highly conserved threonine repeat located in ZF2.
Train_Line_6746 KIT was first identified as a retroviral oncogene, as the product of the "white spotting" (W) locus in mice, and at the protein level, as a marker of human acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and normal haemopoietic progenitor cells (reviewed [1]).
Train_Line_6747 In two similar diseases, polycythemia vera (in which the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells) and essential thrombocytosis (in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets), and in some patients with MF, scientists have found genetic changes which seem to trigger these diseases.
Train_Line_6748 Asxl1 attenuation resulted in significant perinatal lethality, although surviving mice had defects in B lymphopoiesis and developmental defects.
Train_Line_6749 Regarding the p.R551W and p.I568T in C-terminal region, actually we cannot expect the functional consequences because those are not located in the main domain.
Train_Line_6750 Both TET2 and DNMT3A mutations are relatively promiscuous and often co-occur with other mutated genes that can predict outcomes.
Train_Line_6751 Drugs that bind to the active conformation, such as dasatinib and PKC412 are, in general, broad spectrum kinase inhibitors with correspondingly greater toxicity.
Train_Line_6752 Figure 6. MPLW515L Increases the Number of Megakaryocyte and Myeloid Colonies in Spleen, without Affecting Megakaryocyte Ploidy, and Causes Cytokine-Independent Myeloid Colony Growth. (A) Megakaryocyte colony-forming assay in the presence of TPO, IL3, IL11, and IL6 demonstrates similar numbers of megakaryocyte colonies obtained from MPLW515L-expressing bone marrow and an increase in the number of megakaryocyte colonies from spleen cells compared with MPLWT. (B) Acetylcholinesterase staining of megakaryocyte colonies derived from bone marrow demonstrates much larger colony size in MPLW515L as compared with MPLWT megakaryocyte colonies. (C) Megakaryocyte ploidy analysis shows the same distribution for MPLW515L-expressing cells and MPLWT-expressing cells.

There is no difference in colony distribution between MPLWT- and MPLW515L-expressing cells. Colony counts reflect only positively identifiable colonies, with thorough megakaryocyte colony analysis done in MegaCult assay (Figure 6A), and thus are excluded from methylcellulose colony analysis.

Train_Line_6753 Even where effective inhibition of KIT is achieved in GIST, disease eradication does not occur.
Train_Line_6754 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6755 The IDH mutations were detected in 22 patients (4.6%), including 19 (4.0%) with IDH2 mutation and 3 (0.6%) with IDH1 mutation (Table I).
Train_Line_6756 In addition, mutations in the zinc finger IKZF1, known to be prevalent in blast phase CML and Ph+ ALL, have been identified in 19% of blast phase MPN whereas they are almost never observed in chronic phase MPN.
Train_Line_6757 In this study, patients with WT1 mutations were much younger than those without the mutation (38.5 years vs 53 years), a result similar to the reports of Renneville et al and Gaidzik et al, but not others.
Train_Line_6758 A total of 40 mutations were detected in 30 patients, 10 of whom had two mutant clones.
Train_Line_6759 Also, in both PV and ET, some patients may develop acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS), especially in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelets >1,000 x 109/L), and be at risk for aspirin-associated bleeding.
Train_Line_6760 Other frameshift mutations were less frequent (Table 2).
Train_Line_6761 Interestingly, a genome-wide association study (Gudbjartsson et al 2009) found that a known non-synonymous germline polymorphism in the SH2B3 PH domain (rs3184504, SH2B3 W262R) was associated with increased haemoglobin, white blood cell and platelet counts.
Train_Line_6762 Among patients with essential thrombocythemia, those with a CALR mutation had a lower hemoglobin level, lower white-cell count, and higher platelet count at diagnosis than patients with mutated JAK2 (P<0.001 for all comparisons).
Train_Line_6763 Within the group of patients with complex cytogenetics, TP53 mutations highlighted a subset with significantly shorter OS.
Train_Line_6764 Within MDS/MPN, a remarkable difference in the incidence of SF3B1 mutations was found between CMML and RARS-T (Table 1).
Train_Line_6765 Because we only found mutations between exons 15 to 23, we subsequently sequenced exons 15 to 23 of DNMT3A in our AML cohort using primers as described (Data Supplement Table S1).
Train_Line_6766 Because we also applied array-based techniques, we identified additional CNAs associated with TP53-altered CK-AML, that is, -3/3p-, -16/16q-, -18/18q-, -20/20q-, and gains or amplifications of 1p, 11q, 13q, and 19p.
Train_Line_6767 Missense mutations affecting conserved amino acids have been shown also to impair the catalytic activity of the protein.
Train_Line_6768 Further analyses on individual and combined cohorts are available online (supplemental Table 14).
Train_Line_6769 Because 6 patients were excluded owing to inadequate followup, a total of 1102 patients were examined.
Train_Line_6770 Finally, several germ-line mutations in GATA2 have been reported to be associated with the autosomal dominant and sporadic monocytopenia and mycobacterial infection (MonoMAC) syndrome, which predisposes to myeloid malignancy.
Train_Line_6771 The LR-PSS successfully stratified patients with lower-risk MDS into three risk categories with significant differences in overall survival (20% in category 1 with median of 5.19 years [95% CI, 3.01 to 10.34 years], 56% in category 2 with median of 2.65 years [95% CI, 2.18 to 3.30 years], and 25% in category 3 with median of 1.11 years [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.51 years]), thus validating this prognostic model.
Train_Line_6772 The C-terminus part contains a proline-rich domain involved in the binding of several SH3 proteins.
Train_Line_6773 RCMD-RS was a separate MDS category in the 2001 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms but was incorporated into RCMD in the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_6774 While testing for NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 is currently not considered mandatory outside clinical trials, the panel recommends that these 3 mutations be analyzed at least in patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) who will receive treatment other than low-dose chemotherapy or best supportive care.
Train_Line_6775 For BRCC3 located on chromosome X, expression was assessed by comparison to sex-matched controls.
Train_Line_6776 Abnormal karyotypes may be diagnosed from blood specimens.
Train_Line_6777 In these mice, in utero loss of C/EBPalpha leads to respiratory arrest and death soon after birth due to a differentiation arrest of type II alveolar cells associated with proliferation of immature type II alveolar cells, causing epithelial cell expansion and loss of airspace.
Train_Line_6778 Ten MF patients had myelofibrosis secondary to another MPD (5 PV, 5 ET) and two MF patients showed coexisting myelodysplastic features.
Train_Line_6779 Imatinib has profoundly improved the outlook for GIST patients, but the question remains as to whether this cancer can ever be eradicated with kinase inhibitors alone.
Train_Line_6780 The base line reference for copy number data was derived from a cohort of 91 normal controls consisting of cases from Kings College London, as well as external publicly available data (Mailman et al 2007; Jasek et al 2010).
Train_Line_6781 While analyses of genomic copy number will continue to be informative with regard to selection of candidate leukemia genes, it is also hoped that high-throughput DNA sequence analysis will become possible at an affordable cost, which may ultimately result in the development of comprehensive, disease- and allele-specific oncogene mutation profiling strategies.
Train_Line_6782 Identifying the patients with a more aggressive disease in lower-risk group is especially important because these patients may benefit from early therapeutic intervention or participating in clinical trials.
Train_Line_6783 Of them, 2 of the 3 base substitutions caused amino acid changes, the remaining one base substitution and 2 insertion mutations (patient nos. 11 and 30) created a stop codon, and the others resulted in reading frame shift, which was predicted to generate nonfunctional truncated proteins with loss of their DNA-binding sites (aa391-aa506), RNA recognition sites (zinc finger 1), and nuclear localization signal (aa359-aa418).
Train_Line_6784 Genetic aberrations are common in CMML and tend to involve different cellular targets and epigenetic regulatory pathways.
Train_Line_6785 This likely reflects the mutation strongly favouring the active conformation of the KIT kinase domain to which, as in the case of BCR/ABL, imatinib cannot bind.
Train_Line_6786 A Cochrane review compared antibiotic prophylaxis with placebo or no intervention in afebrile neutropenic patients.
Train_Line_6787 Direct contact with the basal transcriptional apparatus (TBP/TFIIB), interaction with histone acetyltransferases (CBP/p300), and recruitment of chromatin-remodelling complexes (SWI/SNF) have all been implicated in the activation of lineage-specific genes by C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_6788 Table 1. Comparison of clinical and molecular characteristics of 193 MDS patients according to SRSF2 mutation status.
Train_Line_6789 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first CR was performed in 30 CK-AML patients.
Train_Line_6790 By contrast, a study of a large cohort of 605 AML cases without cytogenetic prognostic markers other than 11q23 abnormalities, reported that ASXL1 mutations were not associated with outcome.
Train_Line_6791 We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin.
Train_Line_6792 The value of allogeneic HSCT needs to be reassessed based on the identification of AML-related genetic changes that profoundly impact on prognosis, on the availability of different transplant sources (bone marrow, blood) and donor types (matched related, unrelated and haploidentical donors, umbilical cord stem cell grafts), and in light of the use of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens.
Train_Line_6793 Patients with more than 1 mutation are denoted as n/n RMA.
Train_Line_6794 More recently several such mutations have been identified in MPNs, having a marked presence, as well, in MDS/MPN overlap syndromes.
Train_Line_6795 Global DNA methylation is shown as percentage methylation of a methylated control DNA, which was provided by the manufacturer.
Train_Line_6796 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6797 We used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare hematologic values in patients carrying different mutated genes.
Train_Line_6798 None of the patients with wild type TP53 (n = 67) had a strong TP53 expression.
Train_Line_6799 Consistent with the histopathologic findings, flow cytometry analysis of MPLW515L bone marrow cells demonstrated an ~4-fold increase in Mac1+/Gr1+ mature myeloid cells as compared with bone marrow cells from MPLWT animals (Figure 5A, upper panels).
Train_Line_6800 The p.Q423X is a nonsence mutation located on exon 7 encoding the Src homology 2 domain.
Train_Line_6801 The BM was massively infiltrated by myeloid blasts (83%) that were positive for myeloperoxidase (30%) and negative for nonspecific esterase.
Train_Line_6802 In contrast, the risk of thrombosis, in both PV and ET, exceeds 20% and a substantial proportion of patients experience vasomotor disturbances (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, acral paresthesias, erythromelalgia, atypical chest pain), and in case of PV, pruritus.
Train_Line_6803 These symptoms are believed to stem from small vessel-based abnormal platelet-endothelial interactions.
Train_Line_6804 Figure 2. Schematic representation of the concept of cotranscriptional RNA splicing and potential outcomes of mutations of genes encoding proteins of the spliceosome. Top: Although transcription of nucleosome-free DNA into pre-mRNA by RNA polymerase II and pre-mRNA splicing are traditionally considered as separate and sequential processes, increasing evidence suggests that transcription and RNA processing are strictly coupled in vivo and that several splicing factors also play a role in the regulation of transcription. According to Han et al, cotranscriptional splicing represent a general rule with exceptions. Bottom: Potential outcomes of mutations of genes encoding proteins of the spliceosome. These outcomes include reduced (or also increased) transcription, exon skipping, intron retention, and cryptic exonic (or intronic) splice site activation with truncated (or elongated) exon. Adapted from Ebert and Bernard.
Train_Line_6805 Among them, the disease of 362 patients fulfilled the criteria of MDS according to the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_6806 These disorders show impressive clinical heterogeneity, ranging from conditions with a near-normal standardized mortality ratio to entities that are very close to AML.
Train_Line_6807 An emerging hypothesis posits that mutations in signaling molecules are not sufficient for disease development in humans and that several cooperating genetic hits might be required to induce disease and allow progression (Table 1, Figure 2).
Train_Line_6808 These results were confirmed by reexamining the paired samples with GeneScan, a technique capable of detecting mutant DNA down to 5% of total DNA.
Train_Line_6809 The ability to recognize patients from this IPSS-defined lower-risk subset with a worse prognosis than expected could have important implications for the selection of risk-appropriate therapy while improving prognostic accuracy and informing MDS biology.
Train_Line_6810 Similar results were also observed in a subset analysis of patients who had a normal karyotype.
Train_Line_6811 Confluent islets of immature erythroblasts were easily detected by antihemoglobin immunolabeling of marrow sections (Figure 1C).
Train_Line_6812 Subgroup analyses showed that the impact of IDH mutations on OS was only seen in the patients with lower-risk MDS, that is low and intermediate-1 (int-1) risk by IPSS (median, 12.4 months vs. 69.9 months, P < 0.001, Fig. 1C), or RA and RARS by FAB classification (median, 12.4 months vs. 87.4 months, P = 0.001, Fig. 1E), or very low and low risk by IPSS-R (median, 26.3 months vs. 102.8 months, P < 0.001, Fig. 1F).
Train_Line_6813 Similarly, in CBF AML mutant KIT requires the co-expression of transcription factor fusion proteins that promote survival and block differentiation.
Train_Line_6814 However, other lines of evidence indicate that JAK2V617F mutation may not be the initial event in certain MPNs and that other genetic events may be required for disease development.
Train_Line_6815 All candidate mutations were subsequently analyzed in an independent experiment using nonamplified genomic DNA.
Train_Line_6816 TABLE I. Comparison of Clinical Manifestations and Laboratory Features Between MDS Patients with and without IDH Mutations.
Train_Line_6817 Similarly a c-CBL mutation has been detected in blasts from a JAK2V617F-positive MPN, which became JAK2V617F negative during transformation.
Train_Line_6818 Gene-therapy utilizing novel vector systems, such as lentiviral vectors or fusion peptides, such as VP22 or TAT to facilitate entry into the cells are potential considerations.
Train_Line_6819 Morphological features of bone marrow smears and trephines.
Train_Line_6820 However, the reproducibility of these latter parameters is far from optimal, and there is a need for more robust prognostic factors.
Train_Line_6821 There is considerable therapeutic potential for epigenetic-targeted therapies in AML, and this may be also true in MDS.
Train_Line_6822 Interestingly, during disease progression, ASXL1-mutated patients frequently acquired other novel genetic alterations, most commonly RUNX1 and NRAS mutations, (Table 3) or had chromosomal evolution indicating the additional genetic aberrations contributed to the progression of MDS in these patients.
Train_Line_6823 These interventions are not an option in patients who already have active graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
Train_Line_6824 This hypothesis was determined by 4 lines of evidence:
Train_Line_6825 Heterozygous missense mutations in IDH1 at position R132 and in IDH2 at positions R140 and R172 have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_6826 The function of ASXL1 in hematopoiesis is still poorly understood.
Train_Line_6827 U2AF1 (synonym U2AF35), another splicing machinery gene frequently mutated in MDS, belongs to the splicing factor SR family genes and encodes the small subunit of U2 auxiliary factor complex required for the binding of U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA branch site.
Train_Line_6828 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_6829 Risk-adapted therapy: Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV.
Train_Line_6830 4.3 Cytogenetics.
Train_Line_6831 Because DNMT3A interacts with EZH2 and is mutated in AML and MDS, mutational analyses of this gene in MPN may identify a new "epigenetic player" in MPN pathogenesis.
Train_Line_6832 In conclusion, TP53 is the most frequently known altered gene in CK-AML.
Train_Line_6833 The percentage of bone marrow blasts was also lower in SF3B1-mut patients (median: 2% vs 5%; P < .001).
Train_Line_6834 3. WHO classification.
Train_Line_6835 In summary, truncating mutations of BCOR were independently associated with a worse OS in MDS.
Train_Line_6836 Of note, at least two-thirds of mutated cases had biallelic TP53 alteration resulting from hemizygous, compound heterozygous, and homozygous mutations commonly as a result of homologous recombination leading to UPD.
Train_Line_6837 The two leading types of mutations found in AML include internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain (ITD, 17-34%) and mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) activation loop (~7%).
Train_Line_6838 At 2 d after the transfection of BaF3-E cells with Sh2b3 constructs, cells were serum-starved for 6 h, stimulated with 10 iu/ml of Epo for 15 and 60 min, immediately fixed with freshly-prepared paraformaldehyde solution in a final concentration of 1.6% and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol, as previously described (Krutzik & Nolan, 2003; Krutzik et al 2004).
Train_Line_6839 Indeed, patients with mutations in ASXL1, U2AF1, SRSF2, RUNX1, NRAS, and CBL were over-represented in the highest-risk LR-PSS category (P <= .005 for each comparison; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_6840 Low-quality reads (average Phred score < 5) and duplicate reads were removed (supplemental Table 1).
Train_Line_6841 Although no ASXL1 mutation could be detected at diagnosis even using a more sensitive cloning technique, we could not exclude the possibility that minor subpopulations of cells with the ASXL1 mutant existed initially.
Train_Line_6842 We used publicly available RNA-seq data from TCGA data portal for 97 patients (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga).
Train_Line_6843 This results in a functionally more relevant defect that may not be apparent when measuring VWF:Ag and FVIII levels alone and requires the use of assays that assess VWF function (e.g., ristocetin cofactor activity; VWF:RCoA).
Train_Line_6844 EZH2 represents the enzymatic component of the PRC2 complex, which acts as the methyltranferase at H3K27.
Train_Line_6845 However, there are some patients with MF in which no abnormal gene has been found.
Train_Line_6846 MPL mutations have been inconsistently associated with older age, female gender, lower hemoglobin level and higher platelet count no associations with survival or leukemic transformation have been reported.
Train_Line_6847 Correlation of the JAK2V617F mutation status with clinico-pathological features.
Train_Line_6848 Whether somatic mutations are important markers of response to HSCT is not known.
Train_Line_6849 Loss-of-function mutations in 3 genes involved in epigenetic regulation, TET2, ASXL1, and EZH2, may be early events preceding JAK2V617F but may also occur late during disease progression.
Train_Line_6850 As direct sequencing might not be sensitive enough to detect low level of ASXL1 mutant, we therefore did TA cloning of the sample obtained at RAEB from this patient.
Train_Line_6851 Detection of mutations in JAK2 and MPL.
Train_Line_6852 Genomic analysis of these genes in clinically annotated cohorts of AML patients strongly suggests that incorporation of mutational testing for DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2, and ASXL1 may improve our ability to risk-stratify patients with AML and potentially provide additional biomarkers for minimal residual disease detection.
Train_Line_6853 Vasomotor symptoms in ET constitute headaches, lightheadedness, transient neurologic or ocular disturbances, tinnitus, atypical chest discomfort, paresthesias, and erythromelalgia (painful and burning sensation of the feet or hands associated with erythema and warmth).
Train_Line_6854 We found no significant impact for SRSF2 mutation on the time-to-AML-transformation (P = .061; supplemental Figure 2).
Train_Line_6855 Given these differences, we hypothesized that type 1 and type 2 mutations may be associated with qualitatively different phenotypes.
Train_Line_6856 The germline alteration p.I396T was not found in 200 internal controls or in available databases (1,092 controls; http://www.1000genomes.org/and ESP).
Train_Line_6857 Besides the platelet count, mucosal bleeding, infection, severe mucositis, and fever should be considered in the assessment of bleeding risk and should increase the transfusion threshold.
Train_Line_6858 We selected three cases that showed deletion of 5q, including DDX41 locus; one case harbored DDX41 mutation (c.G1574A, p.R525H); and one case showed low expression of DDX41, for which deep RNA-seq (Tarazona et al, 2011) data were available.
Train_Line_6859 LNK, also called SH2B3, is a member of the SH2B family, which contains 2 other members (Table 1, Figure 1).
Train_Line_6860 7.1 Induction therapy.
Train_Line_6861 The fact that in the present study, only SF3B1, not SRSF2, U2AF1, or ZRSR2, were associated with ring sideroblasts, suggests that the latter 3 mutations have a different pathophysiologic effect in the biology of MDS than SF3B1 mutations and underscores the idea that the genes in the splicing machinery have distinct biologic functions.
Train_Line_6862 The effect of SH2B3 W262R polymorphism on cell growth was recently studied (McMullin et al 2011).
Train_Line_6863 Within patients with CN-AML, DNMT3A mutations had an unfavorable effect on OS, RFS, and CR rate in NPM1/FLT3-ITD high-risk but not in low-risk patients.
Train_Line_6864 Our data suggest that the loss of SH2B3 inhibitory function conferred by the PH domain mutations is mild and may collaborate with JAK2 V617F and CBL mutations in order to promote either the development or the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_6865 In addition to BRCC3, other genes encoding components of BRCA1-A and BRISC complexes were also affected by either somatic mutations or deletions.
Train_Line_6866 cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of RNA using the Vilo cDNA kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturers' protocol.
Train_Line_6867 In MDS and PMF, SRSF2 mutations negatively influence both OS and LFS.
Train_Line_6868 Platelet transfusion.
Train_Line_6869 This study also showed that distinguishing between these 2 disorders may be difficult using the WHO criteria, whereas follow-up investigations demonstrated that CSF3R and SETBP1 mutations are not mutually exclusive.
Train_Line_6870 In Drosophila, ASX forms a complex with the ubiquitin carboxyterminal hydrolase calypso to constitute the recently identified polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex.
Train_Line_6871 Generation of mutant GATA2 plasmids and lentiviral expression constructs.
Train_Line_6872 To investigate the interaction of gene mutations in the pathogenesis of adult AML, a complete mutational screening of 11 other genes was performed in all 470 patients.
Train_Line_6873 Two hundred and twenty-six patients with WHO defined CMML and who were seen at the Mayo Clinic from 1997 to 2007 were included in this study.
Train_Line_6874 Sequencing of BCOR and related BCORL1 genes in a cohort of 354 MDS patients identified 4.2% and 0.8% of mutations respectively.
Train_Line_6875 In hematopoietic progenitors and precursors from RARS patients, low levels of ABCB7 expression are typically associated with high levels of FTMT expression.
Train_Line_6876 LNK, a negative regulator of JAK2, is mutated in 13% patients with blast phase MPN, but is rarely targeted by somatic mutations in chronic phase MPN.
Train_Line_6877 However, there are occasional patients who are likely to benefit from JAK inhibitor, as opposed to conventional drug, therapy, including those with intractable pruritus, severe constitutional symptoms or marked splenomegaly.
Train_Line_6878 Infectious third-generation lentivirus was made by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with either 5xUAS-GATA2 (wild-type or mutants) or pF GEV16 Super PGKHygro (GEV16) plasmid and the three packaging plasmids pHCMVwhvgagpolml, pHCMV-G and pHCMVwhvrevml35 (mass ratio 50:5:2.5:1).
Train_Line_6879 They are characterized by two cardinal features: ineffective hematopoiesis leading to bone marrow failure and a propensity to transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_6880 Mutant SH2B3 may collaborate with JAK2 V617F, and CBL and SH2B3 are likely to cooperate in MPN, particularly in CMML.
Train_Line_6881 DOES A PRE-JAK2 EVENT REALLY EXIST?
Train_Line_6882 Germline and somatic DDX41 mutations were associated with normal karyotype disease (70% versus 47% without DDX41 mutations; p = 0.0045; Table S4).
Train_Line_6883 The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the distribution of OS and time to AML progression and to compare differences between survival curves, respectively.
Train_Line_6884 The patient achieved complete remission but relapsed after 15 months.
Train_Line_6885 Methods and any associated references are available in the online v ersion of the paper at http://www.nature.com/naturegenetics/.
Train_Line_6886 Figure 1. Gene mutations in patients with MDS. (A) Location and type of mutations in genes of the splicing machinery in 193 patients with MDS. (B) Associations of gene mutations in our MDS patient cohort outlined by a Circos diagram.
Train_Line_6887 Complex karyotype, which occurs in 10% to 12% of patients, has consistently been associated with a very poor outcome.
Train_Line_6888 These observations suggest that ASXL1 mutations may constitute early hits in leukemogenesis and precede other alterations such as JAK2 and TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_6889 Although abnormal splicing was described to be associated with U2AF35 and SF3B1 mutations, the biologic mechanisms linking the splicing machinery to cellular transformation and leukemogenesis remain elusive.
Train_Line_6890 Because mutation of SRSF2 is supposed to result in loss of its protein function, the frequent occurrence of additional gene mutations at diagnosis and acquisition of new mutations during follow-ups in patients with SRSF2 mutation in the current study support the claim that depletion of SRSF2 may lead to DNA hypermutability.
Train_Line_6891 No other intervention has been convincingly shown to be better.
Train_Line_6892 TaqMan assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_6893 Mutations in epigenetic modifiers in the pathogenesis and therapy of acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_6894 This analysis had limitations, mainly because of lack of information on the timing of acquisition of the SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_6895 A list of the most common recurrently mutated genes in patients with MDS or MDS/MPNs, based on studies published thus far, is reported in Table 3.
Train_Line_6896 Exon 9 mutations affect an early stage of receptor activation and probably act by mimicking the action of the ligand.
Train_Line_6897 Comparison of numerical variables between groups was carried out using a nonparametric approach (Mann-Whitney test or Kruskal-WallisANOVA).
Train_Line_6898 The current survival rate for HSCT using wellmatched donors in patients with MDS is only 40% at 5 years, even in this highly selected population, with relapse and disease-specific mortality responsible for the bulk of deaths.
Train_Line_6899 We investigated the prevalence of somatic mutations in PTPN11 among children with MDS (n = 50).
Train_Line_6900 FLT3-TKD mutations have unknown prognostic and predictive significance in AML.
Train_Line_6901 Even with this low-intensity approach, there was a 30-day mortality of 26%.
Train_Line_6902 Overall and LFS curves were prepared by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test.

Train_Line_6904 In one of the two studies, 77 cases were evaluable after a median follow up of 21 months and 76 and 70% of patients with ET or PV, respectively, achieved a complete hematologic remission, mostly in the first 3 months; side effects were recorded in 96% of the patients and 22% had discontinued treatment.
Train_Line_6905 Unfavorable cytogenetics versus others.
Train_Line_6906 Also none of the 41 patients with wild type TP53 acquired mutations during the disease course, although a significant proportion of those (41%, n = 17) progressed to AML, suggesting TP53 mutations emerge early in the MDS disease pathogenesis.
Train_Line_6907 TP53 alterations correlate with specific CNAs and with the MK category.
Train_Line_6908 Mutations in TP53, TET2, or DNMT3A identify patients with MDS with shorter OS after HSCT.
Train_Line_6909 For targeted detection of sequence alterations, confirmation of WES and assessment of variant allelic frequency (VAF), we applied deep sequencing to targeted exons, as previously described.
Train_Line_6910 DNMT3A mutations are frequent in younger patients with AML and are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.
Train_Line_6911 The frequency of ASXL1 mutation in this study (22.7% in MDS patients defined by the FAB classification and 17.1% in those by the 2008 WHO classification) was comparable to that in the West (19.3%22 and 11-18.5%).
Train_Line_6912 With respect to CLL, the available evidence indicates that SF3B1 mutations are very unlikely to be founding mutations in this lymphoid neoplasm.
Train_Line_6913 Given the number of variables in our prognostic classification, we tested the reproducibility of this predictor in an independent cohort of 104 patients from the ECOG E1900 trial.
Train_Line_6914 Meta-analyses of clinical trials that prospectively assigned allogeneic HSCT versus alternative consolidation therapies for AML in CR1 on an intent-to-treat donor versus no-donor basis show that allogeneic HSCT offers significant OS benefit for patients with intermediate- and high-risk AML.
Train_Line_6915 Requirements for assigning more than one lineage to a single blast population adopted from the WHO classification. Note that the requirement for assigning myeloid lineage in MPAL is more stringent than for establishing a diagnosis of AML. Note also that MPAL can be diagnosed if there are separate populations of lymphoid and myeloid blasts.
Train_Line_6916 The challenge is to provide genetic information in a timely and affordable way and show that this information could prospectively influence treatment decisions.
Train_Line_6917 Although a high degree of variability has been reported in different studies, most studies suggest that the highest allele burden is found in patients with post-PV myelofibrosis (61%), whereas patients with ET have the lowest allele burden (24%).
Train_Line_6918 However, the effects of TET2 mutations on the global and site-specific levels of 5mC were conflicting in these studies.
Train_Line_6919 CEBPA double-mutation and NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD- were independent favorable prognostic factors.
Train_Line_6920 RT-PCR, for which standardized protocols were published by the BIOMED-1 group, is an option to detect these rearrangements, if chromosome morphology is of poor quality, or if there is typical marrow morphology but the suspected cytogenetic abnormality is not present.
Train_Line_6921 Cancer genomes are characterized by global DNA hypomethylation with concomitant hypermethylation of gene promoter regions.
Train_Line_6922 In ET, the presence of JAK2V617F has been associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis and a lower risk of post-ET MF.
Train_Line_6923 At least 3 different genes involved in epigenetic regulation may precede JAK2 mutation in MPNs.
Train_Line_6924 If only the 368 MDS patients based on the 2008 WHO classification were analyzed, eight patients (2.2%) had IDH mutations including one (0.3%) with IDH1 mutation and seven (1.9%) with IDH2 mutation.
Train_Line_6925 In multivariate analysis, DNMT3A mutations remained an independent negative prognostic marker for OS (HR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.15 to 2.21, P = .005, Table 2) when considering DNMT3A mutations, age, hemoglobin, platelet count, secondary versus de novo AML, cytogenetic risk group, NPM1-FLT3-ITD high- versus low-risk group, and MLL5 expression levels.
Train_Line_6926 Amino acid R882, located in the methyltransferase domain of DNMT3A, was the most common mutation site, accounting for 4/13 mutations.
Train_Line_6927 Alternatively, an imbalance between p42 and p30 may affect heterodimerization with other C/EBP members and thus interfere with C/EBP-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation.
Train_Line_6928 Focused on 121 younger CN-AML, the percentage of WT1 mutations was 8.3%, similar to larger cohort studies that analyzed exons 7 and 9 mutations in younger adults with CN-AML (8.5%-10.7%).
Train_Line_6929 Cell culture.
Train_Line_6930 Somatic mutations in STAG2, a gene of the cohesin complex, have been found in ~6% of MDS patients.
Train_Line_6931 The remaining 3 patients (nos. 4, 11, and 19) lost WT1 mutations at relapse.
Train_Line_6932 Of these patients, 63.4% carried the JAK2 V617F mutation, 4.4% carried activating mutations of MPL exon 10, 23.5% carried mutations of CALR exon 9, and only 8.8% had none of these clonal markers.
Train_Line_6933 Myeloid sarcoma occurring de novo should be considered as AML and treated as such.
Train_Line_6934 Because the adjusted P values for NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations (P<=0.10) are close to statistical significance, they should be studied further in prospective trials.
Train_Line_6935 Bacterial infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in neutropenic patients after chemotherapy for AML.
Train_Line_6936 Abbreviations: HDAC, high-dose cytarabine; LDAC, low-dose cytarabine; CBF, core binding factor; AML, acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_6937 No such mutations were observed in patients with abnormal cytogenetics, including recurrent genetic lesions according to WHO 2008 (n = 96), as well as intermediate-risk and adverse karyotypes (n = 35).
Train_Line_6938 Actually, we could not find any ASXL1 mutation in the 44 clones analyzed at diagnosis using cloning technique in patient 107.
Train_Line_6939 Experiments mixing wild-type with p.Thr354Met or p.Thr355del at a 1:1 ratio, mimicking heterozygosity, showed a dominant negative effect of the mutants over wild-type transcription activation in multiple systems (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Fig. 5).
Train_Line_6940 In our cohort with BRCC3 mutations, multiple somatic driver mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities were identified, and one gave a cancer cell survival advantage that enabled genomic instability caused by BRCC3.
Train_Line_6941 On the other hand, extreme thrombocytosis neither defines high-risk disease nor warrants the use of cytoreductive therapy.
Train_Line_6942 CLASS III MUTATIONS: EPIGENETIC MODIFIERS.
Train_Line_6943 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_6944 From these studies, a number of recurrently mutated genes have been identified and, interestingly, many of the newly identified recurrently mutated genes encode proteins that normally function in the epigenetic regulation of transcription.
Train_Line_6945 Mutations previously referenced by the 4 largest studies, to date, are highlighted and referenced.
Train_Line_6946 We therefore hypothesized that high-dose daunorubicin improved the outcomes in patients with daunorubicin who had DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_6947 A large cohort of patients with a MPD were examined.
Train_Line_6948 These mutants lack growth inhibitory properties, possibly through diminished binding of E2F and/or abolished DNA-binding, as suggested by structural analyses.
Train_Line_6949 Two recent studies of pegylated INF-a (~90 mg SC weekly) in PV and ET reported hematologic remissions of ~80% accompanied by decreases in JAK2V617F allele burden (complete molecular remission rate of 5-10%).
Train_Line_6950 This observation underlines the importance of simultaneously evaluating the mutation status of several genes of potential clinical relevance in the molecular prognostication of any myeloid neoplasm, a concept clearly illustrated also by a recent study in AML patients.
Train_Line_6951 AULs often express HLA-DR, CD34, and/or CD38, but by definition lack lineage-associated markers.
Train_Line_6952 New approaches to KIT inhibition.
Train_Line_6953 An essential component of the WHO definition of MDS is the clonal nature of myelodysplastic hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_6954 Selection with puromycin for 24 h resulted in a pure population (>95%) of transduced cells.
Train_Line_6955 Table 2. Clinical characteristics of myeloid malignancies either with or without BRCC3 mutations.
Train_Line_6956 These are likely secondary genetic events, deriving from the genome instability caused by the founding genetic mutation.
Train_Line_6957 Patients carrying an SF3B1 mutation showed a significantly better OS compared with those without mutation (median survival, 90 vs 50 months, P = .001; Figure 3A).
Train_Line_6958 The LR-PSS was developed by incorporating clinical information not present in the IPSS to stratify patients with lower-risk MDS more accurately, but it had not been previously independently validated.
Train_Line_6959 It was found mutated in MDS and AML.
Train_Line_6960 GENES INVOLVED IN INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING.
Train_Line_6961 The function of ASXL1 protein is not fully delineated, but it is suggested that it may be involved in DNA and/or histone modification.
Train_Line_6962 Cell Culture, Lentiviral-Mediated shRNA Knockdown, and Lentiviral Expression Vector.
Train_Line_6963 In Vivo Tumor Xenograft.
Train_Line_6964 We also analyzed 10 AML patients with MLL-PTD, another genetic lesion recurrently observed in CN-AML, and 1 patient was shown to harbor a BCOR mutation.
Train_Line_6965 Nontumoral tissue was analyzed when available (DNA from buccal swab or CD3+ T cells; n = 20).
Train_Line_6966 Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage are rare leukemias and comprise those cases that show no evidence of lineage differentiation (ie, acute undifferentiated leukemia [AUL]) or those with blasts that express markers of more than one lineage (ie, MPAL).
Train_Line_6967 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_6968 UIMC1 deletions (5q35.2) were identified in 11 patients, FAM175A deletions (4q21.23) were present in 8 (Online Supplementary Figure S6) and those involving FAM175B and BABAM1 loci were each present in one patient (data not shown).
Train_Line_6969 Increasing evidence indicates that chromosomal abnormalities play a major role in determining the heterogeneity of MDS.
Train_Line_6970 They identified three patients with FLT3-ITD at diagnosis and seven patients that acquired FLT3-ITD mutation during AML evolution.
Train_Line_6971 Survival data are current to 01/06/2011.
Train_Line_6972 The majority of reported TET2 mutations are likely to cause inactivation of the TET2 protein, suggesting a tumor-suppressor role for this protein.
Train_Line_6973 Associations between BCOR and NPM1 mutations were investigated in a total of 197 NPM1-mutated CN-AML patients (139 of the unselected Italian series and 58 German patients selected for this purpose).
Train_Line_6974 An association of WT1 mutation with FAB M6 subtype and younger age was also found in this study (Table 2).
Train_Line_6975 Because we could not perform germline study with the paired normal cell in each patient, we could not definitely rule out the possibility that these variations were not true somatic mutations, especially for p.R551W and p.I568T.
Train_Line_6976 The other 3 mutations were found in 1 case of refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-II; UPC 1590), one case of CMML-I (UPC 2844) and one case of RAEB-I (UPC 682), in whom no previous mutations were detected.
Train_Line_6977 In our study, TP53 mutation status was the most significant predictor of mortality after transplantation.
Train_Line_6978 In higher eukaryotes, most genes undergo different patterns of splicing, generating alternative mRNA isoforms that have different functions and contribute to biologic complexity.
Train_Line_6979 The detection of MPL W515L or W515K mutation was performed using a Real-QTM MPL W515L/K screening kit (BioSewoom, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_6980 Thus, DDX41 lesions might genuinely induce a pre-leukemic state that predisposes for leukemia.
Train_Line_6981 The pro-leukemogenic properties of DDX41 lesions are supported by the presence of somatic mutations in this gene and the consistent lack of pathognomonic AML lesions, such as typical cytogenetic abnormalities or primary AML-specific mutations.
Train_Line_6982 Among the 32 ASXL1-mutated patients, 27 had disease progression including 19 with AML transformation.
Train_Line_6983 It is of clinical importance to identify the patients with poor-risk genetic alterations, especially in the lower-risk group.
Train_Line_6984 Cytogenetic and mutation analysis.
Train_Line_6985 Overall, a better understanding of the mechanisms of how C/EBPalpha dysregulation participates in the neoplastic process has opened new gateways for differentiation biology research.
Train_Line_6986 Mutations in genes which impact DNA cytosine modifications: DNMT3A and TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_6987 In addition, among the 66 patients enrolled for serial analysis in this study, 4 (50%) of the 8 SRSF2-mutated patients acquired additional mutations of other genes subsequently (Table 4), whereas 11 (19%) of the 58 SRSF2-wild patients did so during follow-ups (data not shown); although the sample size was small, there was a trend of statistical difference in the incidence of genetic evolution between these 2 groups (P = .071 by Fisher exact test).
Train_Line_6988 Alternatively, a RARS patient carrying a mutant SF3B1 gene may acquire another somatic mutation that involves excess of blasts and modifies his/her clinical phenotype from RARS to RAEB.
Train_Line_6989 OS end points, measured from the date of entry into one of the prospective studies, were death (failure) and alive at last follow-up (censored).
Train_Line_6990 In the case of hematologic malignancies associated with SF3B1 mutations, the mutant splicing factor 3b causes abnormal transcription and alternative splicing per se.
Train_Line_6991 DESIGN AND METHODS.
Train_Line_6992 Using deep sequencing, we show that BCOR mutations arise after mutations affecting genes involved in splicing machinery or epigenetic regulation.
Train_Line_6993 However, there are occasional patients who are likely to benefit from JAK inhibitor, as opposed to conventional drug, therapy, including those with intractable pruritus, severe constitutional symptoms, or marked splenomegaly.
Train_Line_6994 SECONDARY RESISTANCE TO KINASE INHIBITORY DRUGS.
Train_Line_6995 Notably, additional patients with AML or ALL carrying SETD2 mutations exhibited decreased levels of global H3K36me3, with the most substantial changes observed in patients with biallelic truncating mutations (Fig. 3c,d).
Train_Line_6996 Other seven patients retained the mutation during follow-ups; among them, four had disease progression including three with leukemic transformation (Table IV).
Train_Line_6997 Tokunaga et al(2010) compared the effect of the oncogenic tyrosine kinases BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F on the development of cells of the erythroid lineage.
Train_Line_6998 The primer pairs were the same as those designed by Yoshida et al The PCR conditions were as follows: 95--degrees--C for 2 minutes; followed by 40 cycles of 95--degrees--C for 30 seconds, 62--degrees--C for 30 seconds, and 72--degrees--C for 30 seconds; and finally, 72--degrees--C for 2 minutes.
Train_Line_6999 Thus, total (biallelic) inactivation of the gene does not seem to be permissive, as we did not find any cases of germline DDX41 mutations followed by somatic deletion of its healthy allele.
Train_Line_7000 This analysis demonstrates that the LR-PSS considers clinical features that capture much of the prognostic information linked with gene mutations associated with a shorter overall survival.
Train_Line_7001 Where appropriate, overlapping primer sets were used to allow for precise quantification of variant allelic burden estimates.
Train_Line_7002 At least one sequencing read (forward or reverse) was obtained for 83% of the 460.1 kbp of target sequence.
Train_Line_7003 When the LR-PSS was applied to this cohort, 57 patients (19.8%) were assigned to risk category 1, with a median survival of 5.19 years (95% CI, 3.01 to 10.34 years); 160 (55.6%) were assigned to category 2, with a median survival of 2.65 years (95% CI, 2.18 to 3.30 years); and 71 (24.7%) were assigned to category 3, with a median survival of 1.11 years (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.51 years, Fig 1; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_7004 SUMMARY.
Train_Line_7005 In 6/11 RARS-T patients the allelic ratio of JAK2V617F was above 50%, indicating the presence of cells homozygous for the mutation.
Train_Line_7006 Whereas p.Leu359Val was similar to wild-type GATA2, p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del resulted in dramatically reduced induction alone (1.5-fold and 0.9-fold, respectively) or with PU.1 (sevenfold and ninefold, respectively, compared to 18-fold with wild-type).
Train_Line_7007 Interestingly, in the 242 MDS patients with normal karyotype, ASXL1 mutation was also an independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio = 2.307, 95% confidence interval = 1.410-3.775, P = 0.001) in addition to older age and NRAS mutation (Table 5).
Train_Line_7008 The distribution of WHO subtypes, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups, and cytogenetic risk groups (according to WHO 200818) is shown in Table 1.
Train_Line_7009 Primers for cDNA amplification and sequencing crossed exon boundaries in all cases.
Train_Line_7010 Since a significant portion of the predictive power of mutations is captured by the LR-PSS, we performed a stepwise multivariable Cox regression analysis to identify mutations that contribute significantly to the prediction of overall survival in addition to existing prognostic scoring systems and would therefore be the most useful to analyze clinically.
Train_Line_7011 Table 1. Clinical characteristics of 221 MDS patients according to SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and U2AF35 mutation status.
Train_Line_7012 We also studied patients with other myeloid neoplasms and found CALR mutations only in a few patients with RARS-T, a myeloid neoplasm with both myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative features.
Train_Line_7013 Haematological malignancies.
Train_Line_7014 Walter et al observed that mutations in driver genes belonging to the same biologic pathway tended not to co-occur, suggesting that a second mutation in the same pathway provides no additional growth advantage or is not even tolerated.
Train_Line_7015 It should also be noted that patients with SF3B1 mutation had a higher percentage of bone marrow erythroblasts than those without mutation.
Train_Line_7016 In fact, the mutant allele burden is typically between 40% and 50%, indicating a dominant bone marrow clone that is heterozygous for the mutation.
Train_Line_7017 JAK2V617F mutation status identifies subtypes of refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_7018 DNA from six patients who showed a DNMT3A mutation at time of diagnosis was also sequenced during remission and relapse phase.
Train_Line_7019 In all patients, mutations were heterozygous and presumably clonally represented in the leukemic population.
Train_Line_7020 The SAVI algorithm (supplemental Figure 1) identified 13 unique nonsynonymous variants (12 missense and 1 out-of-frame deletion) that were present specifically in the tumor DNA (frequencies ranging from 21%-64% of the reads).
Train_Line_7021 We therefore analyzed the prognostic effect of ASXL1 point and frameshift mutations separately.
Train_Line_7022 When point mutations only were considered, no significant impact was seen on time to AML progression (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.208 to 3.695; P = .859; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_7023 NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were found in 10% and 17% of untreated CLL patients and were independently associated with shorter survival in multivariate analysis.
Train_Line_7024 In both male and female AML patients, BCOR mutations consistently targeted the only functional allele.
Train_Line_7025 SNP-A karyotyping, deletions involving the BRCC3 locus (Xq28) were detected in 7 out of 677 (1.0%) patients.
Train_Line_7026 In our cohort, JAK2V617F positive RARS-T patients shared many clinical, laboratory and morphological features with negative patients.
Train_Line_7027 Mutational analyses of ASXL1, CBL, DNMT3A, ETV6, EZH2 IDH1/2, JAK2, NRAS, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 were previously reported.
Train_Line_7028 In total, DDX41 mutations were identified in 27 out of 1,045 patients with myeloid neoplasms (Table 1).
Train_Line_7029 In a retrospective study, aspirin use has also been reported to be beneficial in JAK2V617F-positive low-risk ET, in preventing venous thrombosis, and also in patients with cardiovascular risk factors, in preventing arterial thrombosis.
Train_Line_7030 SF3B1 mutations had a particularly high frequency among conditions characterized by ring sideroblasts, which is consistent with a causal relationship.
Train_Line_7031 Consistently, Setd2 knockdown equipped these pre-leukemic cells to gain a significant growth advantage over serial passaging compared to control shRNA-treated cells in liquid culture (Fig. 4c).
Train_Line_7032 Most frequent gains were +8/+8q (n = 67; 29%), +11/+11q (n = 61; 26%), +21/+21q (n = 39; 17%), +1/+1p (n = 37; 16%), +22/+22q (n = 33; 14%), +13/+13q (n = 29; 12%), +9/+9p (n = 28; 12%), and +19/+19p (n = 25; 11%).
Train_Line_7033 TET2, located on 4q24, is a member of the TET family of proteins (TET1-3).
Train_Line_7034 Homozygous knockout of murine Jak2 results in embryonic death at day 12.5 due to a complete absence of definitive erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_7035 Incorporating additional mutant genes, in particular those associated with unfavorable outcome, might further refine clinical decision making in MDS.
Train_Line_7036 Subsequently, BCOR has also been found to suppress the activity of transcription factors other than BCL6 by participating in the formation of large multiprotein complexes.
Train_Line_7037 The percentages of patients with SETD2 mutations in the groups with wild-type (WT) and rearranged MLL.
Train_Line_7038 This can be a transplant from an HLA identical sibling donor, or a matched unrelated donor.
Train_Line_7039 C/EBPalpha in the hematopoietic system is expressed in HSCs, myeloid progenitors and granulocytes, but not macrophages.
Train_Line_7040 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7041 Some points might explain the conflicting results among different studies.
Train_Line_7042 Hyperleukocytosis with leukostasis and, for example, pulmonary infiltrates or retinal and cerebral hemorrhages requires immediate medical treatment.
Train_Line_7043 This is similar to what has been observed in AML and consistent with a recent report in MDS that underlined the detrimental effect of IDH1 mutations in MDS.
Train_Line_7044 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7045 Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the incidence of the 46/1 genotype between TET2-mutant versus nonmutant patients (20% vs 16% [P = .31] occurrence with an allelic frequency of 20% and 25% for mutant versus nonmutant patients, respectively).
Train_Line_7046 In the present study, we demonstrate that BCOR mutations occur in CN-AML with limited overlap to other genetic mutations and that they may confer an inferior prognosis.
Train_Line_7047 Every mutation was covered with a median of 6415 reads (range, 1160-27766 reads).
Train_Line_7048 Importantly, TET2 mutant clones were also found in T cells, in addition to CD34+ and total bone marrow cells (23.5%, 38.5%, and 43% RMA, respectively).
Train_Line_7049 The SH2B3 PH domain may attenuate baseline signalling from unstimulated receptors, and may, therefore, be more important in MPN cases that do not harbour the JAK2 V617F activating mutation.
Train_Line_7050 Dimerization results in approximation of the basic amino acid residues and is a prerequisite for DNA binding.
Train_Line_7051 Sequential analyses showed all original U2AF1 mutations in U2AF1-mutated patients were retained during follow-ups unless complete remission was achieved, whereas none of the U2AF1-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during disease evolution.
Train_Line_7052 Finally, a randomized study comparing hematocrit targets of <45% or 45 to 50%, using phlebotomy with or without hydroxyurea, was recently published and revealed decreased thrombotic events with the lower hematocrit target (see above).
Train_Line_7053 When analyses were performed in patients with a normal karyotype (cytogenetically normal [CN]), 10% to 15% of cases harbor a C/EBPalpha mutation.
Train_Line_7054 NOTE. Number of patients with mutated gene = 24; with unmutated gene, 124; only frameshift mutations considered. Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicate an increased risk of an event for the first category listed.
Train_Line_7055 The analysis of 1473 patients with MPN revealed a low incidence of IDH1/2 mutations in chronic phase ET, PV, and MF (0.8%, 1.9%, and 4.2%, respectively) contrasting with a 21.6% frequency in blast phase.
Train_Line_7056 Including 3 NPM1wt/BCOR-mut cases of the Italian series analyzed for RUNX1 (2 mutated and 1 wild-type).
Train_Line_7057 This finding may suggest that the phenotype of the MPN induced by LNK mutations may depend on different parameters, including the presence of other mutations.
Train_Line_7058 In adulthood, migration and trafficking of hematopoietic stem cells are of crucial importance in maintaining homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.
Train_Line_7059 Importantly, it seems that certain subsets of patients benefit from this therapy more than others.
Train_Line_7060 Others have shown that STAT3 activation by another RTK, c-Met, depends on trafficking to an endosomal compartment.
Train_Line_7061 Current genetic testing of AML clinical patient samples relies on characterization of metaphase karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction products, and capillary sequencing.
Train_Line_7062 The median number of aberrations per case was 10 (range, 0-51); median numbers of losses, gains, and amplifications per case were 6 (range, 0-43), 2 (range, 0-28), and 0 (range, 0-7), respectively.
Train_Line_7063 The reports regarding sequential studies of ASXL1 mutation in MDS are even less.
Train_Line_7064 Compound nanoparticles that target a TAT-bound protein to specific cell subsets via antibody binding to surface markers, as recently described could be exploited to deliver functional C/EBPalpha to the cytoplasm and nucleus of leukemic blasts via for example a CD33 antibody targeting myeloid cells in order to induce granulocytic-monocytic differentiation.
Train_Line_7065 Myelodysplasia is a term used in pathology for describing morphologic abnormalities, or dysplasia, in >=1 of the major myeloid cell lines of hematopoiesis and is a typical feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).
Train_Line_7066 Thirdly, SOCS3 directly inhibits JAK2-related signaling by binding to a cytokine receptor and interacting with JAK2.
Train_Line_7067 Genome-wide gene expression analysis of blasts from AML patients using unsupervised clustering revealed that C/EBPalpha mutant cases cluster together, suggesting that they share similar gene expression signatures.
Train_Line_7068 Clinical significance of SF3B1 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_7069 Together, these genes identified a population of patients with substantially shortened OS (median, 7.4 months; 95% CI, 4.4 to 12.6 v not reached [NR]; 95% CI, 19.5 to NR) and PFS (median, 4.6 months; 95% CI, 2.8 to 8.0 v NRl 95% CI, 6.3 to NR).
Train_Line_7070 RESULTS.
Train_Line_7071 As such, ASXL1 mutations may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of PMF, as well as in the molecular progression from the chronic phase of a previous PV or ET to MF.
Train_Line_7072 Figure 4. Negative impact on OS and on the cumulative incidence of AML transformation of BCOR truncating mutations in MDS patients. (A) Kaplan-Meier curve for OS and (B) cumulative incidence of AML transformation according to BCOR mutation status (Fine & Gray test). (C) Univariate and multivariate analyses for OS in MDS patients.
Train_Line_7073 Five (8%) patients among this mutation group had 1% BM RS, of which 8% had <15% RS, 11% had 15-49% RS and 0% had >50% RS.
Train_Line_7074 However, in UPC 1932, we detected an expansion of the TET2 mutation from 50% to 97% RMA for CD34+ and total bone marrow, respectively.
Train_Line_7075 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_7076 TP53 alterations were identified in 157 of 219 (72%) CK-AMLs that could be analyzed by conventional cytogenetics.
Train_Line_7077 This finding is in accord with recent reports in AML and MDS, which demonstrated a strong association of DNMT3A mutations with adverse outcome.
Train_Line_7078 Activating somatic mutations in CSF3R have been recently detected in ~90% of patients with CNL and in ~40% of those with aCML.
Train_Line_7079 So far, individual risk assessment in MDS has been based on the use of scoring systems that include clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic parameters.
Train_Line_7080 Mutations in TET2, however, are enriched in cytogenetically defined intermediate-risk AML or CN-AML where the frequency of TET2 mutations is 18% to 23%.
Train_Line_7081 Figure 3. Dynamic representation of clonal dominance in the presence of TET2 and/or JAK2 mutations in the HSC, hematopoietic stem progenitor (HPC), and mature fractions. JAK2V617F would mainly expand the mature fraction, whereas TET2 mutation would mainly expand the HPC fraction. TET2 and JAK2 mutations are synergistic by combining an early and late amplification. The order of mutations would not matter if they occur before the development of a full-blown disorder. All numbers and ratios are arbitrary.
Train_Line_7082 The benefit might be highest for patients with a low or intermediate transplant risk.
Train_Line_7083 The median follow-up of patients alive was 3 years.
Train_Line_7084 In this regard, treatment is tailored to individual patients according to their risk for thrombosis or bleeding (Table IV).
Train_Line_7085 In general, JAK2V617F clusters with older age, higher hemoglobin level, leukocytosis, and lower platelet count.
Train_Line_7086 This observation has indeed been made by us (Figure 4) and others.
Train_Line_7087 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_7088 More recently KIT was shown to be necessary for the development and function of gut pacemaker cells, the Interstitial Cells of Cajal (ICC).
Train_Line_7089 In contrast, Bejar et al showed that IDH2 mutation, but not IDH1 mutation, was associated with poor prognosis in MDS patients in univariate analysis.
Train_Line_7090 Either mono- or bi-cytopenia: hemoglobin level <10 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count <1.8 x 109/L, or platelet count <100 x 109/L. However, higher blood counts do not exclude the diagnosis in the presence of unequivocal histological/cytogenetic evidence for myelodysplastic syndrome.
Train_Line_7091 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7092 Iron stains of bone marrow aspirates consistently revealed coarse iron granules which partially or completely encircled the nuclei of >15% red cell precursors (Figures 1B; 2A, E; 3B, E, H, insets).
Train_Line_7093 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7094 Mutation analysis.
Train_Line_7095 ABL (ABL FusionQuant Standards; Ipsogen, Marseille, France) was quantified as a control gene.
Train_Line_7096 This is the only study, to-date, which randomized patients with ET to a drug vs. no drug.
Train_Line_7097 To characterize the unknown MLL fusion gene that resulted from the chromosomal rearrangement and detect all potential cooperative somatic genomic changes, we obtained 55x and 62x whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data covering 98.48% and 98.46% of the genomes of CD56+CD64+ leukemia cells from the patient and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from her healthy twin sister, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
Train_Line_7098 All of the above mentioned spliceosome factors are involved in a 30 -splice site recognition of pre-mRNA, including abnormal/alternative splicing.

Train_Line_7100 Horiike et al first reported FLT3-ITD mutations in 7 of 92 patients with MDS (3%).
Train_Line_7101 SH2B3 PH domain mutants (EQ, GV, and AV) were able to bind JAK2 similar to WT SH2B3 (Fig 5A).
Train_Line_7102 Sequential study of IDH mutations during clinical follow-ups.
Train_Line_7103 The germline mutations were N-terminal mutations in all cases succeeded by a C-terminal somatic mutation in the leukemic blasts suggesting that the combination of these mutations induces AML but is still tolerated by myeloid cells, while a biallelic combination of two C-terminal or two N-terminal mutations is deleterious to the cells and would induce apoptosis instead of AML.
Train_Line_7104 Myeloid sarcoma (synonyms: extramedullary myeloid tumor, granulocytic sarcoma, chloroma) is a tumor mass consisting of myeloid blasts in which the tissue architecture is effaced, occurring at an anatomical site other than the bone marrow, most commonly in skin, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, bone, soft tissue, and testis.
Train_Line_7105 Examination of peripheral blood smears from MPLW515L mice revealed marked thrombocytosis and leukocytosis composed of predominantly mature myeloid elements admixed with occasional to frequent numbers of nucleated erythroid cells (Figure 4A and 4B).
Train_Line_7106 In general, JAK2V617F clusters with older age, higher hemoglobin level, leukocytosis, and lower platelet count.
Train_Line_7107 Mutations in SRSF2, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and SF3B1 were found in 24 (12.4%), 14 (7.3%), 6 (3.1%), and 28 (14.5%) patients, respectively, corresponding to a total of 67 of 193 MDS patients (34.7%).
Train_Line_7108 Multiple different mutations are responsible for constitutive activity of KIT in a tumour-selective fashion.
Train_Line_7109 The incidence and impact of FLT3 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains poorly defined.
Train_Line_7110 Cells were infected twice on RetroNectin-coated dishes with either MIG or MIG-Sh2b3 retroviral supernatants and after 2 d sorted for GFP expression.
Train_Line_7111 These considerations suggest that, in a portion of patients, RARS-T may develop through sequential acquisition of SF3B1 and JAK2 mutations, as represented schematically in Figure 5.
Train_Line_7112 In univariable analyses, donor type and conditioning regimen were no longer predictive of OS in this group, but mutations in TP53 remained strongly associated with OS and PFS.
Train_Line_7113 This is in contrast to Kosmider et al, who have, in 2 separate studies, shown TET2 mutations as an independent favorable prognostic factor in MDS and associated with poor outcome in CMML patients.
Train_Line_7114 Sensitivity analyses were performed on CR and RFS, and results are displayed for exploratory purposes.
Train_Line_7115 TP53 (NC_000017-9) mutations were analysed in DNA from Ficoll-separated BM mononuclear cells using the Roche Genome Sequencer (GS) FLX sequencing platform as described previously (Smith et al 2010).

Train_Line_7117 9. Therapy-related AML.
Train_Line_7118 "BCR-ABL1-negative MPN" is an operational sub-category of MPN that includes polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Train_Line_7119 The marked increase in megakaryocytes seen in the histopathology of MPLW515L mice was corroborated by an ~15-fold increase in the percentage of CD41+ cells in MPLW515L bone marrow compared with MPLWT (Figure 5A, bottom panels).
Train_Line_7120 Risk stratification: Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors.
Train_Line_7121 Figure 5. The quantitative nature of NGS provides greater insight into LOH events. For UPC 2719, representative sequence read-out for one SNP (A) and 2 mutations (B-C) are displayed alongside SNP array data (D), showing a UPD over the TET2 locus. (A) An A to G SNP found in TET2 exon 11 is depicted by the dominant black bar and is found at 68% RMA (68% variation from the reference sequence indicated on the left axis), indicative of homozygosity and LOH in a population with mixed clonality. (B-C) Likewise, a C to T mutation in TET2 exon 7 is found at 69% RMA and another in exon 10 at 22% RMA, respectively, again indicative of multiple and distinct disease clones. The sequence coverage (number of reads) across the regions is indicated outside or inside the right axis in panel A or panels B and C, respectively, and traced by the blue lines in all cases. (D) Consistent with the sequence data, SNP6 array data show a region with LOH, indicative of UPD, highlighted by the green bar. The top panel represents a smooth copy number signal plot and a copy number of 2. The bottom panel shows individual genotypes for the SNP probes and a background of AB heterozygote calls consistent with mixed clonality.
Train_Line_7122 Although it was not listed in the dbSNP, we regarded it as one of polymorphisms, because it was detected in one of 50 normal controls.
Train_Line_7123 Comparison of white patients with nonwhite patients.
Train_Line_7124 RESULTS.
Train_Line_7125 RAS mutations occur in 12% to 27% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and enhance sensitivity to cytarabine in vitro. We examined whether RAS mutations impact response to cytarabine in vivo.
Train_Line_7126 These mutations were frequently hemizygous and present in nonsense and frameshift forms.
Train_Line_7127 Previous estimates of LNK mutation prevalence have ranged from 6.1 to 25%.
Train_Line_7128 There was no clustering of mutations around the common hot spots, and only mutations affecting codons 163, 173, 248 and 273 were present in two patients each.
Train_Line_7129 Survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method.
Train_Line_7130 Prophylaxis with itraconazole, posaconazole, or amphotericin, that is, drugs with antimold activity, reduced the risk of documented aspergillus infection and likely had some effect on mortality.
Train_Line_7131 Nonetheless, the development of these novel therapeutics has already resulted in a number of phase 1 studies in patients with hematologic malignancies, including phase 1 trials of the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 and of the bromodomain inhibitor OTX015.
Train_Line_7132 These findings await validation in prospective trials.
Train_Line_7133 We identified a common region of UPD spanning chromosome 4q24 in 8% of MDS patients that has been confirmed by other groups and led to the discovery of mutations in the TET2 gene.
Train_Line_7134 Resequencing of CALR, encoding calreticulin, was then performed in cohorts of patients with myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_7135 This is in contrast to murine bone marrow transplant experiments with constitutively activated tyrosine kinase alleles evaluated in our laboratory and by others, including TEL-JAK2, FLT3-ITD, and FIP1L1-PDGFRA, that each result in a neutrophilic MPD without involvement of the megakaryocyte lineage.
Train_Line_7136 Amplicon sequencing of other myeloid specific genes.
Train_Line_7137 Similarly, FLT3-ITD, a frequent genetic lesion in CN-AML, does not appear to play a major cooperating role in BCOR-mutated AML.
Train_Line_7138 Most eukaryotic genes have coding sequences (exon) and noncoding (intron) sequences and are initially expressed as precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) that includes all of these sequences (Figure 1).
Train_Line_7139 CALR mutations are the second most frequent mutation after JAK2 in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_7140 However, high C/EBPalpha mRNA and protein were demonstrated in several of these BP-ALL cells, which normally do not express any C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_7141 In this large cohort study, we found that IDH2 mutation was a poor prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in lower-risk MDS patients.
Train_Line_7142 The genomic regions that span exon 12 of ASXL1, exons 8 and 9 of CBL, exons 15 to 23 of DNMT3A, the entire coding regions of ETV6 and EZH2, exons 4 of IDH1 and IDH2, exon 14 of JAK2, exons 1 and 2 of NRAS, exons 3 to 8 of RUNX1, the entire coding region of TET2, and exons 5 to 8 of TP53 were analyzed as previously reported.
Train_Line_7143 Of course, replacement therapy for a nuclear transcription factor is a serious technical challenge.
Train_Line_7144 Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is mediated by DNA methyltransferases, including DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.
Train_Line_7145 PCR fragments were directly sequenced in both directions and were analyzed using the Mutation surveyor Version 3.97 software (Softgenetics).
Train_Line_7146 Use of KIT kinase inhibitors has provided a paradigm shift in treatment of these cancers.
Train_Line_7147 The incidence of JAK2V617F in our series (11/23 cases; 48%) fits well in the range reported in previous studies of RARS-T.
Train_Line_7148 Using this approach, Papaemmanuil et al identified 62 point mutations with a predominance of transitions across 8 RARS patients.
Train_Line_7149 FLT3 mutation was analyzed as previously described.
Train_Line_7150 Typical of the Type III RTK family, the KIT protein consists of an extracellular region made up of five immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular region including a split kinase domain and auto-regulatory domains.
Train_Line_7151 Primers and probes for all genes analyzed were purchased from Applied Biosystems gene expression assays products (DDX41: Hs00169602_m1; and GAPDH: Hs99999905_m1).
Train_Line_7152 Statistically significant (P < .05).
Train_Line_7153 In AML, TP53 alterations (mutations and/or losses, TP53-altered) are rare and have been closely associated with CK-AML.
Train_Line_7154 In univariate analysis, BCOR mutations were associated with poor prognosis in MDS (overall survival [OS]: P = .013; cumulative incidence of AML transformation: P = .005).
Train_Line_7155 WHY WAS THIS STUDY DONE?
Train_Line_7156 IDH mutations are closely associated with mutations of DNMT3A, ASXL1 and SRSF2 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and are stable during disease evolution.
Train_Line_7157 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7158 A likely hypothesis is that they facilitate clonal selection, allowing the dominance of the JAK2V617F subclone during the chronic phase and, together with cooperating mutations, promote blast crisis.
Train_Line_7159 PV or ET patients who are either intolerant or resistant to hydroxyurea are effectively managed by INF-a (pegylated preparations preferred) or busulfan.
Train_Line_7160 In contrast to the RUNX1/CEBPA mutations (Owen et al, 2008), DDX41 mutations induce disease at age >40 years.
Train_Line_7161 TP53 mutations in patients with tMDS frequently harboured double mutations (4 of 6, 67%), in comparison with patients with isolated 5q (1 of 5, 20%) and RAEB (5 of 12, 41%) [P < 0.001].
Train_Line_7162 One CMML patient showed a BCORL1 mutation (1/54 = 1.8%; 95% CI, 0.3-9.8).
Train_Line_7163 CALR MUTATIONS AND A NOVEL C-TERMINAL PEPTIDE IN MUTANT CALR.
Train_Line_7164 ASXL1 and concomitant mutations in myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_7165 The French ALFA 9803 trial found that 6 cycles of outpatient consolidation (daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 or idarubicin 9 mg/m2 on day 1 and cytarabine 60 mg/m2 per q12h subcutaneously [s.c.] on days 1-5) gave superior DFS and OS than 1 cycle of "4 + 7" consolidation.
Train_Line_7166 However, clinically relevant AvWS can occur even when the platelet count is well below 1,000 x 109 /L, and that laboratory evaluation of AvWS must be performed in the presence of abnormal bleeding, regardless of platelet count.
Train_Line_7167 Correlation with chromosome abnormalities.
Train_Line_7168 The elegant study by Bejar et al has illustrated the clinical effect of point mutations in MDS, in particular the potential of molecular data for facilitating diagnosis, improving prognostication, and allowing the evaluation of disease progression.
Train_Line_7169 The patients with SRSF2 mutation had significantly higher incidences of RUNX1, ASXL1, and IDH2 mutations than those without the mutation (29.4% vs 10.1%, P = .004; 47.1% vs 19.6%, P < .001; and 20.6% vs 2.5%, P < .001, respectively; Table 2).
Train_Line_7170 Mutated NPM1 was found in three of 33 studied patients with AML following MDS; of these, one also had mutated IDH1.
Train_Line_7171 Patients with DDX41 mutations responded better to lenalidomide treatment (Figure 3E).
Train_Line_7172 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_7173 It was subsequently shown that patients with exon 9 mutation responded better to an escalated dose of imatinib.
Train_Line_7174 Although epigenetic silencing of TP53 promoter has been reported in myeloma (Hurt et al 2006), hypermethylation of the promoter region was neither detected in patients with wild type TP53 nor in patients with TP53 mutations in the limited number of patients analysed.
Train_Line_7175 One patient showed an increase in clone size (60-93%) at the time of leukaemic evolution and the remaining four patients had stable TP53 clones after 5-azacitidine, which was associated with a lack of clinical response to 5-azacitidine.
Train_Line_7176 CD34+ cell purification, RNA preparation, hybridization to the Affymetrix U133plus2 arrays, and analysis of data were performed as previously described for these samples.
Train_Line_7177 FLT3 occurs in MDS and CMML at a lower frequency than AML and does not predict C poor outcome.
Train_Line_7178 RS are erythroid precursors with iron-laden mitochondria forming a perinuclear ring and are common in patients with myeloid neoplasms, including MDS, MPN, and MDS/MPN overlap syndromes.
Train_Line_7179 Attention should be given to a careful evaluation and documentation of comorbidities.
Train_Line_7180 We expected more severe phenotype will result in cases with two mutations than those with only one mutation, based on a previous study that reported the augmented ability of oncogenic JAK2 to expand myeloid progenitors in LNK-deficient mice.
Train_Line_7181 TET2 mutations are an early event.
Train_Line_7182 Patients with either low expression or DDX41 mutations (7/9) showed better response rate (78% versus 20%) compared to others (Figure 3G).
Train_Line_7183 Using this strategy, we identified recurrent mutations affecting the DNMT3A and BCOR genes.
Train_Line_7184 The latter is supported by 2 studies showing that, in MPN, the acquisition of TET2 mutations is associated with transformation to AML, and additional mutations in genes, such as ASXL1 or IDH1, are present in either a TET2 mutant or wild-type background bone marrow culture.
Train_Line_7185 Amplification products were purified and sequenced.
Train_Line_7186 To identify germline and somatic mutations in subjects with familial AML, a panel of 50 hematopoietic candidate genes, incorporating a total of 638 exons, was assembled (Supplementary Table 1).
Train_Line_7187 This is due to the fact that ET and not PV erythroid colonies are characterized by constitutive activation of STAT1, possibly via activation of IFN-gamma receptor 2 or another STAT1-activating receptor.
Train_Line_7188 Mononuclear cells from diagnostic bone marrow samples were enriched by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were stored in liquid nitrogen until use.
Train_Line_7189 No significant differences in age, sex, karyotype, blood counts, or BM blasts between BCOR-mut and BCOR-wt patients was observed.
Train_Line_7190 In the current study, SRSF2 mutation possessed negative impact on OS in MDS patients, especially for those with lower risk disease, similar to the finding of Makishima et al.
Train_Line_7191 IZF1 deletions or TP53 mutations are mainly found at transformation phases and are present at greater frequency than in de novo acute myeloid leukemias.
Train_Line_7192 One hundred and ninety-one patients (84%) had CMML-1 with a median OS of 21 months, while 35 patients had CMML-2 with a median OS of 15 months.
Train_Line_7193 Replacement of Thr354 with the bulky methionine moiety is predicted to alter the ZF2 structure by affecting zinc contacts.
Train_Line_7194 SRSF2 mutations are associated with shortened overall (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) in both MDS and myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_7195 Acquired mutations of transcription factors have been described not only in AML but also in MDS.
Train_Line_7196 All CpG dinucleotides had a methylated cytosine.
Train_Line_7197 C/EBPalpha mutations (15% of all CN-AML cases) do not segregate with any other known mutations, such as NPM1, Flt3 or MLL mutations.
Train_Line_7198 We recently identified a fourth family in which a father and son, both affected by MDS, shared a heterozygous 3-bp heritable deletion in GATA2 (c.1063-1065delACA) resulting in p.Thr355del (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Train_Line_7199 The link between DNMTs and cancer comes from observations that elevated levels of DNMT proteins and activities occur in many types of cancers, and overexpression of DNMT1 in cells can lead to transformation (reviewed in 3).
Train_Line_7200 There was no significant prognostic association between TET2 mutations and World Health Organization subtypes, International Prognostic Scoring System score, cytogenetic status, or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_7201 The present study is the first to use NGS and high-resolution SNP array technology in 355 and 91 MDS/CMML patients, respectively, to simultaneously map and quantify mutant TET2 clones and additional genomic aberrations, and correlate the findings to the clinical status of these patients.
Train_Line_7202 Therefore, to determine whether RAS mutation status also influences response to cytarabine in vivo, we have analyzed retrospectively the outcome of patients with AML with and without RAS mutations enrolled onto a single treatment study, CALGB 8525.
Train_Line_7203 SF3B1 mutations in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_7204 The distribution and co-occurrence of mutations is shown in Figure 2.
Train_Line_7205 Such genomic pattern associated with TP53 alterations may pinpoint to candidates cooperating in p53-dependent leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_7206 By contrast, the expression level of SOCS3 in the same group of patients was similar to that in patients with untransformed PV or ET (data not shown).
Train_Line_7207 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7208 In the last decade, genomic studies have identified multiple recurrent somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_7209 The working hypothesis is that cells harboring a spliceosome mutation may be more sensitive to spliceosome modulators.
Train_Line_7210 Dasatinib, which has higher activity on D816 mutant KIT, is currently being trialled in AML (http://clinicaltrials.gov), for example in combination with induction chemotherapy in AML (NCT01238211) and in maintenance therapy in CBF AML (NCT00850382).
Train_Line_7211 To get insights into the hierarchy of somatic mutations in BCOR-mutated patients, we first evaluated mutant-copy burden in flow-sorted BM cells from a female patient UPN3 (Table 3 and Figure 2) using deep-sequencing technologies.
Train_Line_7212 This, in my opinion, is the reason for the apparent association in some studies between leukemic transformation and drug therapy in PV or ET.
Train_Line_7213 These results support previous studies, which suggest that TET2 mutations and genomic aberrations affecting the 4q24 locus are independent events.
Train_Line_7214 One striking observation is the increasing incidence of adverse versus favorable cytogenetic abnormalities with increasing age. This, at least in part, contributes to the poorer outcome of AML in older adults.
Train_Line_7215 Although TET2 mutations were detected in only a small fraction of CD34+ CD38- cells, they were present in a high proportion of more mature progenitors.
Train_Line_7216 This was also true when looking at frameshift mutations separately.
Train_Line_7217 Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 109 /L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding.
Train_Line_7218 For example, the observation that TET2 and IDH mutations were mutually exclusive in this AML cohort led to functional studies linking IDH mutations and loss-of-function TET2 mutations in a shared mechanism of hematopoietic transformation.
Train_Line_7219 Diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukemia in adults: recommendations from an international expert panel, on behalf of the European LeukemiaNet.
Train_Line_7220 U2AF1 mutation could also predict shorter time-to-leukemia transformation (TTL) in younger patients (P = 0.020).
Train_Line_7221 In general, activating mutations in the JAK2/STAT pathway (e.g.
Train_Line_7222 Current treatments for MF include empiric therapies such as hydroxyurea or interferon, and splenectomy for symptomatic splenomegaly.
Train_Line_7223 The slight loss of SH2B3 function conveyed by the PH domain mutations in our studies dampened signalling through STAT5 more than signalling through MAPK-ERK.
Train_Line_7224 BCOR mutations are mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations.
Train_Line_7225 Although no specific targets of epigenetic mutations seen in MPN have been developed, several attempts to use epigenetically active drugs, such as hypomethylating agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors have been used in MPN.
Train_Line_7226 However, inhibition of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which are responsible for the covalent linking of methyl groups to the CpG dinucleotide, is only one potential mechanism of action of 5-azacytidine and decitabine.
Train_Line_7227 PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Train_Line_7228 Early clinical trials of imatinib for treatment of patients with metastatic GIST showed remarkable success.
Train_Line_7229 c-CBL, the founding member, is the cellular counterpart of a murine viral oncogene involved in B-cell and myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_7230 With a median follow-up duration of 58.2 months (range, 0.1-250.7 months), there was a close correlation between ASXL1 mutations and acute leukemia transformation (39.0% vs 17.7%; P<0.001).
Train_Line_7231 RUNX1 mutations were detected in 8 of 18 (44.4%) BCOR-mutated patients.
Train_Line_7232 Polyclonal rabbit alpha-GATA2 (H-116) antibody (Cat.
Train_Line_7233 The current study was approved by the Mayo Clinic institutional review board.
Train_Line_7234 Within this cohort, 299 samples were from patients with IPSS low- or intermediate-1 risk (10 of which were missing data required to calculate the LR-PSS, and one of which was excluded for being a member of the original cohort used to define the LR-PSS).
Train_Line_7235 In addition, even assuming that an SF3B1 mutation can cause clonal expansion and dominance of hematopoietic progenitors, it remains to be explained how the same mutation results in defective maturation of immature RBCs leading to ineffective erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_7236 Sequence analysis of matched normal DNA derived from buccal swabs did not identify the MPLW515L substitution (Figure 1A, upper trace), demonstrating that MPLW515L is a somatic mutation in hematopoietic cells.
Train_Line_7237 The former category "AML with 11q23 (MLL) abnormalities" was redefined in that "AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23); MLLT3-MLL" is now a unique entity; balanced translocations other than that involving MLLT3 should be specified in the diagnosis.
Train_Line_7238 However, CBL may have numerous targets other than RTK, including JAK2 and cytokine receptors such as MPL.
Train_Line_7239 The relative risk of death of the JAK2 mutation positive patients was 79% lower than that of the negative group, with 5-year survival probabilities of 86% vs 62%.
Train_Line_7240 Primer sequences were as follows: First round PCR 5'-TTATAGT TTTGGTTTGTAGAAT (left) and 5'-TAACTCAAAAAAAAC TCATCAA (right); Nested PCR 5'-TTATAGTTTTGGTTT GTAGAATT (left) 5'-ATCAAAAACTTACCCAATCCAAAAA (right); Sequencing promoter region 1 5'-GGGTTTTTTTT TTTTATGTGTTTAAGA-T;Sequencing promoter region 2 5'-TTATAGTTTT-GGTTTGTAGAATT.
Train_Line_7241 As shown in Figure 4A, there was a significant difference in overall survival among the three subgroups of patients with primary myelofibrosis (P<0.001).
Train_Line_7242 Ultimately, however, mutated hematopoietic stem cells achieve full clonal dominance in the bone marrow, and the vast majority of circulating mature cells derive from the dominant clone (Figure 2, step 2).
Train_Line_7243 Patterns of U2AF1 mutation and its correlations with clinical features and other mutations U2AF1 mutation was detected in 36 (7.5%) of the 478 patients.
Train_Line_7244 Prospective validation of the prognostic impact of C/EBPalpha mutational status is awaited to determine the clinical impact of C/EBPalpha mutation analysis.
Train_Line_7245 Multiple clinical correlative studies of IDH1/2 mutations, however, have identified a statistically significant association between IDH1/2 mutations and NPM1 mutations and mutual exclusivity of IDH1/2 mutations and TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_7246 SF3B1 mutations have a high prevalence (~80%) in MDS and ring sideroblasts (RS) and do not influence either OS or leukemiafree survival (LFS).
Train_Line_7247 Figure 2. Overall survival of FLT3-mutated MDS patients versus FLT3-nonmutated CMML patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival (OS) for FLT3-mutated MDS patients versus FLT3-nonmutated CMML patients. The OS did not differ significantly for FLT3-mutated versus FLT3-nonmutated patients. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]
Train_Line_7248 Consideration must be given to both the health of the mother and to the immediate as well as long-term consequences for the fetus exposed to cytotoxic agents.
Train_Line_7249 Prognostic impact of SRSF2 mutation on OS.
Train_Line_7250 In the remaining four cases, the mutant allele predominated (>50%T), demonstrating that cells homozygous for JAK2V617F were present.
Train_Line_7251 Here, we confirmed that SRSF2 mutation was more prevalent in CMML than in other MDS subtypes, as reported previously; however, it occurred with similar frequency in patients with lower risk and higher risk MDS.
Train_Line_7252 In contrast, patients with complex cytogenetics and no TP53 mutation had OS comparable to that of patients without complex cytogenetics (Fig 2B).
Train_Line_7253 In 150 patients with mutated CALR for whom we had matched T-lymphocyte DNA available, the mutations were somatic.
Train_Line_7254 Figure 2. Mutations in CALR and the Generation of a Novel C-Terminal Peptide in the Calreticulin Protein. Panel A shows the genomic positions of all 36 mutation types detected in the current study. Red bars indicate deletions, blue letters inserted nucleotide sequences, and orange letters somatically acquired substitutions. Black lines connecting deletions or insertions with substitutions indicate their occurrence on the same allele. The red bars and black lines are drawn to scale. The most frequent mutations, type 1 and type 2, are marked. 3'UTR denotes 3' untranslated region. Panel B is a schematic representation of the three alternative peptide sequences derived from the three reading frames across exon 9 of CALR. Each bar represents an amino acid: blue bars indicate negatively charged amino acids, red bars positively charged amino acids, and black bars stop codons. Panel C shows the specific peptide makeup of nonmutant CALR and of the two most frequently detected types of mutations. Panel D shows the relative frequencies of all 36 mutation types observed in CALR. Percentages do not sum to 100 because of rounding.
Train_Line_7255 Lenalidomide-treated patients had an improved OS compared with all other patients (P = .027); however, all patients had 5q- syndrome, which has a better prognosis per se.
Train_Line_7256 In our cohort of 1444 cases analyzed by next generation sequencing, somatic mutations in the gene BRCA1-BRCA2-containing complex 3 (BRCC3) were identified in 28 cases (1.9%).
Train_Line_7257 V5 immunoprecipitation was performed with V5-tagged WT and mutant DDX41 (R525H) in HEK293 cells.
Train_Line_7258 All other point mutations identified occurred in one patient each (Table 2).
Train_Line_7259 The Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) recently reported a longterm survival probability of 30% for AML patients with adverse cytogenetics transplanted in CR1 from matched unrelated donors.
Train_Line_7260 Refractory anemia has no peculiar genotype thus far, raising the question as to whether it should be considered as a separate entity.
Train_Line_7261 This is in contrast to C/EBPalpha knockout mice, which lack all C/EBPalpha isoforms completely and fail to support the transition from CMPs to GMPs.
Train_Line_7262 This contention was confirmed by the most recent study from the European collaboration study on low-dose aspirin in polycythemia (ECLAP).
Train_Line_7263 Moreover, knockout of Sh2b3 cooperates with JAK2 activating variants in the formation of myeloproliferative disease in a murine bone marrow transplantation model (Bersenev et al 2010), supporting the importance of SH2B3 in the inhibition of the JAK2-STAT pathway.
Train_Line_7264 Alternatively, liposomal cytarabine (50 mg every other week) may be given for approximately 6 cycles.
Train_Line_7265 In addition, because of the potential risk for bleeding, low-risk patients with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 x 109 /L) are considered separately (Table IV).
Train_Line_7266 Figure 3. Deep sequencing reveals low-level mutant clones. (A) After deeper sequencing at 450X coverage for 96 patients, an additional 4 mutations were identified, which were present at between 3% and 6.3% RMA within total bone marrow DNA. One of these mutations was found in a patient with an additional mutation, which had previously been identified. Means and standard deviations for RMA corresponding to 3 independent experiments are shown. (B) Representative sequence readout for 1 of these mutations is exampled and shows an A>G substitution, denoted by the prominent black bar, in 6% of sequence reads (6% variation from the reference sequence, left axis), leading to a Q1414H nonsynonymous amino acid change. The sequence depth is 820X across this region traced by the gray line running across the top of the graph. Experimental noise accounts for <= 1% of variation.
Train_Line_7267 Although this will need to be validated in other cohorts and investigated in functional systems, these clinical data suggest a mechanistic link between DNMT3A, NPM1, or fusions in MLL1 and relative resistance to anthracyclines.
Train_Line_7268 Subsequently a subset of melanoma cases, mostly those with accral or mucosal phenotype, and lacking B-Raf or K-Ras mutations, have been shown to have activating KIT mutations, most commonly L576P (exon 11) or K642E (exon 13) (e.g., [78]).
Train_Line_7269 For prevention of arachnoiditis, dexamethasone (4 mg three times a day [tid] p.o.) may be considered on the days of intrathecal application.
Train_Line_7270 When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation highly suggests the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis.
Train_Line_7271 Next-generation sequencing allowed the identification of a BCOR inactivating mutation in an IPSS intermediate-1 low-risk patient who suffered from an aggressive disease course with AML progression within 5 months after diagnosis and death 8 months later.
Train_Line_7272 In accordance with the nomenclature recently proposed for MPD by the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment, we designated cases exhibiting myelofibrosis (MF) or leukemic transformation as RARS-T MF or blast phase (BP) disease.
Train_Line_7273 To determine whether we were missing any frequent low-level mutation events, additional sequencing experiments of 13 TET2 mutation-negative patients within this subgroup were performed to increase the average sequence depth to > 900X.
Train_Line_7274 In a comprehensive analysis of the ASXL1 gene, we identified ASXL1 mutations as an unfavorable prognostic marker in patients with MDS.
Train_Line_7275 In a study aimed at defining the relationship between dysfunction in SF3B1 and formation of ring sideroblasts, Visconte et al found that meayamycin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of the splicing factor 3b complex, induced the formation of ring sideroblasts in healthy BM cells in vitro.
Train_Line_7276 Methylation assessment of SOCS1 and SOCS3.
Train_Line_7277 Nine of 11 cases with familial MDS/AML presented with normal karyotype and lacked typical AML-associated mutations.
Train_Line_7278 Of the 55 patients with chromosome 5 aberration [either isolated (n = 26, 47%) or part of a CK (n = 29, 53%)], 47% (26/55) had TP53 mutation compared with only 1.5% (4/263) in the patients without 5q aberration (P < 0.001).
Train_Line_7279 The section on statistical analyses is provided in supplemental Methods (available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Train_Line_7280 The prognostic relevance of FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutations (at codons D835 and I836) remains controversial.
Train_Line_7281 BCOR mRNA levels were quantified in triplicate by SYBR Green real-time PCR using the Light Cycler 480 system (Qiagen).
Train_Line_7282 The JAK family comprises 4 kinases (JAK1, 2, and 3 and TYK2) that attach to cytokine receptor cytosolic domains.
Train_Line_7283 Depending on the type of mutation, the mutant proteins retain varying amounts of the negatively charged amino acids of nonmutant calreticulin.
Train_Line_7284 This was also true for monosomal karyotype, defined as the karyotype of patients who had >=2 autosomal monosomies or 1 monosomy in combination with other structural abnormalities.
Train_Line_7285 Four hundred and sixty-six adult patients who were diagnosed as having de novo MDS according to the FAB classification at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and had cryopreserved bone marrow cells for study were recruited for gene mutation analyses.
Train_Line_7286 Since the initial report on SF3B1 mutations in MDS, other groups have confirmed the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations in MDS patients and the association of the mutations with the presence of ring sideroblasts (RSs).
Train_Line_7287 In the same line, JAK2V617F has been recently described to interact with and phosphorylate the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 with a much greater affinity than wild-type JAK2.
Train_Line_7288 In particular, 96 AML patients belonged to the category of "AML with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities" of WHO 2008, including t(8;21)(q22;q22) (n = 30), inv(16)(p13q22) (n = 40), t(15;17)(q22;21) (n = 10), t(11q23)/MLL (n = 13), t(6; 9)(p23;q24) (n = 2), and t(3;3)(q21;q26.2) (n = 1).
Train_Line_7289 Furthermore, novel potential target genes have been delineated based on the observation that they are located in critical regions of deletions or contained in amplicons, such as MYC in 8q24, ETS1 and FLI1 in 11q24, CDX2 in 13q12, and ETS2 and ERG in 21q22.
Train_Line_7290 Mouse Analysis.
Train_Line_7291 In another study including only MDS patients with ring sideroblasts, the presence of SF3B1 mutations was associated with better overall and leukemiafree survival in univariate analysis.
Train_Line_7292 Wang et al used a similar strategy and analyzed DNA samples from 91 CLL patients (88 exomes and 3 genomes).
Train_Line_7293 A unique gain-of-function mutation in the Janus kinase 2 gene (JAK2) is found in about three quarters of patients in whom these disease entities have been diagnosed.
Train_Line_7294 CpG island methylation has been infrequently assessed in patients with a MPD.
Train_Line_7295 An example of a salvage regimen is cytarabine (3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 3, 5, and 7) combined with daunorubicin (50 mg/m2) or idarubicin (10 mg/m2) on days 2, 4, and 6.
Train_Line_7296 Recently, mutations in Splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1) were discovered that appear to be not only specifically associated with MDS but even with the subtypes of MDS that show ring sideroblasts (RARS and RCMD-RS).
Train_Line_7297 Samples of whole bone marrow mononuclear cell-derived DNA from the 288 patients with MDS in this study were examined for mutations in 18 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (TET2, ASXL1, RUNX1, EZH2, JAK2, NRAS, TP53, ETV6, CBL, NPM1, IDH1, IDH2, KRAS, BRAF, PTEN, CDKN2A, GNAS, PTPN11), as reported previously.
Train_Line_7298 This results in increased production of 2-HG than would occur in usual physiologic conditions.
Train_Line_7299 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7300 DNA Extraction and RAS Mutations Detection.
Train_Line_7301 ASXL1 also associates with HP1a/CBX5, a component of the heterochromatin repressive complex.
Train_Line_7302 Patients with SRSF2 mutation had an inferior OS, an impact that might be related to the predominant occurrence of the mutation in older patients.
Train_Line_7303 Imatinib forms an H-bond with T670 and this is lost on mutation.
Train_Line_7304 Several cytogenetic risk classifications have been proposed for elderly patients.
Train_Line_7305 Alexander E. Smith; Azim M. Mohamedali; Austin Kulasekararaj; ZiYi Lim; Joop Gaken; Nicholas C. Lea; Bartlomiej Przychodzen; Syed A. Mian; Erick E. Nasser; Claire Shooter; Nigel B. Westwood; Corinna Strupp; Norbert Gattermann; Jaroslaw P. Maciejewski; Ulrich Germing; Ghulam J. Mufti.
Train_Line_7306 Hence, epigenetic modification of SOCS3 represents a novel mechanism by which JAK/STAT signaling may become aberrant within MPD.
Train_Line_7307 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7308 Based on these results, a survival scoring system incorporated these 3 molecular markers and age into survival analysis was designed to better stratify CN-AML patients into different risk groups.
Train_Line_7309 The inclusion of the positive and negative controls in all runs suggested similar performance by the two approaches. All suspected mutations identified by the screening techniques were confirmed by sequence analysis either directly or after subcloning.
Train_Line_7310 We did not find heritable GATA2 coding variations in samples from another 8 families with multiple individuals with AML or in 27 families with multiple occurrences of lymphoid malignancies (11 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 5 with Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 7 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 1 with multiple myeloma).
Train_Line_7311 This was true also in patients with low or intermediate-1 IPSS risk.
Train_Line_7312 MPLWT and MPLW515L retroviral supernatants were able to reproducibly infect 40%-60% of Ba/F3 and 32D cells as assessed by flow cytometry. Balb/C donor mice were treated with 5-Florouracil (150 mg/kg) seven days prior to bone marrow harvest.
Train_Line_7313 AML patients carrying mutRAS benefit from higher cytarabine doses more than wtRAS patients. This seems to be the first example of an activating oncogene mutation favorably modifying response to higher drug doses in AML.
Train_Line_7314 The Fine and Gray test was used for cumulative incidence of AML.
Train_Line_7315 In one of these studies involving 163 patients, the drug was effective in more than 90% of the patients and median survival exceeded 17 years.
Train_Line_7316 According to the current European LeukemiaNet (ELN) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of AML, AMLs with normal karyotype are classified into two genetic categories based on their NPM1, FLT3-ITD and CEBPA mutation status: the ELN Favorable category is defined as mutated CEBPA and/or mutated NPM1 without FLT3-IT; all remaining cases (ie, those with wild-type CEBPA, and wild-type NPM1 with or without FLT3-ITD or mutated NPM1 with FLT3-ITD) form the ELN Intermediate-I category.
Train_Line_7317 In the presence of a genetic lesion, downregulation of SETD2 contributed to both initiation and progression during leukemia development by promoting the self-renewal potential of leukemia stem cells.
Train_Line_7318 Follow-up samples were available for 35 of these 193 patients (median follow-up, 226 days) and examined in addition to the first sample.
Train_Line_7319 In addition, the vast majority of patients with SF3B1 mutation have a good clinical outcome with a low propensity to AML transformation.
Train_Line_7320 The action of imatinib in the treatment of GIST has been extensively evaluated and it is currently the first line treatment for metastatic disease and in an adjuvant setting for prevention of relapse of poor prognosis GIST following surgical resection (reviewed [43,44]).
Train_Line_7321 Myeloid sarcoma may present de novo preceding AML, concurrently with AML, or as blastic transformation of MDS, MPN, or MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_7322 Mutation of Pro95 may reduce the RNA binding affinity of SRSF2 protein and thus affects the function of SRSF2.
Train_Line_7323 Background.
Train_Line_7324 ANALYSIS OF DNMT3A MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_7325 TET2 was named based on the identification that the founding TET member, TET1 (located on chromosome 10q22) as a translocation member with MLL1 on chromosome 11q23 in a rare t(10;11)(q22;q23).
Train_Line_7326 This has not been well elucidated to date, and there is a pressing need for detailed genomic profiling of large MPN patient cohorts and clinical trial cohorts to identify novel factors which predict outcome, risk of leukemic transformation, and therapeutic response in the different MPNs.
Train_Line_7327 The latter association is especially intriguing because chromatin and histone modifications have been shown to play a significant role in pre-mRNA splicing.
Train_Line_7328 Clinical Characteristics and Treatment.
Train_Line_7329 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7330 Whereas some studies reported a negative impact in selected subgroups, others suggest that outcome of patients with myeloid sarcoma after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic HSCT may not be inferior.
Train_Line_7331 Some centers start as soon as a patient is identified to be a potential HSCT candidate.
Train_Line_7332 Omar Abdel-Wahab; Ross L. Levine.
Train_Line_7333 To investigate whether CALR mutations are present in other myeloid neoplasms, we screened 254 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 45 with chronic myeloid leukemia, 73 with the myelodysplastic syndrome, 64 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 24 with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) for mutations in CALR exon 9.
Train_Line_7334 Interestingly, 90% (27/30) of cases with TP53 mutation had abnormality involving chromosome 5 [including unique patient number 6 (UPN6) with 5q deletion detected on FISH].
Train_Line_7335 A recent large international study confirmed the prognostic relevance of distinguishing ET from pre-fibrotic PMF.
Train_Line_7336 However, patients with CN-AML and mutated DNMT3A (27.2%) had a shorter OS (median OS in mutated v wild-type patients 1.73 v 5.36 years; HR = 1.73; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.46; P = .003; Fig 2A) and lower CR rate (69% v 82%; P = .023) compared with DNMT3A wild-type patients in univariate analysis.
Train_Line_7337 KEY POINTS.
Train_Line_7338 Immunophenotyping using multiparameter (commonly at least 3- to 4-color) flow cytometry is used to determine lineage involvement of a newly diagnosed acute leukemia (Table 2).
Train_Line_7339 The past decade has seen major advances in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic lesions that govern the pathophysiology of MDS (Bejar & Ebert, 2010).
Train_Line_7340 FLT3 is activated following binding of FLT3 ligand, leading to the activation of downstream signaling pathways including Stat5, RAS, and PI3 kinase.
Train_Line_7341 Mutational Complementation Groups.
Train_Line_7342 Germline BCOR mutations are responsible for the OFCD syndrome, which is inherited in an X-linked pattern with presumed male lethality and is characterized by microphthalmia, dysmorphic appearance, dental abnormalities (radiculomegaly), hammer-toe deformity, and cardiac defects.
Train_Line_7343 U2AF1 mutation is more prevalent in younger MDS patients and associated with inferior outcomes although it is stable during the clinical course.
Train_Line_7344 Detection of MPO (if present in >=3% of blasts) indicates myeloid differentiation, but its absence does not exclude a myeloid lineage because early myeloblasts and monoblasts may lack MPO.
Train_Line_7345 In strictly WHO-defined ET, a recent study has revealed that prognosis is even better than previously assumed.
Train_Line_7346 Assessment of ASXL1 mutational status should be included in the genetic work-up of patients with MDS, and the mutation status might be integrated in molecular scoring systems in the future.
Train_Line_7347 The decision to perform HSCT in patients with MDS can be challenging, and our findings suggest that analysis of mutations can aid such decisions.
Train_Line_7348 Our finding, that SH2B3 PH domain mutations show a mild loss of function, support this hypothesis and furthermore, raise the possibility that SH2B3 mutations in haematopoietic malignancies might often be associated with additional mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway.
Train_Line_7349 293T and Plat-E cells were transfected with either BioT (Bioland Scientific, Paramount, CA, USA) or ProFection Mammalian Transfection System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA; 293T for viral production) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Train_Line_7350 The prevalence of homozygous JAK2V617F mutation in RARS-T suggests that this entity is biologically distinct from essential thrombocythemia.
Train_Line_7351 We analyzed clinical and molecular parameters in a cohort of 288 patients with lower-risk IPSS MDS, validated the MD Anderson LR-PSS (designed to more finely stratify IPSS low- and intermediate-1-risk patients on the basis of clinical features), and demonstrated the value of integrating additional genetic information into this calculation.
Train_Line_7352 Germline DDX41 defects strongly predispose to somatic DDX41 mutations.
Train_Line_7353 In multivariable analyses, however, t-AML appears to remain an independent adverse prognostic factor.
Train_Line_7354 6. Response criteria and survival outcomes.
Train_Line_7355 Although SOCS3 inhibits wild type JAK2 and targets it for degradation, it has no such effect on mutant JAK2 and SOCS3 may even enhance the proliferative effect of the mutant JAK2 V617F protein.
Train_Line_7356 The ASXL1 protein belongs to protein complexes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
Train_Line_7357 In contrast, SH2B3 W217A, a point mutation in the SH2B3 PH domain generated by Tong et al(2005) caused mild loss of SH2B3 function on 32D/EPOR cell growth (Tong et al 2005; McMullin et al 2011).
Train_Line_7358 Diagnosis of PV and ET is currently according to WHO criteria and based on a composite assessment of clinical and laboratory features (Table II).
Train_Line_7359 The same were also true if the analyses were restricted to IDH2 mutation (Supporting Information Table S2).
Train_Line_7360 Overall survival (OS) end points, measured from date of diagnosis, were deceased (failure) and alive at last contact (censored).
Train_Line_7361 Paired remission DNA (i.e., DNA from patients who had a complete remission after induction chemotherapy) was available from 241 of the 398 participants in the test cohort and from 65 of the 104 in the validation cohort.
Train_Line_7362 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show a close association of SRSF2 mutation with RUNX1, IDH2, and ASXL1 mutations in MDS and the stability of this mutation during the clinical follow-ups.
Train_Line_7363 Live tumour cells persist in patients treated with imatinib, and patients rapidly relapse on drug withdrawal.
Train_Line_7364 Granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GMPs) are still formed in preleukemic mice showing that p30 is sufficient to induce commitment of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) toward GMPs.
Train_Line_7365 This phenotype corresponds to a weak JAK2V617F expression, supporting the hypothesis that phenotypic heterogeneity of the JAK2V617F-induced diseases might be because of the intensity of JAK2 signaling, especially to the number of JAK2V617F copies.
Train_Line_7366 For example, EZH2 mutations were strongly associated with a poor prognosis (median survival, 0.81 years; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.46 years; Data Supplement) in patients assigned to category 2 or 3 but were not tightly linked to clinical features.
Train_Line_7367 JAK2 genotyping.
Train_Line_7368 The implication of BCOR mutations in AML is supported by their disruptive character: nonsense or conserved splice-site mutations and out-of-frame insertions/deletions introducing premature stop codons, which are scattered throughout the whole coding sequence.
Train_Line_7369 The log-rank test was used to assess potential differences in outcome between subgroups.
Train_Line_7370 Leukocytosis has also been associated with leukemic and JAK2V617F allele burden with fibrotic transformation in PV.
Train_Line_7371 UT7 cells were grown in IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and GMCSF (1 ng/mL). 32D cells, Ba/F3 cells, and murine bone marrow cells were transduced with viral supernatant, and UT7 cells were transduced by electroporation (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States). Cells were then selected in G418 (1mg/mL).
Train_Line_7372 Among 193 patients with MDS, 40 patients (20.7%) had mutations in ASXL1 exon 12.
Train_Line_7373 The observed genotype-phenotype relationships suggest that the gain-of-function mutations in PTPN11 identified in JMML and Noonan syndrome have distinct effects.
Train_Line_7374 Background.
Train_Line_7375 About 50 ng of DNA was used for each PCR reaction.
Train_Line_7376 A few studies have already suggested that incorporation of somatic mutations into prognostic scoring systems can improve prognostication of MDS.
Train_Line_7377 Shortly after the discovery of the enzymatic function of the TET family, 2 studies noted that patients with myeloid malignancies with mutations in TET2 had decreased global levels of 5hmC.
Train_Line_7378 Cases presenting with pronounced multilineage dysplasia may be referred to as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, ringed sideroblastosis and thrombocytosis (RCMD- RS-T) as recently proposed.
Train_Line_7379 In conclusion, IDH mutation is a useful biomarker for risk stratification of patients with lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_7380 To investigate the role of ASXL1 mutation in disease progression, sequential analyses of the gene mutation were performed in 305 samples from 112 patients, including 32 patients with ASXL1 mutation at diagnosis and 80 patients without the mutation.
Train_Line_7381 BM cells were harvested directly or after 1 to 3 days of unstimulated culture, and the metaphase chromosomes were banded by the G-banding method as described previously.
Train_Line_7382 This alteration was found in the majority of patients who we classified as mutated for ASXL1.
Train_Line_7383 Mutations were identified in 71% of all samples, and mutations associated with a poor prognosis were enriched in the highest-risk LR-PSS category.
Train_Line_7384 The prognostic impact of mutations of spliceosome genes in MDS patients is still controversial.
Train_Line_7385 ASXL3 expression and functions remain to be determined.
Train_Line_7386 C/EBPalpha promoter methylation was present in six of 10 cases with undetectable C/EBPalpha mRNA expression and was associated with activating Notch1 mutations and aberrant T-cell marker expression.
Train_Line_7387 By binding to phosphorylated tyrosines on the cytokine receptors and JAK2, the SH2B3 SH2 domain is associated with attenuation of downstream signalling in response to cytokine stimulation.
Train_Line_7388 Crystal structure analysis of KIT has shown that in the absence of ligand the JMD folds back into the active site of the kinase (Figure 2).
Train_Line_7389 In addition, the type of mutated gene had an independent effect on survival.
Train_Line_7390 There was no significant association of IDH mutations with any special karyotype.
Train_Line_7391 In another study focused on pediatric AML patients, the patients older than or equal to 3 years and less than 10 years of age had higher frequency of WT1 mutations than those younger than 3 years or those 10 years or older.
Train_Line_7392 MDS patients with RAEB1/RAEB2 had a significantly higher incidence of ASXL1 mutation than those with other subtypes (25% vs 10.7%, P<0.001, Table 1).
Train_Line_7393 To study the functional effects of mutated CALR, we cloned the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the nonmutated CALR and the type 1 mutation (52-bp deletion) into a retroviral expression vector based on the murine stem-cell virus, with an internal ribosome entry site and green fluorescent protein (GFP).
Train_Line_7394 JAK2 exon 12 mutations are rare in ET or PMF.
Train_Line_7395 Altogether, less than 10% of our patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis did not have a somatic mutation of JAK2, MPL, or CALR.
Train_Line_7396 All patients with mutated CALR had nonmutated JAK2 and MPL.
Train_Line_7397 The patients with DNMT3A mutations had a trend of poorer OS than those without (P = 0.060).
Train_Line_7398 Precipitated proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer, eluted with SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis.
Train_Line_7399 With PBMCs from the healthy twin as a germline and normal tissue control, we revealed an intrachromosomal translocation that gave rise to the MLL-NRIP3 fusion gene in the twin with leukemia (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).
Train_Line_7400 Bisulphite-modified DNA (0.5 mug) from purified granulocytes and/or mononuclear cells was PCR-amplified in duplicate in a 25 muL reaction volume containing 1X SYBR Green mix (Stratagene), 0.6 muM of each primer and 0.03 muM ROX reference dye (Stratagene).
Train_Line_7401 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7402 Instead, SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 mutations occurred in all different subtypes of MDS and were not associated with a specific IPSS risk profile or cytogenetic aberration.
Train_Line_7403 U2AF1 mutations were studied sequentially in 421 samples from 142 patients, including 15 patients with U2AF1 mutation and 127 patients without U2AF1 mutation at diagnosis.
Train_Line_7404 Deregulation of C/EBPalpha plays a role in a number of hematologic malignancies, where C/EBPalpha has been demonstrated to be mutated, involved in chromosomal translocations, or suppressed both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level, resulting in different mechanisms of oncogenic events (Fig 2).
Train_Line_7405 The MPLW515L mutation was generated using sitedirected mutagenesis (Quickchange-XL, Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States) and confirmed by full-length DNA sequencing. 293T cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Train_Line_7406 Grade 2-3 according to the European classification: diffuse, often coarse fiber network with no evidence of collagenization (negative trichrome stain) or diffuse, coarse fiber network with areas of collagenization (positive trichrome stain). Grade 3-4 according to the standard classification: diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections, occasionally with only focal bundles of collagen and/or focal osteosclerosis or diffuse and dense increase in reticulin with extensive intersections with coarse bundles of collagen, often associated with significant osteosclerosis.
Train_Line_7407 TABLE II. Spliceosome Mutation Profile in 226 Patients with CMML.
Train_Line_7408 Moreover, corresponding deletions on 5q35.3 present in 6% of cases led to haploinsufficient DDX41 expression.
Train_Line_7409 Truncating BCOR mutations were significantly more frequent in RUNX1-mut and DNMT3A-mut MDS patients in the global cohort.
Train_Line_7410 However, similar finding was also reported by other groups.
Train_Line_7411 The report concerning the stability of U2AF1 mutation during the disease evolution of MDS is scanty.
Train_Line_7412 In fact, SRSF2 mutations have been associated with a higher number of mutations of other genes in comparison to other spliceosomal mutations.
Train_Line_7413 The 160 CN-AML patients were characterized extensively for known gene mutations associated with the normal karyotype.
Train_Line_7414 The JAK2V617F mutation was present in 11 patients (48%) and was associated with significantly higher erythrocyte and white blood cell counts (p=0.009 and 0.011, respectively).
Train_Line_7415 We designed and validated 28 primer pairs covering the coding sequences and splice sites of all 23 exons for DNMT3A.
Train_Line_7416 The CMD-WG investigators reasoned that the peculiar phenotype of RARS could make easier the identification of recurrently mutated genes and used massively parallel sequencing technology to this purpose.
Train_Line_7417 However, during progression of the disease, JAK2V617F was outcompeted by the CBL mutant, suggesting that the 2 mutations had occurred in 2 different cells.
Train_Line_7418 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Train_Line_7419 BCOR normalized transcript levels did not differ with respect to gender (supplemental Figure 2).
Train_Line_7420 Because germline mutations were predominantly out-of-frame insertions and they coincided with somatic DDX41 mutations suggested that defects of this gene may result in a loss of function.
Train_Line_7421 Table 3. Test/procedures in the initial work-up of a patient with AML.
Train_Line_7422 This finding of the t(9;22) translocation leading to a fusion protein between Abelson leukemia virus proto-oncogene ABL1 and breakpoint cluster region BCR, and the subsequent extraordinary success of the small molecule inhibitor imatinib, has been arguably one of the most important discoveries in modern oncology.
Train_Line_7423 Wild-type and mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels when transiently expressed in HEK293 fibroblasts (Fig. 2a) and when induced to express from a 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4HT)-responsive dual vector lentivirus system in stably transduced HL-60 promyelocytes (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and they appropriately localized to the nucleus (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3b).
Train_Line_7424 Outcomes.
Train_Line_7425 From a practical point of view, the different effects of mutated genes might be incorporated into existing prognostic scoring systems for primary myelofibrosis and essential thrombocythemia and might also guide therapeutic decision making.
Train_Line_7426 The three analyzed spliceosomal gene mutations did not have any specific correlation with age, gender, ANC, AMC, PB, or BM blasts, WHO histological subcategories (CMML-1 vs. CMML-2) or specific karyotypic abnormalities.
Train_Line_7427 The clonal hierarchies for Patients H_0191 and H_0296 are shown in Figure 3B.
Train_Line_7428 This lack of associations was also true if the analyses were performed in the 368 MDS patients based on the WHO classification (Supporting Information Table I).
Train_Line_7429 The dose of hydroxyurea is titrated to keep platelet count in the normal range and leukocyte count >2 x 109 /L.
Train_Line_7430 FLT3 is expressed on the leukemic cells of 70-100% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_7431 Splice gene mutations were mostly mutually exclusive (91 of 95, 97%; P < .001), with concomitant mutations affecting 2 splice genes detected in only 4 patients.
Train_Line_7432 Deep sequencing may allow the simultaneous detection of both somatic gene mutations and copy number changes, the cytogenetic abnormalities typical of MDS, in a single assay.
Train_Line_7433 The presence of IDH2R140Q did not affect the overall (P = 0.54) or leukemia-free (P = 0.81) survival.
Train_Line_7434 Polycythemia Vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively.
Train_Line_7435 DNMT3A mutations were expressed in the majority of cells in all tested mutant samples regardless of blast counts, suggesting that DNMT3A mutations occur early in the course of MDS.
Train_Line_7436 Mutations in SF3B1 and SRSF2 were the most prevalent aberrations in MDS patients.
Train_Line_7437 The BCOR V1616fs mutation was identified in 7317 of 24600 reads (29.7%), which corresponds to an estimated totality of 59.4% of cells carrying this mutation in the bulk of BM cells.
Train_Line_7438 In multivariable analysis including clinical variables, complex karyotype status, and candidate genes, mutations in TP53 (HR, 4.22; P + .001) and TET2 (HR, 1.68; P = .037) were each independently associated with shorter OS.
Train_Line_7439 The mutant allele burden can be estimated using various approaches: i) by means of allele-specific quantitative PCR [e.g., the procedure employed for estimating the proportion of JAK2 (V617F)-mutant alleles in granulocytes from a patient with polycythemia vera]; or ii) more directly by assessing variant and wild-type reads using next-generation sequencing.
Train_Line_7440 IDH1 and IDH2 catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to a-ketoglutarate.
Train_Line_7441 Two patients with melanoma harbouring L576-mutated KIT were successfully treated with dasatinib, which may have been due to its activity on SFK as well as or instead of KIT.
Train_Line_7442 Further work to understand (1) the combined phenotype of mice with Tet2 loss and the presence of co-occurring genetic alterations and (2) the genetic targets of Tet2 loss which result in increased HSC self-renewal alone and in combination with other genetic events may improve our understanding of the pathogenesis and therapy of TET2 mutant AML.
Train_Line_7443 Analyses were performed using JMP10 (SAS Inc.).
Train_Line_7444 The mutation rates of other genes between U2AF1-mutated and U2AF1-wild patients did not differ significantly, with a possible exception of JAK2 mutation (10.5% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.013, Table II) despite the small number of JAK2-mutated patients.
Train_Line_7445 Furthermore, we show that the prognostic impact of SRSF2 and ZRSR2 mutations depends on the mutation status of TET2, the gene most commonly mutated in MDS.
Train_Line_7446 We then separated the patients in our cohort into two groups: patients with mutations in DNMT3A or NPM1 or with MLL translocations and patients with wild-type DNMT3A and NPM1 and no MLL translocations.
Train_Line_7447 EZH2.
Train_Line_7448 Furthermore, TET2 mutations are not linked to the 46/1 JAK2V617F mutation predisposition genotype, the only characterized genetic background associated with myeloid disease.
Train_Line_7449 Fig 1. Physiological function of CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha). (A) Major sites of tissue expression of C/EBPalpha include the liver, the hematopoietic system, white adipose tissue, and the lung. Accordingly, mice with targeted disruption of C/EBPalpha (C/EBPalpha-knockout mice) display perinatal hypoglycemia, absence of granulocytes, lack of white adipose tissue, and hyperproliferation of interstitial lung tissue. Modified from Zhang et al, Yang et al and Flodby et al (with permission). (B) Within the hematopoietic system, C/EBPalpha is expressed at lower levels in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and its expression increases progressively during granulocytic differentiation via common myeloid progenitor cells (CMP) and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GMP). C/EBPalpha is not detectable in megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitors (MEP), common lymphoid progenitors (CLP), or more mature lymphoid cells. Modified from Akashi et al with permission. (C) The C/EBPalpha mRNA is comprised of a cap sequence and 5J untranslated region (UTR), the C/EBPalpha coding sequence derived from a single exon, and the 3J UTR, which is followed by the poly A sequence (upper panel). The letters A, B1, B2, C, and D designate five ATG sites of translational start sites which are highly conserved across the six different species depicted with the exception of the A site, which is missing in the human species (middle panel). Translation from all sites except D produce a specific C/EBPalpha isoform that can be detected by Western blotting, and omission of each site (ie, -A) leads to the loss of the specific isoform. The major C/EBPalpha isoforms are produced from the B1 and C sites and are 42 kD and 30 kD in size. From Calkhoven et al with permission.

Train_Line_7451 Indeed, the frequency of mutations in epigenetic modifiers correlates with increasing age of AML patients.
Train_Line_7452 Transformative events either leading towards a blast phase MPN or leukemogenesis do not seem to be explained by the individual genetic alterations which characterize the disease.
Train_Line_7453 It is still unknown whether RAS mutations promote the initiation or the progression of myeloid malignancies to acute leukemia.
Train_Line_7454 Mutations in ASXL1 result in global decrease of histone 3 lysine 27 methylation, a histone marker associated with repression of transcription.
Train_Line_7455 Mutations in SRSF2 also have been reported in MDS patients, but studies concerning the clinical correlations of the mutations are limited.
Train_Line_7456 Sequence analysis of candidate genes.
Train_Line_7457 Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_7458 While SF3B1-mut patients were likely to present with RSs and reduced hemoglobin levels leading to a higher transfusion dependence rate, patients harboring SRSF2 mutations clustered in RAEB-1 and RAEB-2 subtypes and had pronounced thrombocytopenias.
Train_Line_7459 In addition, co-occurrence of TET2 and SRSF2 mutation is typically found in CMML.
Train_Line_7460 As an example, in CBF AML low-level PCR-positivity can be detected in patients even in long-term remission. Normalizing to 104 copies of ABL1 in accordance with standardized criteria, transcript levels below 12 to 10 copies appear to be predictive for long-term remission.
Train_Line_7461 Currently known IDH mutations involve exon 4 and affect three specific arginine residues: R132 (IDH1), R172 (IDH2) and R140 (IDH2).
Train_Line_7462 Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that MYC may be among key targets repressed by wild-type GATA2 but not by p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_7463 Calreticulin, another RNA binding protein, has been demonstrated to be upregulated and to inhibit C/EBPalpha translation in AML subtypes with CBFB-SMMHC and AML1-MDS-EVI1 translocations.
Train_Line_7464 This molecular evolution was also reflected by a progression in the morphological disease features in sequential bone marrow biopsies, especially an increase in megakaryopoiesis.
Train_Line_7465 U2AF1 mutation was mutually exclusive from SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_7466 Only 20% of the TET2-mutated patients showed loss of heterozygosity at the TET2 locus.
Train_Line_7467 The statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL, USA).
Train_Line_7468 The genomic coordinates and sequences of all the primers used in this study are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Train_Line_7469 Each one of the primer pairs was labeled with appropriate fluorescence.
Train_Line_7470 In our study on prognostic factors in MDS, the life expectancy of RARS patients 70 years or older was not significantly different from that of the general reference population.
Train_Line_7471 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7472 We report here that individuals with Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) have germline mutations in PTPN11 and that somatic mutations in PTPN11 account for 34% of non-syndromic JMML.
Train_Line_7473 Such mutations had been long been known to be involved in AML (reviewed in detail by Shih et al.), particularly MLL translocations, which harbor a poor prognosis.
Train_Line_7474 Diagnosis of PV and ET is currently according to WHO criteria and based on a composite assessment of clinical and laboratory features (Table II).
Train_Line_7475 A recent trial found that patients randomized to posaconazole had fewer invasive fungal infections than patients randomized to either fluconazole or itraconazole according to institutional practice.
Train_Line_7476 Indeed, patients with DNMT3A and SF3B1 mutations had a longer median survival than patients with DNMT3A mutations alone (median, 4.16 years [95% CI, 2.11 to 6.85] v 1.45 years [95% CI, 0.59 to 2.74 years]; P = .035) as shown in the Data Supplement.

Kaplan-Meier curves of OS stratified by SRSF2 mutation for all patients (A), lower and higher risk IPSS subgroups (B-C), lower and higher risk WHO subgroups (D-E), lower and higher risk FAB subgroups (F-G), CMML patients (H), and the patients older than 50 years (I).
Train_Line_7478 The mechanisms of KIT activation by exon 11 and 17 mutations are discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.4 in the context of GIST and haematological malignancies, respectively.

Train_Line_7480 The 5-group cytogenetic risk classification reported in Table 2 was recently found to predict the outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in MDS patients.
Train_Line_7481 The bone marrow transplant model of MPLW515L-mediated myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) exhibits certain features of human MF, including extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly, and megakaryocytic proliferation.
Train_Line_7482 Tumor volumes were measured in two dimensions (length and width) using a dial caliper and were calculated using the following formula: tumor volume = (length x width2) x 0.5.
Train_Line_7483 CBL mutations, initially discovered in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, have been found in 3% of patients with PMF.
Train_Line_7484 In the absence of JAK2V617F, the possibility of CML is readily addressed by BCR-ABL1 mutation screening but it is also to be noted that megakaryocytes in CML (small and hypolobulated) are easily distinguished from those of ET.
Train_Line_7485 Comparison of cytological BM reports revealed a trend for a higher rate of dysgranulopoiesis in BCOR-mut patients (P = .06, Table 3).
Train_Line_7486 Among patients with mutated RAS, those in the HDAC group tended to have a better survival than patients in the LDAC group, whereas among patients with wild-type RAS, there was no substantial benefit from receiving HDAC.
Train_Line_7487 During the natural course of the disease, patients with MDS are at high risk of progressing to AML.
Train_Line_7488 Eighteen of 25 SRSF2-mut patients were classified according to the WHO classification as refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB-1) or RAEB-2 (72% vs 42% in SRSF2-wt patients; P = .004).
Train_Line_7489 During the past decade, there have been important advances in the molecular characterization of a large group of AML patients who, at cytogenetical resolution, demonstrate a normal karyotype (CN-AML).
Train_Line_7490 In this study, most patients received palliative treatment and/or supportive care and there was no difference in the treatment between the patients with and without U2AF1 mutation (data not shown), so the inferior outcomes in the patients with U2AF1 mutation might not be explained by the difference in treatments.
Train_Line_7491 Brcc3 knockdown also resulted in moderate differentiation block (Figure 3), which was confirmed by flow cytometry analyses showing increased expression of precursor marker c-Kit and reduced expression of differentiation marker Gr-1 with Brcc3 knockdown (Online Supplementary Figure S5).
Train_Line_7492 Sequential studies during clinical courses were performed on 173 samples from 66 patients.
Train_Line_7493 BRCC3 mutations were more common in MDS and MDS/MPN compared to primary AML and MPN, and were cytogenetically associated with -Y abnormality.
Train_Line_7494 Screening of NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, IDH1/2, and RUNX1 mutations and analysis for MLL-PTD was performed as described previously.
Train_Line_7495 Functional Analysis of MPLW515L and Wild-Type MPL.
Train_Line_7496 Furthermore, several classes of epigenetic modifiers have also been identified, in MPN patients, revealing a requirement for mutations in other pathways to cooperate with JAK-STAT pathway mutations in MPN pathogenesis.
Train_Line_7497 This suggests that DNMT3A mutations are very early genetic events in MDS, and may confer a clonal advantage to cells bearing a mutation in this gene.
Train_Line_7498 Table 2. Details of IDH1/2 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia patients with a previous history of myelodysplastic syndromes.
Train_Line_7499 In multivariate analysis, including age, IPSS risk groups, transfusion dependence, mutation status for ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53, CBL, and the genotypes DNMT3A-mut /SF3B1-wt, SRSF2-mut/TET2-wt, and ZRSR2-mut/TET2-wt, the genotype ZRSR2-mut/TET2-wt was found to be an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for OS (HR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.7; P = .006) and ZRSR2-mut/TET2-wt independently associated with a higher AML transformation rate (HR = 3.6; 95% CI, 2-4.2; P = .026; Table 3).
Train_Line_7500 Therefore, NPM1-mutated AML and CEBPA-mutated AML have already been included as provisional entities in the 2008 WHO classification.
Train_Line_7501 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal disorder of hematopoiesis characterized by the accumulation of immature myeloid cells accompanied by impaired normal hematopoiesis.
Train_Line_7502 On the basis of cytogenetic classification alone, 63% of the patients in the ECOG E1900 cohort were categorized as having an intermediate-risk AML profile (3-year rate of overall survival, 36%), whereas 19% of the patients were classified as having a favorable-risk profile (3-year rate of overall survival, 58%) and 18% as having an unfavorable-risk profile (3-year rate of overall survival, 11%) (Fig. 5A).
Train_Line_7503 In MDS and PMF, SRSF2 mutations are relatively common (~15-20%) and are associated with shortened OS and LFS.
Train_Line_7504 Thr354 and Thr355 are the first two of five consecutive threonine residues in a highly conserved zinc finger 2 (ZF2) domain of GATA2 (Supplementary Fig. 1b), which is involved in DNA binding, heterodimerization and interaction with transcription factor PU.1 (refs. 4,5).
Train_Line_7505 Exon 9 mutations, most commonly an AY insertion, occur in about 10% of GIST cases and may act by a similar mechanism.
Train_Line_7506 Genome-wide gene expression data from 25 wild-type and five ASXL1 mutated samples from patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia were used to assess differential gene expression.
Train_Line_7507 Our novel finding of BCOR mutations in AML is in agreement with other studies pointing to a role of BCOR in leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_7508 MDS patients, based either on the FAB or 2008 WHO classification, had a significantly shorter OS if they harbored ASXL1 mutation than those who did not (median, 18.5 vs 42.4 months, P<0.001; and 21 vs 69.9 months, P<0.001, respectively; Figure 1).
Train_Line_7509 Imatinib in treatment of GIST.
Train_Line_7510 Furthermore, 19 of 131 (15%) cases analyzed by array CGH on DNA sequence analysis exhibited homozygous TP53 mutation that are probably caused by UPD(17p) considering the frequency of UPD(17p) found by SNP array analysis.
Train_Line_7511 It has been proposed that this approach could lead to tumour de-bulking in advanced disease allowing subsequent successful surgery.
Train_Line_7512 Regarding specific recurrent chromosomal changes, patients with isolated 220/20q had a significant higher frequency of U2AF1 mutation than others (Supporting Information Table III), a finding also identified by others.
Train_Line_7513 Recurrent somatic mutation of SRSF2, one of the RNA splicing machinery genes, has been identified in a substantial proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Train_Line_7514 Although some patients primarily suffer from the consequences of cytopenia, a significant number of patients experience progression to AML in the clinical course.
Train_Line_7515 Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_7516 Functional analyses documented that the two most common mutations in PTPN11 associated with JMML caused a gain of function.
Train_Line_7517 Data for % relative mutation abundance (RMA) refers to the same mutation(s) across different tissues for any 1 patient.
Train_Line_7518 Overall, promoter methylation of C/EBPalpha and loss of its expression appears to be one of the most common genetic events in non-small-cell lung cancer and further corroborate that C/EBPalpha is indeed a tumor suppressor in non-small-cell lung cancer.
Train_Line_7519 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_7520 SH2B3 mutants and expression vectors.
Train_Line_7521 Conversely, our finding that approximately 50% of BCOR-mutated patients harbored mutations of the DNMT3A gene suggests that these 2 mutations may cooperate to induce AML, possibly acting through interference with epigenetic mechanisms.
Train_Line_7522 ShRNA knockdown and colony formation assay of LSK cells.
Train_Line_7523 Mutations of >= one of these genes were found in nearly one half of patients in this cohort.
Train_Line_7524 The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis: LNK/SH2B3, JAK2, phospho-ERK (Tyr 204), ERK, STAT5 and CBL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), phospho-STAT5A/B (Y694/699; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA); V5 (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA) and b actin/ACTB (Sigma).
Train_Line_7525 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7526 ASXL1 mutation is found in a substantial proportion (11-18.5%) of WHO-defined MDS patients and is correlated with unfavorable outcome.
Train_Line_7527 This mild effect of JAK2V617F on HSC biology is also observed in mouse models.
Train_Line_7528 Following this clue, we speculate that Pro95 is essential for SRSF2 binding to its target RNAs.
Train_Line_7529 To further clarify this issue we assessed the V617F status of 23 patients from a large cohort of 57 patients with well-documented RARS-T by allele-specific PCR for JAK2V617F genotyping.
Train_Line_7530 Specifically, a majority of these patients with mutated SETD2 (86.7%, 13 out of 15) had one additional major genetic aberration.
Train_Line_7531 Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to plot survival curves, and log-rank tests were used to calculate the difference of overall survival (OS) and time-to-leukemia transformation (TTL) between groups.
Train_Line_7532 The occurrence of mutations in PTPN11 exclusively in advanced MDS, which are characterized by a high incidence of evolution to AML and short duration of survival, and in cases of MDS-related AML, suggest that these defects may represent lesions driving progression of MDS to AML.
Train_Line_7533 Although mutations in ASXL1, RUNX1, TP53, and EZH2 each carried prognostic information independent of the LR-PSS, only EZH2 mutations remained as significant independent predictors of poor outcome in a final model obtained from stepwise Cox regression analysis of patients stratified by the LR-PSS and the mutation status of 14 other genes.
Train_Line_7534 Five of these patients (UPCs 750, 783, 1161, 1288, and 2545) had single mutations, and the 2 remaining patients (UPCs 2222 and 2719) had multiple mutations where 1 was above 25% RMA.
Train_Line_7535 To determine the role of SETD2 in disease initiation, we used several established pre-leukemia knock-in mouse models, including the Mll-Af9 (also called Mllt3), Mll-PTD (partial tandem duplication) and Aml1-Eto, in which additional mutations are required to develop fullblown AML.
Train_Line_7536 We also evaluated the BCOR mRNA levels from 8 BCOR-mut patients, 27 BCOR-wt patients, and 20 non-MDS controls.
Train_Line_7537 When evaluating thrombocytosis, the detection of JAK2V617F confirms the presence of an underlying MPN but its absence does not rule out the possibility since up to 40% of patients with ET might be JAK2V617F-negative.
Train_Line_7538 Quantification of samples was performed using the Delata Ct methods, using the average of U937 cell line Delta Ct as a calibrator.
Train_Line_7539 CYTOGENETIC ANALYSIS AND MUTATION ANALYSIS OF ASXL1.
Train_Line_7540 Approximate proportion of patients with MDS carrying the mutant gene reported in studies published so far.
Train_Line_7541 All patients without SRSF2 mutation remained germ line of the gene during clinical follow-ups, whereas all SRSF2-mutated patients retained their original mutations.
Train_Line_7542 There is no hard data that implicates hydroxyurea or busulfan as being leukemogenic in PV or ET.
Train_Line_7543 The following primers were used for amplification of the genomic region that spans wild-type R140 and R172 of IDH2 (exon 4) using PCR: 5`GGGGTTCAAATTCTGGTTGA and 5`CTAGGCGAGGAGCTCCAGT.
Train_Line_7544 Electromobility shift assay (EMSA) and EMSA-protein blot.
Train_Line_7545 When we measured the proliferation of cells in the absence of interleukin-3, only the CALR type 1 mutation showed a significant accumulation of cells (Fig. 5B).
Train_Line_7546 Although the majority of SF3B1-mutated RARS patients have a fully dominant clone that is heterozygous for the mutation, their percentage of ring sideroblasts ranges considerably from less than 20% to more than 90%.
Train_Line_7547 Clinical associations.
Train_Line_7548 Germline mutation: A mutation that is inherited though a germ cell (oocyte or spermatozoon) at the time of conception, and is therefore present in all cells of a developed body.
Train_Line_7549 The presence of cells expressing the D816V KIT mutant in the blood of healthy individuals and in patients with indolent SM has been reported.
Train_Line_7550 Cohesin is a highly conserved 4-subunit ring structure that encircles sister chromatids during metaphase, allowing their cohesion, and also plays critical roles in transcriptional regulation and post-replicative DNA repair.
Train_Line_7551 In our series of 234 CK-AMLs, TP53 was deleted and/or mutated in 70% of cases, thus representing the most frequently known altered gene in this AML subgroup.
Train_Line_7552 In keeping with previous observations, the assessment of the mutant allele burden in RARS-T patients carrying concomitant mutations of SF3B1 and JAK2 showed higher values for SF3B1 mutants compared with JAK2 mutants.
Train_Line_7553 Graphs represent total number of colonies counted for three representative mice in each group, with two plates counted for each mouse.
Train_Line_7554 Only 45% of patients with mutated RAS experienced relapse.

Overall survival (OS) by intent-to-treat analysis for patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and mutated versus wild-type DNMT3A with related donors or without related donors. (A) OS in patients with mutated DNMT3A with related donors or without related donors. (B) OS in patients with wild-type DNMT3A with related donors or without related donors.
Train_Line_7556 Mutations in genes of the splicing machinery have been described recently in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
Train_Line_7557 Diagnosis.
Train_Line_7558 Median OS for FLT3-mutated CMML patients was 10.8 months versus 21.3 months for FLT3-nonmutated CMML patients (P = 0.12).
Train_Line_7559 The somatic nature of truncating BCOR mutations was confirmed whenever nontumor DNA was available (10 cases).
Train_Line_7560 Although the molecular pathophysiology of MDS is different from that of AML, some AML driver genes might behave as subclonal drivers in MDS and thereby drive leukemic transformation.
Train_Line_7561 Prolonged application of intrathecal therapy does not appear to be justified, given that such therapy carries the risk of complications (eg, leukencephalopathy).
Train_Line_7562 The BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MF).
Train_Line_7563 Although half of the patients with DNMT3A mutations also had SF3B1 mutations, TET2 mutations were significantly enriched in both SRSF2 and ZRSR2 mutated patients.
Train_Line_7564 The LR-PSS was developed for this purpose in a cohort of 856 patients, but it has not been validated in an independent cohort of patients.
Train_Line_7565 Moreover, TP53 alterations were positively correlated with specific genomic aberrations, such as -5/5q- (P < .0001), -7/7q- (P = .003), concomitant -5/5q- and -7/7q- (P < .0001), and also -3/3p- (P = .002), -16/16q- (P < .0001), -18/18q- (P = .0008), and -20/20q- (P = .004); further correlations were identified for +1/+1p (P = .001), +11/+11q (P = .0002), +13/+13q (P = .02), +19/+19p (P = .04), and amplifications in 11q13~25 [amp(11)(q13~25)] (P = .0004; Table 1; Figure 2).
Train_Line_7566 Similarly, none of the three spliceosome mutations affected LFS; corresponding P values were 0.55 for SRSF2, 0.9 for SF3B1, and 0.38 for U2AF35 mutations, respectively (Fig. 2).
Train_Line_7567 Genomic DNA was extracted from samples using the All Prep DNA/RNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Train_Line_7569 Our observation suggests that a deregulation of JAK2 may precede the development of typical RARS-T.
Train_Line_7570 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7571 There was no significant difference in other clinical parameters, WHO classification, international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) score, revised IPSS (IPSS-R) score, and karyotype between the patients with IDH mutations and those without.
Train_Line_7572 Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and differences were assessed by Log-Rank analysis.
Train_Line_7573 Other causes of platelet dysfunction in ET or PV include acquired storage pool deficiency, increased platelet activation, decreased adrenergic receptor expression, impaired response to epinephrine, and decreased platelet membrane glycoprotein receptor expression.
Train_Line_7574 We checked mutation status of the U2AF1 by direct sequencing in 478 de novo MDS patients and correlated with the clinical characteristics and outcomes.
Train_Line_7575 The most frequently associated molecular event was FLT3/ITD (9 cases), followed by CEBPA (7 cases), and NPM1 (5 cases).
Train_Line_7576 In all three studies, FLT3 mutations were more frequent among cases progressing to AML and were associated with a trend to worse prognosis and decreased event free and OS.
Train_Line_7577 13.1 Prophylactic anti-infectious treatment.
Train_Line_7578 Mild abnormalities can be noted on careful evaluation of asymptomatic carriers.
Train_Line_7579 In addition, the interaction of SRSF2 mutation with other genetic alternations in MDS patients and its stability during disease progression remain to be determined.
Train_Line_7580 Sequence reads were aligned to the human genome (build 37) using the Burroughs-Wheeler algorithm.
Train_Line_7581 Given the relationship between TET2 and 5mC, several groups have attempted to understand whether patients with myeloid malignancies and TET2 mutations are more sensitive to DNA methyltransferase inhibitor therapy.
Train_Line_7582 These translocations/inversions result in fusion genes such AML-ETO and CBFB-MYHII, respectively, leading to impaired differentiation, while subsequent KIT mutation provides a proliferative and survival advantage.
Train_Line_7583 Firstly, SOCS3 plays a crucial negative regulatory role in erythroid differentiation as shown by the fact that Socs3-/- mice die as a result of erythrocytosis whereas Jak2-/- mice die due to the absence of erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_7584 Mitotic recombination of 9p24, leading to duplication of the JAK2 V617F mutation (homozygosity), has been detected in erythroid progenitors of most PV patients but not in ET.
Train_Line_7585 GENE SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS.
Train_Line_7586 This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Taiwan University Hospital.
Train_Line_7587 Twenty of 25 ZRSR2-mut patients were classified according to the WHO classification as RAEB-1 or RAEB-2 (80% vs 41% in ZRSR2-wt patients; P < .001, Table 1; supplemental Table 2).
Train_Line_7588 In PV, median survivals were ~23 and 9 years, in the absence of advanced age and leukocytosis or presence of both risk factors, respectively.
Train_Line_7589 In the case of RARS, the SF3B1 mutation must occur in a hematopoietic cell capable of myeloid differentiation and can cause a myelodysplastic phenotype without the need of additional mutations.
Train_Line_7590 SEQUENCING.
Train_Line_7591 We also selected 11 cases that were WT for any spliceosomal factor mutation (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures).
Train_Line_7592 The phenotype of these familial forms correspond either to a classic MPNs (PV, ET) in the absence of germinal transmission of JAK2V617F or MPLW515L, or to a larger spectrum of diseases (CML, systemic mastocytosis and also acute leukemia).
Train_Line_7593 Although prior DNA methylation profiling studies in AML have identified the presence of a profoundly abnormal epigenome in this disease, the identification of mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes now provides a link between the altered epigenome in AML and somatic genetic alterations in this disorder.
Train_Line_7594 Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; OS, overall survival.
Train_Line_7595 Mutations in DNMT3A can result in nonsense, frameshift, and missense alterations throughout the open-reading frame.
Train_Line_7596 Two hundred and thirty-three adult patients with de novo MDS diagnosed according to French-American-British (FAB) criteria at the National Taiwan University Hospital who had adequate cryopreserved BM cells were recruited into the study.
Train_Line_7597 The most common concomitant mutations found in BCOR-mut CMML patients affected U2AF1 in 3 cases (P = .003) and RUNX1 in 2 patients, while CBL, DNMT3A, NRAS, and TET2 mutations were found in single cases each.
Train_Line_7598 Table 2. Univariate and Multivariate Analysis for OS in All Studied Patients With AML.
Train_Line_7599 In univariable analyses, only TP53 mutations were associated with shorter overall (OS; hazard ratio [HR], 3.74; P < .001) and progression-free survival (HR, 3.97; P < .001).
Train_Line_7600 A recent phase 3 clinical trial (E1900; Clinical Trials.gov number, NCT00049517) from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) showed that induction therapy with cytarabine plus 90 mg of daunorubicin per square meter of body-surface area, as compared with cytarabine plus 45 mg of daunorubicin per square meter, improved the outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed AML who were 17 to 60 years of age 17; a similar study in patients who were older than 60 years of age showed that dose-intensified daunorubicin improved overall survival in patients 60 to 65 years of age.
Train_Line_7601 No advantage has been shown for autologous or allogeneic HSCT in frontline treatment.
Train_Line_7602 High-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) combined with daunorubicin in induction has been studied by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG; 2 g/m2 every 12 hours [q12h] on days 1-6), and the Australian Leukemia Study Group (ALSG; 3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 3, 5, and 7) in prospective randomized trials, and by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG; 3 g/m2 per q12h on days 1, 3, and 5) and SWOG (cytarabine 100 mg/m2 cont. IV on days 1-7, followed by HiDAC 2 g/m2 per q12h on days 8-10; "3 + 7 + 3") in phase 2 trials.
Train_Line_7603 In MDS and other myeloid neoplasms associated with sole del(5q), the presence of mutant IDH has been associated with inferior overall and leukemia-free survivals.
Train_Line_7604 In our BM experiments, we tested the effect of WT SH2B3 and SH2B3 mutants on growth of total colonies and could not define the exact effect of SH2B3 on erythroid cells.
Train_Line_7605 Determined by chromosome banding analysis.
Train_Line_7606 Mutation statuses of SRSF2 during disease evolution.
Train_Line_7607 BCOR was identified as a fusion partner of RAR-alpha in a single acute promyelocytic leukemia patient with 45,-Y,t(X;17)(p11;q12) and unique morphological and clinical features (ie, rectangular cytoplasmic bodies and multiple relapses after chemotherapy plus all-trans retinoic acid).
Train_Line_7608 Conclusion.
Train_Line_7609 Hence, we were able to include FLT3 mutation status data on MDS and CMML patients from January 1997 to December 2010.
Train_Line_7610 Methylation of the SOCS3 promoter CpG island was confirmed in three MF patients by bisulphite sequencing (Figure 2C).
Train_Line_7611 In multivariate analysis for time to AML progression, when only frameshift mutations in ASXL1 transfusion dependence, IDH1 mutation status, and karyotype were considered, ASXL1 mutations showed a shorter time to AML progression (HR, 2.39 95% CI, 1.12 to 5.09; P = .024; Table 4), whereas there was a trend toward shorter time to AML progression when point and frameshift mutations were considered together (HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 0.96 to 4.03; P = .064; Data Supplement).
Train_Line_7612 Genomic DNA from 73 MPD patients [15 with PV, 25 with ET and 33 with myelofibrosis (MF)] was assessed for acquired mutations.
Train_Line_7613 The majority of mutations were missense (n = 32), followed by deletions/insertions (n = 4) [all resulted in premature stop], splice site (n = 3) and nonsense mutation (n = 1).
Train_Line_7614 PV patients with the JAK2 V617F mutation commonly present with thrombocytosis and an older age of onset than patients harboring an exon 12 mutations, but their clinical course and outcome remains similar.
Train_Line_7615 Consequently, mutant calreticulin has an altered subcellular localization.
Train_Line_7616 Whether the identified genotype combinations are restricted to MDS or are also found in other myeloid or lymphoid malignancies needs to be established.
Train_Line_7617 Prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in MDS.
Train_Line_7618 A much larger proportion of melanomas have mutations in B-Raf, which is a downstream effector of KIT and would provide a similar proliferative stimulus.
Train_Line_7619 Conditional knockout of Dnmt3a in the germ cells showed lack of methylation of normally imprinted genes H19 and Dlk1-Gtl2.
Train_Line_7620 It is of interest that JAK2V617F, which is associated with ET and MF in humans, results in polycythemia and leukocytosis, but not thrombocytosis, in the same murine BMT model.
Train_Line_7621 The striking enrichment of SF3B1 mutation in patients with RARS and its low frequency in patients with excess of blasts would a priori imply that in a population of MDS patients, those carrying a mutant SF3B1 had a better clinical outcome than those with a wild-type gene.
Train_Line_7622 ASXL1 mutation is thus helpful for risk stratification of MDS patients with normal karyotype, which is categorized as an intermediate-risk cytogenetic group.
Train_Line_7623 Disease Overview.
Train_Line_7624 JAK2 exon 12 mutation-positive patients usually present with predominantly erythroid myelopoiesis, subnormal serum erythropoietin level and younger age at diagnosis, but were prognostically similar to JAK2V617F.
Train_Line_7625 With the exception of one patient with -7 as part of a complex anomaly, all patients with CK and TP53 mutations had abnormalities of chromosome 5.
Train_Line_7626 Median WBC, hemoglobin, platelet count, and ANC for the FLT3-mutated CMML patients at diagnosis were 31.3 3 109/l (range, 2.6-211.8), 10.1 g/l (range, 8.7-12.7), 120 3 109/l (range, 23-429), and 13.3 3 109/l (range, 0.5-108), respectively.
Train_Line_7627 Besides age, the most important covariates are cytogenetics and secondary AML (following MDS or MDS/MPN), WBC, performance status, and comorbidities.
Train_Line_7628 Pretreatment leukemic bone marrow and blood sample; for further optional storing see section 4.7.
Train_Line_7629 Four RARS-T patients had the JAK2 (V617F) mutation, whereas an additional one had the MPL (W515L) mutation.
Train_Line_7630 Patient 96 exhibited a homozygous missense mutation in exon 6 (p.R213L) and an additional heterozygous frameshift mutation in exon 4 (p.A74fs), suggesting that these had occurred sequentially, with p.R213L being the primary event followed by UPD(17p) resulting in the homozygous mutation pattern, whereas the p.A74fs mutation followed the recombination event (supplemental Figure 1).
Train_Line_7631 Dysgranulopoietic features included hypogranulation of myeloid cells, unevenly distributed granules and pseudoPelger forms (Figures 2B, F and G).
Train_Line_7632 In 10 cases, the disruptive mutation was validated with either genomic DNA or cDNA.
Train_Line_7633 Interestingly, in the same study, FLT3-ITD frequency was 12% in both secondary and therapy-related AML, 22% in de novo AML and up to 27% in relapsed AML.
Train_Line_7634 Aberrant TP53 gene expression was also investigated by way of association with cytosine methylation in the gene promoter.
Train_Line_7635 A cohort of patients with myeloproliferative disorders was assessed for acquired mutations, aberrant expression and/or CpG island hypermethylation of SOCS1 and SOCS3.
Train_Line_7636 JAK2 EXON 12 MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_7637 The outcome, in terms of both OS and leukaemic progression, is extremely poor for patients with TP53 mutation, even after adjustment for cytogenetic risk.
Train_Line_7638 DDX41 defects led to loss of tumor suppressor function due to altered pre-mRNA splicing and RNA processing.
Train_Line_7639 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was available for one of these three patients and showed deletion of 5q and 7q.
Train_Line_7640 Until recently, the molecular basis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has remained essentially elusive.
Train_Line_7641 Such assays now allow the screening of millions of small molecules to hopefully lead to the discovery of novel compounds that will indeed restore C/EBPalpha function and will be lead compounds in further clinical development for the treatment of AML and other cancers where the C/EBPalpha pathway is involved.
Train_Line_7642 Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier curves for OS and time to AML transformation. (A-B) The SF3B1 mutation status. (C-D) The SRSF2 mutation status. (E-F) The ZRSR2 mutation status. (G-H) The U2AF35 mutation status in 198 MDS patients (log-rank test).
Train_Line_7643 The therapeutic value of FLT3 inhibitors should be explored in mutated patients.
Train_Line_7644 Identification of novel targets to direct new treatment approaches remains a major challenge in MDS.
Train_Line_7645 The relationship between thrombosis and leukocytosis, thrombosis, and JAK2V617F or pregnancy-associated complications and JAK2V617F have been examined by different groups of investigators with findings that were conflicting and inconclusive.
Train_Line_7646 Diagnosis: Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_7647 Neither the LR-PSS, the IPSS, nor any other published prognostic MDS model considers somatic mutations as prognostic criteria, although mutations are key drivers of disease phenotype.
Train_Line_7648 Abbreviations: HR, hazard ratio; FLT3-ITD, internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene.
Train_Line_7649 Patients with two or three of these factors had a 10-year RS of 26%, compared with 59% and 84% in patients with one and no risk factors, respectively.
Train_Line_7650 In the Swedish Adult Acute Leukemia Registry, a true population-based registry, 198 of 727 (27%) patients age 65 to 74 and 800 of 1 115 (72%) patients age older than 74 did not receive intensive chemotherapy but palliation only.
Train_Line_7651 For instance, at least 3 studies have identified that inhibition of PRC2 activity by genetic inactivation of EZH2 has potential therapeutic efficacy in the context of MLL-AF9-driven leukemias.
Train_Line_7652 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7653 Overall, ABCB7 protein deficiency results in mitochondrial iron overload, reduced heme synthesis in immature RBCs, and ineffective erythropoiesis.
Train_Line_7654 In various hematopoietic cells, analysis of mRNA showed BRCC3 globally expressed in myeloid, erythroid and lymphoid cells (Online Supplementary Figure S3).
Train_Line_7655 The result of sequential analysis of the 127 patients without U2AF1 mutation at diagnosis is not shown; none of these patients acquired U2AF1 mutation. 66 of them had disease progression, including 50 patients with transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), during the clinical course.
Train_Line_7656 The current debate as to whether an SF3B1 mutation is a gain-of-function or a loss-offunction mutation is partly meaningless.
Train_Line_7657 The coexistence of SH2B3 mutations with JAK2 V617F in MPN samples, and the suggested higher prevalence of these mutations in the blast phase of MPN compared to the chronic phase (Pardanani et al 2010), suggest that SH2B3 mutations may collaborate in the development and/or progression of MPN.
Train_Line_7658 The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomized 293 patients between 1967 and 1978 for treatment with either radiophosphorus or oral busulfan.
Train_Line_7659 We therefore examined whether the mutations associated with higher-risk features are disproportionately represented in the higherrisk LR-PSS categories.
Train_Line_7660 Although eating fresh fruits and/or vegetables is often discouraged, there is little evidence that adherence to such a "neutropenic diet" prevents infections.
Train_Line_7661 Clinical phenotype of the cases with BRCC3 mutations.
Train_Line_7662 Additional genes known to be mutated in MDS include RUNX1, TEL/ETV6, TP53, and NRAS.
Train_Line_7663 Of note, in our study, CK+/MK+ AMLs were significantly associated with TP53 alterations, found in 80% of CK+/MK+ AML compared with only 42% in CK+/MK- AML.
Train_Line_7664 No bone marrow sample was available for mutation analysis at first relapse.
Train_Line_7665 The sensitivity of our allele specific-PCR assay is <1%.
Train_Line_7666 It is interesting that NUP98 (on 11p15) and WT1 (on p13) involved in these 2 gene alterations are located in proximity on chromosome 11p.
Train_Line_7667 While the clinical utility of this information remains in its infancy, novel therapeutic agents aimed at the aberrant underlying processes have merit and promise and are being tested in mechanism based trials including rational combination therapies.
Train_Line_7668 Similarly, the incidence of AML in patients treated with hydroxyurea, compared to a historical control treated with either chlorambucil or radiophosphorus, was significantly lower (5.9 % vs. 10.6% vs. 8.3%, respectively, in the first 11 years of treatment).
Train_Line_7669 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7670 Similarly, the two largest noncontrolled studies in ET and PV do not support the concern that leukemia might arise from the use of hydroxyurea and there is additional evidence to that effect from long-term studies of patients receiving hydroxyurea for sickle cell disease.
Train_Line_7671 Sequential analysis of IDH mutations in 454 samples from 151 patients showed the original mutations in the IDH-mutated patients were retained except for the two patients who achieved complete remission after chemotherapy while none of the patients without the mutation at diagnosis acquired a novel one during follow-ups, indicating that IDH mutations may play little role in the progression of the disease.
Train_Line_7672 It is estimated that >90% of human genes undergo alternative splicing and translate into various protein isoforms for different functions, so this splicing process is important for gene expression diversity.
Train_Line_7673 Thus our findings suggest that DNMT3A mutations have a stronger effect on disease proliferation and treatment resistance in AML cells that are more immature compared with more mature AML.
Train_Line_7674 The pLKO.1_DDX41-shRNA and the control non-target shRNA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Train_Line_7675 cDNA from the KG1A cell line was used to construct a standard curve for ASXL1.
Train_Line_7676 The mechanism of activation of MPL by these alleles is not fully understood, and it will be of value to obtain structural insight into the role of the cytoplasmic transmembrane- junction region in the regulation of MPL signal transduction.
Train_Line_7677 Accordingly, the goal of current therapy in PV and ET is primarily to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications, without increasing bleeding risk, and secondarily to control the aforementioned symptoms.
Train_Line_7678 The number of viable cells was determined using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, San Luis Obispo, California, United States).
Train_Line_7679 For germline controls, DNA was obtained from paired CD3+ T cells or buccal swab.
Train_Line_7680 SOCS2 may also inhibit JAK2V617F signaling, and its promoter is hypermethylated in some MPN.
Train_Line_7681 For an in-depth analysis of this topic, the reader is referred to a recent review by Han et al.
Train_Line_7682 Management of low-risk PV or ET, in the absence of extreme thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_7683 We also observed that DNMT3A mutations and MLL translocations were mutually exclusive (P<0.01).
Train_Line_7684 In each case, expression of these mutations led to increased JAK-STAT signaling and expression of these mutant disease alleles in mice led to a myeloproliferative disease phenotype.
Train_Line_7685 Diagnosis is ascertained by cytochemical and/or immunohistochemical analyses.
Train_Line_7686 Diagnoses were confirmed according to 2008 World Health Organization classification criteria.
Train_Line_7687 Furthermore, in seven cases of double mutations, each mutation was found at similar abundance, suggesting the possibility of one mutation in each of the TP53 alleles (compound heterozygote) in a single disease clone or two mutations in the same allele.
Train_Line_7688 ASXL1 maps to chromosome region 20q11, close to the DNMT3B gene, and belongs to a family of three paralogs.
Train_Line_7689 To assess the frequency of TP53 alterations and their correlation with other genetic changes and outcome in acute myeloid leukemia with complex karyotype (CK-AML), we performed integrative analysis using TP53 mutational screening and array-based genomic profiling in 234 CK-AMLs.
Train_Line_7690 The lack of correlation between the presence of TET2 mutations and prognosis in MDS suggests that several other factors affect the MDS phenotype.
Train_Line_7691 Of note, there was no significant difference (P < .462) in the total number of genomic aberrations between TET2-mutated and nonmutated patients.
Train_Line_7692 Clinical and hematologic data were recorded after patients had given their informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the scientific analysis of the samples was approved by the institutional review board of Hannover Medical School (n. 2467).
Train_Line_7693 The lower incidence of thromboembolic complications might be related to our observation that patients with a CALR mutation had lower hemoglobin levels and lower white-cell counts than those with the JAK2 mutation.
Train_Line_7694 Five (25%) patients with U2AF35 mutations had 1% BM RS, with 2 (40%) having 15% BM RS.
Train_Line_7695 The authors suggest that cancer stem cell drugs, possibly combined with imatinib, might target these cells.
Train_Line_7696 Furthermore, among patients receiving HDAC, those with RAS mutations also had a lower risk of relapse than patients with the wild-type RAS.
Train_Line_7697 Outcome after autologous HSCT is at least as good as after the use of postremission chemotherapy; however, there has been no evidence of an improvement in outcome. Autologous HSCT may offer an advantage in specific subsets of AML.
Train_Line_7698 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are neoplastic disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell that are characterized by peripheral cytopenias and a variable propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_7699 The DNA spanning the mutation spots of ASXL1 detected at either diagnosis or during subsequent follow-ups was amplified and the PCR products were then cloned into the TA-cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Train_Line_7700 The assessment of SF3B1 mutation status may become innovative diagnostic and prognostic tools and the availability of spliceosome modulators opens novel therapeutic prospects.
Train_Line_7701 Collectively, the data suggest that alterations in DNMTs are associated with cancer, but direct evidence in humans has been lacking.
Train_Line_7702 All ASXL1 mutations detected at diagnosis remained unchanged during disease progression but were frequently accompanied with acquisition of other novel genetic alterations.
Train_Line_7703 Here, we describe an adult familial acute myeloid leukemia (AML) syndrome caused by germline mutations in the DEAD/H-box helicase gene DDX41.
Train_Line_7704 Only including simple chromosomal abnormalities with 2 or fewer changes, but not those with complex abnormalities with 3 or more aberrations.
Train_Line_7705 ASXL1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor irrespective of age, IPSS-R and mutations of RUNX1, NRAS, DNMT3A, IDH and SRSF2.
Train_Line_7706 CALR EXON 9 MUTATIONS IN MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS.
Train_Line_7707 Clone: A group of cells that derive from a common parent cell and share its genome.
Train_Line_7708 In our cohort, DNMT3A mutations were associated with a higher platelet count and bone marrow blast count.
Train_Line_7709 Treated with Lenalidomide.
Train_Line_7710 DNA de-methylation similarly has a well-regulated and organized pathway involving conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine as an intermediate step.
Train_Line_7711 To clarify whether the nucleotide duplication might be a PCR artifact or a true mutation, we sequenced ASXL1 in 65 healthy volunteers.
Train_Line_7712 Based on mapping minimally deleted regions of loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 4q24 by SNP-based array technology, recurrent mutations in TET2, the protein responsible for 5mc to 5hmc conversion, were identified in MPN and MDS patients.
Train_Line_7713 Three or more chromosome abnormalities in the absence of one of the WHO designated recurring translocations or inversions, that is, t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16), t(9;11), t(v;11)(v;q23), t(6;9), inv(3) or t(3;3); indicate how many complex karyotype cases have involvement of chromosome arms 5q, 7q, and 17p.
Train_Line_7714 We previously showed that IDH mutations were quite stable in AML patients during disease progression.
Train_Line_7715 Induction chemotherapy should be started after the diagnostic work-up has been completed, preferably with minimal delay.
Train_Line_7716 More likely, they occur during the clonal progression of the disease and determine the emergence of more aggressive subclones.
Train_Line_7717 Multiple groups arrived at this discovery by various means (reviewed in detail by Kilpivaara and Levine): the identification of uniparental disomy at common sites of LOH on chromosome 9p24, candidate gene approaches, and PV cell culture studies in growth factor deficient media which failed to proliferate in the presence of JAK2 siRNA.
Train_Line_7718 Although heterozygous de novo germ-line mutations in SETBP1 have been shown to be associated with the Schinzel-Giedion midface retraction syndrome, somatic mutations have been recently detected in patients with myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_7719 The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications.
Train_Line_7720 Most relapses occur within 1 to 3 years after the end of therapy.
Train_Line_7721 Molecular diagnosis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the recurring gene fusions, such as RUNX-1RUNX1T1, CBFB-MYH11, MLLT3-MLL, DEK-NUP214, can be useful in certain circumstances.
Train_Line_7722 Evaluation of deep sequencing demonstrated that the mean value of variant allelic frequency of BRCC3 mutations was 30.1% (range 91.7-3.5).
Train_Line_7723 Pilot studies combining intensive induction and consolidation therapy with FLT3 inhibitors have shown promising response rates in patients with FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_7724 100-Day Landmark and Regression Analyses.
Train_Line_7725 Next-generation sequencing approaches have identified mutations in genes encoding multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery.
Train_Line_7726 12.3 Myeloid sarcoma.
Train_Line_7727 Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed as previously reported.
Train_Line_7728 However, these mutated genes do not have a primary role in the pathogenesis of essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis associated with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL.
Train_Line_7729 The clinical and hematologic characteristics of patients with mutated versus wild-type (WT) SRSF2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 are shown in Table 1, supplemental Table 2, and supplemental Table 3, respectively.
Train_Line_7730 They found that frameshift mutations, but not point mutations, had an independent prognostic effect in MDS patients.
Train_Line_7731 Interferon therapy.
Train_Line_7732 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7733 The neutrophilic granulopoiesis (Figures 1H and I; naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase reaction) showed a wide range from mild proliferation (Figure 1H) to normal frequency or a slight decrease (Figure 1I).
Train_Line_7734 In addition to this, no mutations were found in a control group of bone marrow DNA from 12 normal healthy persons after sequencing at depth (average, 500X).
Train_Line_7735 Interferon therapy.
Train_Line_7736 Thirty patients (13%) received erythropoietic stimulating agents, 15 (7%) received induction type chemotherapy (anthracycline 1 cytarabine), 20 (9%) received hypomethylating agents (5-Azacytidine; n = 14 and decitabine; n = 6), while 5 (2%) underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_7737 We completed sequencing of 31 established lung cancer cell lines and 50 primary lung cancers and identified mutations of C/EBPalpha in only three of 81 specimens examined.
Train_Line_7738 An estimate of long-term survival can be obtained by assessing a defined set of prognostic factors as shown in Table 7.
Train_Line_7739 Independent PCR and GS FLX sequencing experiments were performed for confirmation of mutations in all cases (giving >600x total coverage across a given mutation).
Train_Line_7740 Following the identification of JAK2 mutations, candidate gene approaches were applied to additional JAK-STAT signaling pathways to account for the 50% of ET and PMF patients wild type for JAK2.
Train_Line_7741 C/EBPalpha is expressed at high levels in a specific subset of tissues and cell types, such as liver, adipose tissue, myeloid cells, and airway epithelial cells.
Train_Line_7742 TP53 alterations were correlated with the total number of losses (mean += SD; 9.54 += 7.49 vs 4.00 += 4.88, P < .0001), gains (3.91 += 3.80 vs 1.94 += 1.92, P < .0001), high-level DNA amplifications (0.84 += 1.31 vs 0.21 += 0.83, P = .0002), and genomic complexity as measured by total number of aberrations per case (14.30 += 9.41 vs 6.16 += 5.53, P < .0001).
Train_Line_7743 The iron of ring sideroblasts is stored in mitochondrial ferritin, encoded by the FTMT gene, which is typically overexpressed in RARS.
Train_Line_7744 The two-sided level of significance was set at P < .05.
Train_Line_7745 Mutations in MPL were screened for by allele-specific PCR using a common primer GTTTCTTCCTAGCCTGGATCTCCTTGG and fluorescently labeled primers FAMAAACTGTAGTGTGCAGGAAACTGCA (for MPLW515L) and FAM-AAAAAACTGTAGTGTGCAGGAAACTGCT (for MPL-W515K).
Train_Line_7746 Patients with low-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) that rapidly progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain a challenge in disease management.
Train_Line_7747 Finally, an altered ABCB7 exon usage was found in primary cells from patients with SF3B1-mutated RARS.
Train_Line_7748 DNMT3A MUTATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATION WITH PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS.
Train_Line_7749 For each reported SF3B1 variant, the proportion of cells in a DNA sample that carry the variant can be directly estimated by calculating the proportion of sequencing reads reporting the mutant allele.
Train_Line_7750 Conversely, Schnittger et alreported that SRSF2 mutation were mutually exclusive with EZH2 mutation in CMML patients.
Train_Line_7751 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_7752 Among these mutations, the clinical relevance of 2 prevalent mutations, U2AF35, and SF3B1, have been explored.
Train_Line_7753 This was set at 70 years (ie, the round value closest to the median age).
Train_Line_7754 Analyses were restricted to patients enrolled into AMLSG multicenter treatment trials applying age-adjusted intensive chemotherapy (n = 155, median age, 59 years; range, 18-81 years).
Train_Line_7755 It is made at 7 to 10 days after chemotherapy.
Train_Line_7756 +8 (n = 8), complex (n = 7), del(7q) (n = 5), t(8;16)(p11;p13) (n = 3), and 1 patient each of +5, +13, +21, del(Yq), del(20q), i(17q), t(2;12), t(2;17), t(16;19), t(9;22), t(1;3), and t(2;14).
Train_Line_7757 We found that WT1 mutations occurred with similar frequencies in patients with normal karyotype and those with abnormal cytogenetics.
Train_Line_7758 However, there are differences in disease biology of NPM1/FLT3 high-risk and low-risk patients that may provide a different molecular context in which mutated DNMT3A may have different effects.
Train_Line_7759 IDH mutations including IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were closely associated with SRSF2 mutations in primary myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_7760 LNK-deficient mice have an increased HSC pool with enhanced self-renewal properties and increased quiescence.
Train_Line_7761 In the current analysis of adult patients with primary AML, all of whom were enrolled on the same treatment protocol, achieved complete remission, and have prolonged follow-up, there was no significant difference in outcome between patients with and without RAS mutations, which was similar to the findings of most previous studies.
Train_Line_7762 There was a trend towards an association between SOCS3 methylation and lower SOCS3 expression in JAK2 V617F negative patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis but not in JAK2 V617F positive ones.
Train_Line_7763 This signal is absent in mutant calreticulin.
Train_Line_7764 The domain structure of KIT and the location of some common mutations are illustrated in Figure 1.
Train_Line_7765 Intriguingly, mutations were predominantly found within the M1 and M2 FAB morphological subtypes, and no mutations were found in patients with a t(8;21), inv(16), or t(15;17) karyotypic abnormality.
Train_Line_7766 Recently, mutations targeting genes whose products participate to the early steps of RNA splicing (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, and U2AF1) have been reported.
Train_Line_7767 In patients with PV or ET and extreme thrombocytosis, the use of aspirin can lead to bleeding complications because of AvWS; therefore, in the presence of platelets >1,000 x 109/L, screening for ristocetin cofactor activity is advised and consideration be given to withhold aspirin therapy if the result shows <30% activity.
Train_Line_7768 A multivariate analysis for outcomes could not be performed due to the small sample size of patients with mutations, indicating that a larger cohort from a clinical trial will be needed to definitively address the effect of DNMT3A mutations on outcomes.
Train_Line_7769 This supports our previous observation that the myeloblast count underestimates the size of the mutant clone in MDS16 and further suggests that hematopoiesis is clonal in early stage MDS and that the DNMT3A mutations are acquired early in MDS pathogenesis.
Train_Line_7770 A conservative Glu76 mutation was found in only 1% of individuals with Noonan syndrome.
Train_Line_7771 Chromosome data were available in 446 patients at diagnosis, including 21 with IDH mutations and 425 without (Table II).
Train_Line_7772 Interestingly, patient 2306, with LOH on the TET2 locus, had a mutation that was at 39% RMA, indicative of the mutation arising after the chromosomal abnormality.
Train_Line_7773 These mutations result in expression of enzymes with altered enzymatic activity and produce an onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxygluterate (2-HG), which poisons the catalytic activity of TET2.
Train_Line_7774 De novo methylation events are carried out by the DNA methyltransferease, DNMT3A.
Train_Line_7775 Patients 1 through 31 had WT1 mutations at diagnosis; patients 32 through 35 had no WT1 mutations at diagnosis but acquired the mutation at relapse.
Train_Line_7776 ASXL1, together with ASXL2 and ASXL3, are related to the Drosophila melanogaster additional sex combs (Asx), a polycomb gene required for long-term repression of the HOX genes.
Train_Line_7777 When we analyzed RNA expression patterns (Boultwood et al, 2007), low ZMYM2 mRNA levels were associated with down-modulation of SMC3, RAD21, and RUNX1, which were also significantly under-expressed in cases with low DDX41 (Figure S7E).
Train_Line_7778 RA indicates refractory anemia; RARS, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; del(5q), MDS with isolated del(5q); RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; RAEB-1, refractory anemia with excess blasts-1; RAEB-2, refractory anemia with excess blasts-2; MDS-U, MDS-unclassifiable; and fs, frameshift.
Train_Line_7779 This patient was a 77-year-old male with RAEB-1, who had a normal bone marrow karyotype (IPSS-R-good) and died secondary to pneumonia 4 months after diagnosis.
Train_Line_7780 In contrast, the risk of thrombosis, in both PV and ET, exceeds 20% and a substantial proportion of patients experience vasomotor disturbances (e.g., headaches, lightheadedness, acral paresthesias, erythromelalgia, atypical chest pain), and in case of PV, pruritus.
Train_Line_7781 Our understanding of the effects of these mutations on hematopoiesis and potential for therapeutic targeting of specific AML subsets is also reviewed here.
Train_Line_7782 Interestingly, earlier studies indicated that, in the majority of melanomas, KIT expression is lost on progression indicating distinct roles for KIT in different types of melanoma.
Train_Line_7783 Both brothers were successfully treated with lenalidomide for transfusion-dependent anemia.
Train_Line_7784 Interestingly, FLT3-ITD was present in none of the 10 BCOR-mutated patients, as opposed to 19 of 96 (19.8%) BCOR-unmutated patients (Table 3 block B).
Train_Line_7785 In multivariate analysis when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence and International Prognostic Scoring System score, IDH1 mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in myelodysplastic syndromes (HR 3.57; 95% CI 1.59-8.02; P=0.002).
Train_Line_7786 Interestingly, they were demonstrated to be wild-type for these genes as well as for NPM1 and FLT3-ITD, thus paralleling the molecular background of the AML index patient subjected to WES.
Train_Line_7787 ICF patients have loss of methylated pericentromeric sequences, resulting in chromosomal instability in lymphocytes and a severe immunodeficiency.
Train_Line_7788 In de novo AML, between 12% and 27% of patients harbor RAS mutations.
Train_Line_7789 Genetic analysis of EZH2 would therefore significantly improve prediction of prognosis in lower-risk MDS.
Train_Line_7790 All these developments prompted an international expert panel to provide updated recommendations for the diagnosis and management of adult patients with AML, excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) for which recommendations were published separately.
Train_Line_7791 TP53, TET2, and DNMT3A mutations occurred in largely nonoverlapping groups of patients, and nearly one half of the cohort (47%) had a mutation in >= one of these three genes.
Train_Line_7792 SF3B1 gene mutation has been reported to have significant impact on OS in 2 studies, but not in others.
Train_Line_7793 Consequently, DNA repair defects may play important roles in maintenance of chromosomal integrity and predisposition to secondary molecular defects.
Train_Line_7794 In addition to participating in the splicing process, SRSF2 is known to be involved in the regulation of DNA stability.
Train_Line_7795 This analysis revealed a striking global decrease of histone 3H lysine 27 methylation, a histone mark associated with repression of transcription placed by the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2).
Train_Line_7796 Other kinase inhibitors, mostly broad spectrum, are currently being evaluated in clinical trials in GIST (reviewed [44]).
Train_Line_7797 Genotypic analysis of the HapMap panel of normal patients was performed using a mass spectrometric assay as previously described.
Train_Line_7798 C/EBPalpha is expressed in normal prostate epithelium with strong expression observed in the basal layer.
Train_Line_7799 Given that U2AF1 mutation was a poor-prognostic factor for leukemic transformation in lower-risk patients, a Cox regression test limiting to patients with IPSS low or intermediate-1 risk disease was done.
Train_Line_7800 The quantity and integrity of RNA was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm with a Nanodrop ND8000 (Labtech, Uckfield, Sussex, UK) and bioanalyser (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
Train_Line_7801 Advanced age was associated with the presence of one or more mutations (48% < 60 years v 77% >= 60 years; P <= .001), but no individual gene mutation was significantly associated with age.
Train_Line_7802 Mononuclear cells obtained from BM aspirates were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and cryopreserved on the same day of sample collection.
Train_Line_7803 Single prospective trials have neither shown a definitive advantage nor disadvantage in OS of allogeneic HSCT for patients with AML in first CR (CR1).
Train_Line_7804 A challenging observation is the presence of an allelic T:G ratio of 99% in one patient suggesting that nearly all bone marrow cells carried two copies of mutant JAK2.
Train_Line_7805 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SF3B1 MUTATIONS AND CLINICAL OUTCOME IN MDS.
Train_Line_7806 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7807 P95 was also a frequent site for deletions and insertions; delP95R-R102 in 7 (8%) and R94-P95insR in 1 (1%) patient.
Train_Line_7808 Similarly, the two largest non-controlled studies in ET and PV do not support the concern that leukemia might arise from the use of hydroxyurea and there is additional evidence to that effect from long-term studies of patients receiving hydroxyurea for sickle cell disease.
Train_Line_7809 Finally, hematopoietic cells that express MPLW515L are hypersensitive to stimulation with TPO as assessed by cell proliferation and Western blot analysis, suggesting MPLW515L-positive hematopoietic progenitors may have a selective proliferative advantage as compared with wild-type progenitors in MF patients.
Train_Line_7810 The relevance of this mutation is underscored by its effect in the murine bone marrow transplant assay, as expression of MPLW515L induces myeloproliferation characterized by splenomegaly, leukocytosis, marked thrombocytosis, extramedullary hematopoeisis, and myelofibrosis.
Train_Line_7811 Moreover, in patients without RAS mutations, the RAS-dependent pathways are also frequently affected by relatively frequent mutations in other genes (ie, FLT3, KIT, and PDGFR).
Train_Line_7812 The main abnormality in myelofibrosis is for the bone marrow to become filled with fibrous (scar) tissue (hence the name myelofibrosis), which stops it from producing normal blood cells efficiently.
Train_Line_7813 The majority (90%, n = 36) of mutations were located in the DNA binding domain and 2 each in the tetramerization and transactivation domain (Fig 2 and Table SIII).
Train_Line_7814 Apoptosis Assays.
Train_Line_7815 They are usually involved in negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) by competitive blocking of signaling and they induce RTK proteosomal degradation by mediating ubiquitination in endosomes.
Train_Line_7816 Our results confirm that alteration of PTPN11 is a rare event in the leukemogenesis of adult myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_7817 Priming with growth factors remains an active field of clinical investigation; it cannot be recommended in routine practice.
Train_Line_7818 Response criteria should meet the specific objective of a study, for example, in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials CR or CR with incomplete blood recovery (CRi) should be the appropriate end point, whereas in phase 1 clinical trials, the criteria of partial remission (PR) and morphologic leukemia-free state may also be useful.
Train_Line_7819 For example, gene- and microRNA-expression profiling have proven valuable for the discovery of novel leukemia subgroups and of prognostic signatures.
Train_Line_7820 Because the negatively charged C-terminal domain of calreticulin is the low-affinity, highcapacity, Ca2+-binding domain, the Ca2+-binding function of the mutant protein may be impaired.
Train_Line_7821 Whether mutations in different domains contribute differently to phenotypic expression needs to be addressed in larger studies.
Train_Line_7822 The 37 mutations in SF3B1 were all heterozygous missense mutations affecting 6 mutational hotspots that are located in the HEAT domains 3 to 6 (Figure 1).
Train_Line_7823 Patients with refractory anemia (RA) and RA with ring sideroblasts had a lower incidence (10.5% and 11.8%, respectively) of ASXL1 mutation than patients with RA with excess blasts (RAEB, 25.5%) or RAEB in transformation (30.8%; P<0.001).
Train_Line_7824 Thus, for individual clinical decision making, it is recommended to take into account both the disease risk as best assessed by the cytogenetic and molecular genetic profile of the leukemia and the risk associated with the transplant itself as assessed by comorbidity and other transplant-related risk indices.
Train_Line_7825 DNMT3A mutations.
Train_Line_7826 Only 4 to 6 genes are consistently mutated in >=10% MDS patients, whereas a long tail of ~50 genes are mutated less frequently.
Train_Line_7827 The scientists here wanted to look at other genes to see if they could find any changes that might trigger MF.
Train_Line_7828 The bicistronic retroviral MSCV-IRES-GFP (MIG) murine Sh2b3 vectors (WT and R364E) were generously provided by Dr. W. Tong (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA; Tong & Lodish, 2004).
Train_Line_7829 Potential somatic mutations (present in tumor, but not in the matched normal sample) were confirmed by independent PCR and sequencing.
Train_Line_7830 In the current study of 277 patients with MDS, IDH mutations were detected in 34 (12%) cases: 26 IDH2 (all R140Q) and 8 IDH1 (6 R132S and 2 R132C).
Train_Line_7831 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7832 For patients without adverse cytogenetics, good performance status and no significant comorbidity, standard "3 + 7" induction followed by repetitive cycles of modest dose consolidation may be an acceptable norm, with recent results from the Swedish National Registry suggesting that this approach is associated with longer survival than lower doses of similar therapy.
Train_Line_7833 Among 24 children with de novo AML, we identified a novel TTT>AAA trinucleotide substitution at position 211-213 (resulting in the amino-acid substitution F71K) in an infant with acute monoblastic leukemia.
Train_Line_7834 Hence, in both granulocytes and mononuclear cells, SOCS3 expression was higher in JAK2 V617F-positive IMF patients than in JAK2 V617F-negative patients.
Train_Line_7835 In order to study the binding of SH2B3 mutants to 14-3-3, SH2B3 WT and mutants were expressed in 293T cells, endogenous 14-3-3 was immunoprecipitated and Western blotted with a SH2B3 antibody (Fig 5B).
Train_Line_7836 Collectively, the growing list of somatic mutations in MDS that affect histone modifying proteins, and now the DNA methyltransferase gene DNMT3A, may provide a potential mechanism for the clinical activity observed in some MDS patients treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.
Train_Line_7837 Total RNA was isolated from total mononuclear cells, using a combination of TriZOL reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) to lyse the cells and RNAeasy Mini prep (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) to purify the RNA, as previously described (Kordasti et al 2012).
Train_Line_7838 Moreover, one patient (UPC 2719) who had UPD at TET2 also had 2 mutations that differed significantly in abundance from each other in bone marrow (69% vs 22% RMA), a relationship that was maintained in isolated CD34+ and T-cell populations, suggesting that LOH and TET2 mutations are independent events in some MDS patients.
Train_Line_7839 However, the proportion of WHO categories defined by ring sideroblasts (RARS, RCMD-RS, and RARS-T) was higher within patients with a mutant allele burden >= 25% (indicating a dominant clone) than in those with a burden < 25% (indicating a minority clone, P = .022)
Train_Line_7840 Recently, through next-generation whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing, recurrent somatic mutations involving the RNA splicing machinery were identified in a substantial proportion of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_7841 Important examples are mutations in Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA), both of which are associated with a favorable outcome and lack of a transplant benefit.
Train_Line_7842 Only 2 of 38 patients (5.3%) with AML evolving from MDS carried an SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_7843 Number of patients (% among the FAB subgroup).
Train_Line_7844 Third, the treatment of MDS may vary in different institutes.
Train_Line_7845 MDS with isolated deletion 5q harbouring a TP53 mutation (median OS 23 months) had significantly worse outcome compared with del5q patients without mutation (median OS 66 months, P < 0.002; Fig 3D).
Train_Line_7846 Recommendations.
Train_Line_7847 Table 4. Univariate and Multivariate Analyses for Time to AML Transformation in Patients With MDS and With Mutated or Unmutated ASXL1.
Train_Line_7848 Among these two second-line drugs, I prefer the use of INF-a for patients younger than age 65 years and busulfan in the older age group, although there is no controlled evidence to support or refute such a strategy.
Train_Line_7849 Busulfan is started at 4 mg/day, withheld in the presence of platelets <100 x 109 /L or WBC <3 x 109 /L, and the dose is reduced to 2 mg/day if the corresponding levels are <150 x 109 /L and <5 x 109 /L.
Train_Line_7850 Mutant sequence burden of BCOR mutated patients.
Train_Line_7851 Interestingly, we identified 2 patients with 4q24 UPD and TET2 mutations at RMA 97% and 39%, respectively.
Train_Line_7852 Together these analyses strongly indicate that SETD2 inactivation occurs primarily through point mutation and downregulation of gene expression in hematologic malignancies.
Train_Line_7853 Interestingly, C/EBPalpha is detected at the level of bronchoalveolar stem cells (unpublished data), a cell population that has been recently linked to adenocarcinoma initiation.
Train_Line_7854 Hereditary thrombocytosis has also been reported with germline JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617I) and associated with vascular events but not fibrotic/leukemic progression.
Train_Line_7855 Even then, it is important to remember that leukemic transformation in PV or ET usually arises from JAK2V617F-negative progenitors and that the presence of JAK2V617F might actually be protective against fibrotic progression.
Train_Line_7856 Acute leukemia during pregnancy should be managed jointly by the hematologist, obstetrician, and neonatologist.
Train_Line_7857 Cytogenetic analysis was performed centrally by G- and R-banding analysis.
Train_Line_7858 At this stage it is unclear what duration of imatinib treatment is necessary, but one study has shown that discontinuation in responding patients after 3 years was associated with rapid progression.
Train_Line_7859 During a recent international study of over 1,000 patients with ET, the prognostically detrimental effect (on survival, leukemic transformation, and fibrotic progression) of prefibrotic morphology was demonstrated and the study also identified age >60 years, leukocyte count >11 x 109/L, anemia, and thrombosis history as additional independent risk factors for survival.
Train_Line_7860 Another Piece of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Puzzle.
Train_Line_7861 A time-dependent variable for interaction between mutation status and natural log of time was also included in these models to test the proportional hazards assumption.
Train_Line_7862 FLT3 mutations were analyzed in the clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory at MDACC.
Train_Line_7863 Initially, MPNs were considered as simple, single-hit diseases that lead to an increase in mature blood cells.
Train_Line_7864 In univariate analysis, the presence of SRSF2 (P = 0.67), SF3B1 (P = 0.96), or U2AF35 (P = 0.49) mutations had no prognostic impact on OS (Fig. 1).
Train_Line_7865 Structure and Function of C/EBPalpha.
Train_Line_7866 Screening of control and sporadic AML populations was performed using high resolution melt analysis (Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Note).
Train_Line_7867 Patients with mutant TP53 had a paucity of mutations in other genes implicated in myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_7868 A similar result was obtained when the Italian and German series were analyzed separately (Table 3 blocks C1 and C2, respectively).
Train_Line_7869 This observation complements our results and suggests that the effect of the SH2B3 mutations may be specific to the cell type and the cytokine receptor.
Train_Line_7870 In accord with this, the authors demonstrated that knockdown of EglN1 prevented transformation of TF-1 cells in the presence of 2-HG or mutant IDH1 expression.
Train_Line_7871 Retrospective studies show that patients with C/EBPalpha mutant AML have an improved prognosis (Fig 3C).
Train_Line_7872 BM, bone marrow; Hgb, hemoglobin; Hct, hematocrit; Epo, erythropoietin; EEC, endogenous erythroid colony; WHO, World Health Organization; CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia; PV, polycythemia vera; PMF, primary myelofibrosis; MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.
Train_Line_7873 It should be noted that, although germ-line mutations of both RUNX1 or GATA2 may predispose to MDS, somatic mutations of the same genes may represent mechanisms of disease progression in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_7874 Subgroup analysis showed that the poor impact of SRSF2 mutation on OS was only demonstrated in the patients of lower risk groups defined either by IPSS (low and intermediate-1, 69.3 months vs 32.0 months, P = .002; Figure 1B), by World Health Organization classification (RA, RARS, refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, with or without ring sideroblasts, 93.0 months vs 28.7 months, P = .001; Figure 1D), or by FAB classification (RA and RARS, 87.4 months vs 28.7 months, P = .001; Figure 1F).
Train_Line_7875 MECHANISM OF ONCOGENIC KIT ACTIVATION.
Train_Line_7876 SOCS1 expression was raised in myeloproliferative disorder granulocytes but the level was independent of JAK2 V617F status.
Train_Line_7877 Sequences were aligned with NCBI RefSeq sequences using Mutation Surveyor (SoftGenetics), and variants were compared to the UCSC and NCBI SNP databases for novelty.
Train_Line_7878 Whole-exome analysis.
Train_Line_7879 The statistical significance of functional studies was evaluated using a two-tailed t test.
Train_Line_7880 It is also important to note that other JAK2V617F-positive MPN (or MDS/MPN) can mimic ET in their presentation; these include prefibrotic PMF and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T).
Train_Line_7881 Functional category enrichment analyses indicated that Setd2 deficiency activates gene expression in mTOR and Jak-Stat signaling pathways (Supplementary Fig. 15), which are known to contribute directly to leukemogenesis.
Train_Line_7882 In addition, expression of JAK2V617F in a murine bone marrow transplant assay results in a MPD most similar to PV.
Train_Line_7883 These cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 10% FBS.
Train_Line_7884 With or without ringed sideroblasts.
Train_Line_7885 ASXL1 was shown to interact with HP1a, LSD1, SRC1, and RARa in in vitro assays in non-hematopoietic contexts.
Train_Line_7886 Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc) as previously described and expanded in supplemental Methods.
Train_Line_7887 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_7888 Significance was determined at a two-sided a level of 0.05, except for p values in multiple comparisons, in which Bonferroni correction was applied.
Train_Line_7889 It should be noted that the RARS category is present as a favorable variable in the WPSS; therefore, the close association of RARS with SF3B1 mutations reduces the independent predictive power of the latter in a multivariable Cox model that includes both variables.
Train_Line_7890 The pcDNA3.1/V5 human SH2B3 vector and SH2B3 RE were previously described (Gery et al 2007; Gueller et al 2008).
Train_Line_7891 Comprehensive Mutational Profiling for Risk Stratification and Clinical Management of AML.
Train_Line_7892 Hemoglobin levels were significantly lower (median: 9 vs 10.1 g/dL; P < .001), while white blood cell counts (WBC; P = .001) and platelets (P < .001) were higher in SF3B1-mut compared with SF3B1-wt patients.
Train_Line_7893 Cells without primary antibody served as negative controls.
Train_Line_7894 The activation of ERK2 in response to EGF stimulation was sustained in cells expressing the E76K SHP-2 protein (Fig. 1c) as well as the D61Y and N308D SHP-2 mutants (data not shown), suggesting that the increased cell proliferation may be attributable, at least in part, to ligand-dependent prolonged activation of the RAS/MAPK cascade.
Train_Line_7895 FLT3 ITD and FLT3 TKD mutations were present in 8 (62%) and 5 patients (38%), respectively There were no significant differences in demographic and disease characteristics among CMML patients with and without FLT3 mutations.
Train_Line_7896 Abbreviation: HR, hazard ratio.
Train_Line_7897 We therefore included 288 samples from patients with lower-IPSS-risk MDS in this study (Data Supplement).
Train_Line_7898 Nontumoral DNA was available in 10 of the 15 patients with BCOR mutations, and the somatic nature of the mutations was confirmed in all 10 cases by direct sequencing.
Train_Line_7899 Table 2. Clinical correlative studies of ASXL1 mutations in patients with AML.
Train_Line_7900 The mutations occurred in all MDS FAB subtypes (excluding CMML, which was not examined) as well as IPSS scores ranging from 0-3.
Train_Line_7901 Corresponding accession numbers, primer sequences and PCR amplification protocols are listed in supplemental Tables 4 through 9.
Train_Line_7902 qPCR reactions were carried out in an ABI 7900 HT Sequence Detection System using the FastStart Taqman qPCR mastermix according to the manufacturers' instructions (Roche).
Train_Line_7903 Hence, to ascertain the exact frequency/type of mutations, significance of low level clones and effect of 5-azacitidine on TP53 mutant clone, we have used next generation pyrosequencing and high-resolution SNP array karyotyping in 318 and 116 MDS patients respectively.
Train_Line_7904 The mutation is present in granulocytes but not in non-hematopoietic germline DNA, demonstrating that MPLW515L is a somatic mutation present in clonally derived hematopoietic cells. Moreover, the MPLW515L allele was not observed in a panel of normal individuals, demonstrating that it is not a common single nucleotide polymorphism.
Train_Line_7905 Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a viable option for some patients with MF, but most patients are diagnosed at an advanced age and are not candidates for stem cell transplantation.
Train_Line_7906 Finally, hypermethylation of SOCS3 promoter has been demonstrated in a number of malignancies.
Train_Line_7907 We also found missense defects in PTPN11 in two unrelated individuals with growth retardation, pulmonic stenosis and JMML: the 218C>T transition and a defect in exon 13 affecting the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain.
Train_Line_7908 The WPSS risk group was strongly associated with OS (Table 3), whereas the significance of SF3B1 mutation status as an independent predictor of favorable outcome was borderline (P = .05).
Train_Line_7909 We must therefore assume that the somatic mutation responsible for gain of function at the stem cell level involves loss-of-function at the hematopoietic precursor level (Figure 2, step 3).
Train_Line_7910 These data suggest that Setd2 downregulation enhances the leukemogenic potential of pre-leukemic cells by activation of multiple pathways, as exemplified by the mTOR signaling pathway.
Train_Line_7911 Such mutations have been termed "class I "mutations to distinguish such mediators of activated cellular growth signal from "class II" mutations in key regulatory elements involved in differentiation, often leading towards a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) phenotype.
Train_Line_7912 ASXL1 mutation was closely associated with trisomy 8 and mutations of RUNX1, EZH2, IDH, NRAS, JAK2, SETBP1 and SRSF2, but was negatively associated with SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_7913 Mutations of PTPN11 are rare in adult myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_7914 Most of these mutations are present in a heterozygous state and cause a frameshift to a specific alternative reading frame.
Train_Line_7915 Such observations were further validated by a recent population-based study of 327 patients with PV where multivariate analysis identified age >70 years, leucocyte count >13 x 10(9)/L and thrombosis at diagnosis, as risk factors for poor survival.
Train_Line_7916 The results favored busulfan in terms of both first remission duration (median, 4 years vs. 2 years) and overall survival (10-year survival rates of 70% vs. 55%).
Train_Line_7917 5.3 Standardized reporting system for genetic abnormalities.
Train_Line_7918 Prognostic impact of IDH1 mutations.
Train_Line_7919 Figure 2. Bone marrow morphology demonstrating both dysplastic and proliferative features in a JAK V617F negative patient (n. 511; A-D) and a patient with the mutation (n. 510; E-I). Ringed sideroblastosis (A,E) associated with immaturity, megaloblastoid changes and abnormal nuclear budding (arrows) and binuclearity (asterix) of erythroblasts (B,C,F,G). Dysgranulopoiesis with numerous hypogranular (arrowheads) myeloid cells (B,F,G; Pappenheim's stain). Evidence of both small megakaryocytes with round nuclei and mature cytoplasm (C,H) and large multinucleated forms (D, I). A, E, Perls' stain; B-D, F-I, Pappenheim's stain; x 1000.
Train_Line_7920 Anecdotal reports suggest a role for the use of recombinant human activated factor VII in the treatment of bleeding in AML patients refractory to platelet transfusions; however, well-designed clinical trials are lacking.
Train_Line_7921 Sequential biopsies revealed an evolution to a higher fibrosis score in four patients, including one with a marked increase in fiber density (score 3), while no change in fibrosis was noted in three cases (Table 1).
Train_Line_7922 All assays were performed a minimum of three times in triplicate.
Train_Line_7923 OS was defined as the time from presentation to the MDACC leukemia service to death from any cause or the last follow-up.
Train_Line_7924 Genomic regions of interest were amplified by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Train_Line_7925 This observation fits well into the p53 pathomechanism of genomic instability.
Train_Line_7926 Treatment of 32D MPLW515L or 32D MPLWT cells but not 32D FIP1L1-PDGFRA cells with a small molecule JAK kinase inhibitor resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth (Figure 7A).
Train_Line_7927 However, the median leukemia-free survival is >10 years in the former vs <2 years in the latter.
Train_Line_7928 However, the prognostic significance of TET2 mutations remains unclear, with some studies suggesting favorable prognosis, whereas others show no significant contribution to survival in MDS.
Train_Line_7929 Both IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. Abbreviations: IPSS, international prognostic scoring system; IPSS-R, revised IPSS.
Train_Line_7930 These independent experiments reduce sampling errors for RMA calculations owing to a higher combined sequencing coverage.
Train_Line_7931 Earlier studies of the prognostic significance of mutations in RAS in AML have yielded contradictory results.
Train_Line_7932 In one of the very few controlled studies in ET, Cortelazzo et al. randomized 114 mostly high-risk patients to hydroxyurea (n = 56) or not (n = 58).

Train_Line_7934 In line with these data, an AML case of UPD on chromosome 19 with a homozygous C-terminal C/EBPalpha mutation has been reported.
Train_Line_7935 However, molecular genetic information is not routinely used to predict outcome for patients with MDS undergoing HSCT.
Train_Line_7936 In MDSs, ASXL1 mutations are more frequent in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) than in the other forms such as refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS).
Train_Line_7937 The somatic nature of these mutations was confirmed by Sanger and targeted deep DNA sequencing (Figure 1).
Train_Line_7938 Risk-Adapted Therapy.
Train_Line_7939 A bone marrow blast count of 4% or greater was associated with mutations in SRSF2, ASXL1, RUNX1, NRAS, and CBL (P < .005 for each comparison), and mutations in U2AF1, ASXL1, RUNX1, and NRAS were associated with a platelet count of less than 50 x 109/L (P < .01 for each comparison).
Train_Line_7940 SRSF2 mutations were associated with a negative prognostic impact in our study.
Train_Line_7941 ABSTRACT.
Train_Line_7942 Association of IDH mutations with cytogenetics and other molecular gene mutations.
Train_Line_7943 Genomic DNA was obtained from bone marrow mononuclear cells, peripheral-blood granulocytes, or whole-blood samples.
Train_Line_7944 Only half of these genes are within the 20 most recurrently mutated ones in MDS (Table 3).
Train_Line_7945 Including race or ethnicity, family history, prior exposure to toxic agents, prior malignancy, therapy for prior malignancy, information on smoking.
Train_Line_7946 It has been suggested that RARS-T might also develop from a JAK2 (V617F)-mutated MPN through the acquisition of an SF3B1 mutation.
Train_Line_7947 Deep sequencing analysis of clonal architecture in serial samples indicated that BRCC3 mutations may constitute founder events, and Brcc3 knockdown in murine LSK cells resulted in approximately doubling clonogenic cells and modest differentiation block of hematopoietic progenitors transfected with Brcc3 shRNA.
Train_Line_7948 Moreover, C/EBPalpha mutations are confined to AML and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and have not been found in other diseases.
Train_Line_7949 At least 150 reads were generated for each amplicon.
Train_Line_7950 All tests were two-tailed and a P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Train_Line_7951 Even then, it is important to remember that leukemic transformation in PV or ET usually arises from JAK2V617F-negative progenitors and that the presence of JAK2V617F might actually be protective against fibrotic progression.
Train_Line_7952 It has been shown that depletion of SRSF2 results in genomic instability; triggering significant double stranded DNA breaks.
Train_Line_7953 WBC indicates white blood cells; Hb, hemoglobin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; RAEBT, refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation; RCUD, refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia; and RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia.
Train_Line_7954 After publication of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 8525 treatment trial, multicycle high-dose cytarabine has become preferential postinduction chemotherapy for patients not receiving SCT.
Train_Line_7955 Cytogenetic analysis was performed by G- and R-banding analysis.
Train_Line_7956 The coding region and splice sites of SOCS1 and SOCS3 were assessed for acquired mutations.
Train_Line_7957 Figure 1. Mapping of 168 TP53 mutations in 141 CK-AMLs. Hemizygous mutations are indicated in the bottom panel, heterozygous, and/or homozygous mutations are marked in the top panel. Exons 4 to 10 are drawn to relative scale; missense mutations (green), nonsense mutations (red), and insertion/deletion mutations (blue) are shown at their approximate location along the exons. Bold represents homozygous mutations, and blue italics, frameshift mutations leading to a premature stop codon.
Train_Line_7958 In general, the prognosis of patients after relapse is poor and treatment options unsatisfactory.
Train_Line_7959 All mutations appeared to be heterozygous substitutions clustered in exons 12-16 of the gene.
Train_Line_7960 Presently, c-CBL seems to be involved more in progression toward myelofibrosis or acute leukemia than in the chronic phase of the disorder, but further studies are required to establish its precise role.
Train_Line_7961 They did not meet the WHO histological criteria for RARS-thrombocytosis.
Train_Line_7962 RESULTS.
Train_Line_7963 The discovery of JAK2V617F mutation is an important breakthrough in the understanding of BCR-ABL-negative MPN and has demonstrated the role of pathologic signaling by the JAK/STAT pathway in MPN.
Train_Line_7964 Prognostic impact of U2AF1 mutation on overall survival and leukemic transformation.
Train_Line_7965 In order to better understand the effects of the GATA2 mutants on gene expression, we performed microarray analysis to compare global gene expression in HL-60 cells expressing wild-type GATA2 and the three GATA2 mutants (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 8).
Train_Line_7966 The 2-sided level of significance was set at P < .05.
Train_Line_7967 Sequencing of JAK2 V617F negative patients revealed that somatic missense, deletions, and insertions, largely in exon 12, account for nearly all of the remaining PV patients.
Train_Line_7968 In contrast to Graubert et al whose analysis of 150 MDS patients suggested an increased probability of secondary AML progression for patients with U2AF35 mutation, subsequent studies could not confirm this observation.
Train_Line_7969 In this report we describe a somatic mutation in the transmembrane region of MPL (MPLW515L) in a subset of JAK2V617F-negative MF.
Train_Line_7970 Recently, Oh et al identified 2 mutations in LNK exon 2, one in a patient with PMF and the other with ET; both MPNs were JAK2V617F negative.
Train_Line_7971 Reliable molecular markers -- like those currently being established for AML -- are still missing for patients with MDS.
Train_Line_7972 CSF3R encodes the receptor for colony stimulating factor 3.
Train_Line_7973 Steffen Koschmieder; Balazs Halmos; Elena Levantini; Daniel G. Tenen.
Train_Line_7974 After the discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in spliceosome complex genes in a significant proportion of adult MDS patients by whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing studies, it is of interest to known whether there are distinct clinical and biological features in the patients harboring these mutations.
Train_Line_7975 Allele-specific polymerase chain reaction was also used to screen for MPL-W515 mutations.
Train_Line_7976 Oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer3 program.

(A) Point and frameshift mutations considered: OS in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with mutated (n = 34) and unmutated ASXL1 (n = 120). (B) Only frameshift mutations considered: OS in patients with MDS with mutated (n = 24) and unmutated (n = 130) ASXL1.

(D) Only frameshift mutations considered: time to AML transformation for patients with MDS with mutated (n = 24) and unmutated ASXL1 (n = 124). Genes in patients with ASXL1 point mutations are considered WT in this analysis.

Train_Line_7979 In a nonrandomized study by the PVSG, treatment with hydroxyurea was associated with a lower incidence of early thrombosis when compared with a historical cohort treated with phlebotomy alone (6.6% vs. 14% at 2 years).
Train_Line_7980 TET2 is mutated in multiple solid tumor malignancies and a broad spectrum of myeloid diseases including in 10-20% of MPN.
Train_Line_7981 The findings stress the need for inclusion of TP53 mutations in the future MDS scoring systems that incorporate molecular markers of disease.
Train_Line_7982 BCOR interacts with BcL6, and constitutional inactivating mutations of the gene have been described in the oculofacicocardiodental syndrome.
Train_Line_7983 All samples were collected with patient consent under an institutional review board-approved protocol in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Train_Line_7984 Mutations in genes that affect both DNA cytosine modifications and histone posttranslational modifications: IDH1/2 mutations.
Train_Line_7985 Myeloid sarcomas should be evaluated for genetic and phenotypic features that allow for their classification in the appropriate WHO entity.
Train_Line_7986 Samples from 193 patients with MDS and 53 with AML with a prior history of MDS were collected at the time of enrollment in clinical trials.
Train_Line_7987 The p.P242S (c.724C>T) were detected in six patients and was an already known polymorphism (rs78894077) listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Database (dbSNP; http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).
Train_Line_7988 This benefit is attributable to both the high-dose therapy of standard conditioning regimens and a potent graft-versusleukemia (GVL) effect.
Train_Line_7989 MPL mutations cluster in exon 10, the most frequent being MPLW515L/K.
Train_Line_7990 High throughput sequencing of pooled PCR products was performed on the FLX 454, sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (Build 37) with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner, and individual sample sequencing information was deconstructed as previously described.
Train_Line_7991 Template preparation was performed with the OneTouch System v37 (Life Technologies).
Train_Line_7992 Most patients (23 of 32, 72%) with WT1 mutations showed concurrent mutations of other genes, more frequently class 2 (16 of 23), but also class 1 mutations (13 of 23, Table 4).
Train_Line_7993 There was lack of similar strong correlation between mutations and chromosome 7 alterations, as none with isolated -7/7q- had TP53 mutation, which is a novel finding.
Train_Line_7994 Variables considered for inclusion in the model were karyotype (favorable versus intermediate risk versus high risk), IPSS (low/int-1 versus int-2/high), transfusion dependence (yes versus no), ferritin level (above or below 1000 mg/L), age (below versus above median), number of therapies (best supportive care versus at least one other treatment), and IDH1 mutation status.
Train_Line_7995 We had follow-up samples available for 24 patients with mutated CALR; all these follow-up samples tested positive for the mutation as well.
Train_Line_7996 Recurrent DNMT3A Mutations in Patients with Myelodysplastic Syndromes.
Train_Line_7997 Bleeding diathesis in ET or PV is currently believed to be multifactorial in etiology.
Train_Line_7998 The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) randomized 293 patients between 1967 and 1978 to treatment with either radiophosphorus or oral busulfan.
Train_Line_7999 Interestingly, as shown in Table 4, a molecular classification appears to be already feasible in MDS/MPN,a group of myeloid neoplasms thus far defined on the basis of cumbersome clinical, hematologic, and morphologic criteria.
Train_Line_8000 The data clearly showed that p.Thr355del and p.Thr354Met are almost total loss-of-function mutants (Supplementary Fig. 8).
Train_Line_8001 C/EBPalpha can regulate the expression of a number of lung-specific genes, such as Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP), surfactant protein A (SP-A), and surfactant protein D (SPD).
Train_Line_8002 Among the 192 patients with low/Int-1 IPSS scores, there was no difference in OS between patients with or without TET2 mutations (median OS: 52 months; 95% CI: 30.9-69.1 vs 65.0 months; 95% CI: 41.9.0-90.3; P = .33).
Train_Line_8003 Sequential study during the clinical course showed ASXL1-mutated patients retained the original ASXL1 mutation, but frequently acquired other novel genetic alterations during disease evolution.
Train_Line_8004 Massive parallel sequencing has the potential of dramatically improving our approach to diagnosis of MDS as illustrated in Figure 4.
Train_Line_8005 We applied amplicon deep-sequencing to investigate the complete coding region of 4 candidate genes that had been identified by WES analysis: DNMT3A, BCOR, SSRP1, and YY2.
Train_Line_8006 Improved identification of genomic defects has substantiated the view that clinical disease heterogeneity is related to patho-molecular diversity.
Train_Line_8007 The prognostic impact of BCOR mutations was evaluated in French MDS patients for whom follow-up information was available (n = 209).
Train_Line_8008 Supplemental Information includes Supplemental Experimental Procedures, seven figures, and six tables and can be found with this article online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2015.03.017.
Train_Line_8009 Approximately one-third of these patients (n = 113) were classified as having AML under current WHO criteria (blast counts 20%-30%).
Train_Line_8010 The discovery of this mutation provides a novel mechanism for activation of signal transduction in hematopoietic malignancies.
Train_Line_8011 Although far more common in AML, DNMT3A mutations have been reported in 7-15% of MPN patients.
Train_Line_8012 The sensitivity of this assay is approximately 0.2% of mutant alleles.
Train_Line_8013 The lack of anti-thrombotic value from anti-platelet agents in the above-mentioned PVSG-aspirin study may have been influenced by the fact that 27% of the patients randomized to the phlebotomy-aspirin-dipyridamole arm had a prior history of thrombosis when compared with 13% in the other arm.
Train_Line_8014 In our cohort, 72 patients reached this milestone.
Train_Line_8015 Two-group comparisons were performed by Mann-Whitney test for continuous and by 2-sided Fisher's exact or x2 tests for categorical variables.
Train_Line_8016 Conversely, other mutations involving TET2, IDH, ASXL1, or DNMT3A are occasionally seen in PV and ET.
Train_Line_8017 D816V and N822K are primary activating mutations which may confer secondary imatinib resistance by mechanisms similar to those responsible for primary resistance as described above.
Train_Line_8018 A total of 125 patients with MDS who underwent a first allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral-blood HSCT at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 2004 to 2009 were considered for inclusion in this study.
Train_Line_8019 These features conform to those characteristics of a loss-of-function mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene.
Train_Line_8020 Through further search (Table 1), we identified an additional three cases with advanced MDS and a strong family history of MDS/AML (families 5-7) who harbored DDX41 alterations; two of them showed both germline and somatic mutations of DDX41 (Figure S2B).
Train_Line_8021 Mutated Genes Associated With Differences in Overall Survival.
Train_Line_8022 In addition to harboring C/EBPalpha mutations, the C/EBPalpha gene as well as other C/EBP members have been demonstrated to be involved in t(14;19)(q32;q13) chromosomal translocations in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BP-ALL).
Train_Line_8023 The same were also true if the analyses were performed on the 171 MDS patients based on WHO classification (P = .007 for sexes and P < .001 for age, respectively; data not shown).
Train_Line_8024 ASXL1 role could be to recruit the PRC2 complex to known leukemogenic loci such as HOXA genes.
Train_Line_8025 Membranes were probed with antibodies using standard techniques and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence plus detection reagents (Amersham) on X-ray film (Amersham Hyperfilm MP).
Train_Line_8026 JAK2 and either SH2B3 WT or mutants were co-expressed in 293T cells and protein lysates were immunoprecipitated with a SH2B3 antibody and western blotted with a JAK2 antibody.
Train_Line_8027 The independent poor risk factors for RFS included unfavorable karyotype and WT1 mutation.
Train_Line_8028 CONCLUSIONS.
Train_Line_8029 Activating KIT mutations and amplifications have been demonstrated in melanoma at relatively low frequency (approximately 5%) and mostly in those occurring at accral, mucosal or chronic sun damaged sites.
Train_Line_8030 In a phase 3 randomized trial, azacitidine prolonged OS compared with conventional care regimens in patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MDS.
Train_Line_8031 A cohort of 430 patients including 354 MDS (including the MDS index patient), 54 CMML, and 22 AML-MRC was included in this study.
Train_Line_8032 The shorter form, known as p30, contains the same carboxyl terminus as the full-length form, known as p42, but lacks the amino-terminal 117 amino acids.
Train_Line_8033 Among the 171 patients with MDS according to WHO classification, (11.7%) showed SRSF2 mutation.
Train_Line_8034 Finally, recent data suggests that it might not be inappropriate to withhold cytoreductive drugs in older patients with ET (age >60 years) in the absence of both JAK2V617F and cardiovascular risk factors.
Train_Line_8035 Furthermore, SF3B1 mutations are independent predictors of favorable clinical outcome, and their incorporation into stratification systems might improve risk assessment in MDS.
Train_Line_8036 Together, at least 117 of 164 (71%) TP53-altered CK-AMLs had biallelic TP53 inactivation (not taken into account the 4 patients with potentially compound heterozygous TP53 mutations).
Train_Line_8037 Genomic DNA was amplified using a whole-genome amplification kit following the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma-Aldrich).
Train_Line_8038 In contrast, recent studies have suggested a greater than 50% response rate in PV-associated pruritus treated with paroxetine (20 mg/day), which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
Train_Line_8039 However, this latter progression appears to be relatively unlikely, and this is particularly true with respect to progression from RARS to AML.
Train_Line_8040 The close association between SF3B1 mutations and disease phenotype with ring sideroblasts across MDS and MDS/MPN is consistent with a causal relationship.
Train_Line_8041 Most patients with DNMT3A mutations had at least one mutation in the methyltransferase domain (n = 80, 92%).
Train_Line_8042 Several agents targeting PI3K or its downstream effectors AKT and mTOR are currently under evaluation.

Train_Line_8044 Personal hygiene, dental care, and vigorous hand washing (the latter also for family and caregivers) are very important for prevention of infections.
Train_Line_8045 Recent large studies in CBF AML indicate that around 37% of adult cases and 19% of paediatric cases had KIT mutations.
Train_Line_8046 Figure 2. Repartition of BCOR and other mutations by targeted deep resequencing. For each gene, the percentage is representing the estimated number of cells carrying the unique mutation. All UPN are MDS cases.
Train_Line_8047 In a recent work, Kon et al detected mutations and deletions involving various genes of the cohesin complex (STAG2, RAD21, SMC1A, and SMC3) in 8% of patients with MDS, 10% of those with CMML, and 12% of those with AML.
Train_Line_8048 This emerging nuclear role of mutated JAK2 may reveal mutant-specific chromatin effects that may open a novel therapeutic window.
Train_Line_8049 SBB staining parallels MPO but is less specific.
Train_Line_8050 Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent importance of BCOR mutations for OS.
Train_Line_8051 All the patients were genotyped for the JAK2 V617F mutation.
Train_Line_8052 DDX41 mutations and deletions occurred more frequently in patients with advanced MDS (19% in advanced MDS versus 6% in low-risk MDS; p = 0.02; Figures 3A and 3B) and with AML (12% of primary, n = 302; and 13% of secondary AML, n = 154).
Train_Line_8053 Neither they nor their spontaneously transformed variants were sensitive to imatinib.
Train_Line_8054 In multivariate analysis (Table 6), the independent poor risk factors for OS were age more than 50 years, WBC count more than 50 000/muL, unfavorable karyotype, and WT1 mutation.
Train_Line_8055 A 67-year-old female patient presented with pancytopenia (WBC, 2540/muL; hemoglobin, 7.4 g/dL; and platelets, 78 000/muL).
Train_Line_8056 Wild-type or mutant GATA2 was PCR amplified from the above pCMV6-XL6 plasmid vectors using the primers (KOZAK-GATA2-F and either GATA2-FLAG-R or GATA2-R) (Supplementary Table 12) and Pfu Turbo (Stratagene), excised with XbaI and cloned into the unique XbaI site of 5xUAS.
Train_Line_8057 At the same time, conditional expression of Idh1R132H using either system resulted in an age-dependent splenomegaly due to extramedullary hematopoiesis and a coincident development of a hypocellular bone marrow compared with age-matched wild-type counterparts.
Train_Line_8058 By comparison, spleens from MPLWT animals displayed a relative preservation of normal splenic architecture with only a mild expansion of red pulp by maturing erythroid elements (Figure 4F and 4H) that were also noted in small, focal clusters in the livers of these animals (Figure 4J and 4L).
Train_Line_8059 PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS IN RELATION TO ASXL1.
Train_Line_8060 In CK-AML, TP53 alteration represents the most important prognostic marker, even outweighing the MK category in multivariable analysis.
Train_Line_8061 IPSS, Higher group: intermediate 2 and high risk; Lower group, low and intermediate 1 risk.
Train_Line_8062 JAK2 V617F status did not significantly affect SOCS1 expression in MPD and, unlike for SOCS3, transformation to myelofibrosis resulted in normalization of SOCS1 transcript level.
Train_Line_8063 The epidemiologic and clinical features of FLT3 mutations in MDS and CMML are less known.
Train_Line_8064 In another, more recent model of conditional Asxl1 gene knock-out, the animals developed a strong hematopoietic phenotype consistent with an MDS with myeloproliferative features.
Train_Line_8065 Algorithm sensitivity (proportion of true variants identified) was inferred by considering the variants called by the algorithm at known single nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP) sites using an error P value cutoff of at most 1 x 10-6 for a variant in both the tumor and normal sample, which produced 13385 known SNPs.
Train_Line_8066 The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations.
Train_Line_8067 Together with disease segregation data, this indicates that the GATA2 p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del variants are the predisposing variations in these families with familial MDS-AML.
Train_Line_8068 Estimated probabilities for survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test evaluated differences between survival distributions.
Train_Line_8069 If such a donor is not available, an alternative donor can be considered, that is, an umbilical cord blood unit, or a haploidentical donor.
Train_Line_8070 However, the number of patients with U2AF1 mutations was small, so the result requires confirmation in a larger patient cohort.
Train_Line_8071 This may be at least partially related to the heterogeneity of investigated cohorts: our study cohort includes a lower number of refractory anemia with RSs (RARS)/refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD)-RS or RARS-T patients compared with others (19% vs 29%) and a higher number of advanced MDS or RAEB-1 or RAEB-2 subtypes (45% vs 26%).
Train_Line_8072 TP53 mutations are not associated with the chronic phase of MPNs.
Train_Line_8073 The adjusted HRs fell to 1.56 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.26) for ASXL1 mutations and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.61) for RUNX1 mutations.
Train_Line_8074 Relapse-free and disease-free survival have been used with the same definition
Train_Line_8075 The precise role of WT1 in leukemogenesis remains to be defined.
Train_Line_8076 Once the myelodysplastic clone has become fully dominant in the bone marrow, the disease may or may not become clinically apparent.
Train_Line_8077 PCR product sizes, primer sequences and location relative to the 5' end of the mRNA were: SOCS1 (NM_003745): 92 bp; SOCS1-F, 5'TGGTAGCACACAACCAGGTG3', nt 156; SOCS1-R, 5'GAGGAGGAAGAGGAGGAAGG3', nt 247; SOCS3 (NM_003955): 110 bp; SOCS3-F, 5'CAAGGACGGAGACTTCGATT3', nt 300; SOCS3-R, 5'-GGAGCCAGCGTGGATCTG3', nt 409; ABL (NM_005157): 118 bp; ABL-F, 5'GCGTGAGAGTGAGAGCAG3', nt 456; ABL-R, 5'CTCTCGGAGGAGACGTAG3', nt 573.
Train_Line_8078 First, the identification of the mutant gene responsible for the initial clone is relevant to clinical outcome.
Train_Line_8079 Targeting synergising oncogenes with small molecule inhibitors appears to be a promising approach although some of these inhibitors have a broad activity spectrum and combinations may cause unacceptable toxicity.
Train_Line_8080 Somatic mutation: A mutation that occurs in a non-germ cell of a body after conception (the ancient Greek somatikos means "of the body").
Train_Line_8081 We have shown that consideration of mutations in several genes can refine the prognosis of patients with MDS compared with the IPSS alone.
Train_Line_8082 To examine the prevalence of SETD2 mutations in a general population of patients with leukemia, we next used PCR to amplify all 21 exons of SETD2 and carried out Sanger sequencing on 134 AML and 107 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples (Supplementary Tables 3-6).
Train_Line_8083 Refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) was recently shown to be a JAK2V617F mutation-related disorder.
Train_Line_8084 Clinical and hematologic data were recorded following informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki; this study was approved by institutional review boards of Paris Centre, Marseille, and the University of Tokyo.
Train_Line_8085 This approach offers particular promise in cancers involving D816 mutations which are highly resistant to commonly used KIT kinase inhibitors.
Train_Line_8086 P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Train_Line_8087 Table 2. Recent studies on the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in patients with MDS.
Train_Line_8088 Identification of recurrent BCOR mutations in AML.
Train_Line_8089 The libraries were sequenced with the use of a HiSeq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina).
Train_Line_8090 Follow-up samples were available for 35 patients (median follow-up, 226 days; range, 13-988 days).
Train_Line_8091 Patients with the genotype ZRSR2-mut/TET2-wt had a shorter OS (HR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.01-4.85; P = .042) and tended to have a higher rate for AML transformation (HR = 2.4; 95% CI, 0.94-6.81; P = .077; Figure 4E-F) compared with all other genotypes.
Train_Line_8092 We found that intensification of the dose of anthracycline markedly improved the outcomes in patients with mutations in DNMT3A or NPM1 or with MLL translocations, suggesting that mutational profiling can be used to determine which patients will benefit from dose-intensive induction therapy (Fig. 5B).
Train_Line_8093 Additionally, activating mutations in FLT3 are observed in ~30% of adult AML patients.
Train_Line_8094 We identified 19 somatic SETD2 mutations in 15 patients (Fig. 2 and Table 1).
Train_Line_8095 Dose reduction may be considered for individual patients.
Train_Line_8096 Jung-Sook Ha; Dong-Seok Jeon.
Train_Line_8097 Although clonal hematopoiesis was observed in these disorders more than three decades ago, the molecular etiology of these disorders was not known until recently when several groups reported a somatic mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2V617F) in most patients with PV and in a subset of patients with ET and MF.
Train_Line_8098 After electrophoresis, the fluorescence signals were analyzed using GeneScan, Volume 3.1 software (Applied Biosystems).
Train_Line_8099 PCR fragments were directly sequenced, and were analyzed using Sequencing Analysis 5.3.1 software (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and Vector NTI Advance 10 software (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).
Train_Line_8100 In the first mutation, the capacity to inhibit TPO signaling is lost, whereas in the second mutation, some inhibitory function is maintained.
Train_Line_8101 The IDH mutations in all these patients were heterozygous.
Train_Line_8102 These symptoms are believed to stem from small vessel-based abnormal platelet-endothelial interactions.
Train_Line_8103 Patients with this mutation had a significantly inferior OS and a more rapid and more frequent progression to AML.
Train_Line_8104 For 2 common SNPs (rs34402524 and rs2454206), the respective heterozygous SNP sequence frequency (mean += SD) was 47.8% += 2.54% and 48.5% += 2.18% within the first 96 patient samples, indicating the RMA estimates were accurate.
Train_Line_8105 Genomic DNA was analyzed for NPM1 mutations as previously described.
Train_Line_8106 The advent of next generation sequencing technology has led to the identification of molecular aberrations in ~90% of patients with CMML.
Train_Line_8107 Among 233 patients, 72 were females and 161, males, with a median age of 66 years (range, 18-95 years).
Train_Line_8108 In the current study, we show that SF3B1 is the first mutated gene in MDS to be strongly associated with a specific disease phenotype (ie, ring sideroblasts).
Train_Line_8109 Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate independent prognostic factors for OS.
Train_Line_8110 Inactivating somatic mutations of BCOR have been described in AML with normal karyotype and more recently in a subset of patients with MDS.
Train_Line_8111 Most of the patients with no clonal markers were clustered in the subgroup of patients with essential thrombocythemia.
Train_Line_8112 TA cloning analysis.
Train_Line_8113 Variables considered for model inclusion were International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk group, age, sex, and gene mutation status.
Train_Line_8114 4.7 Biobanking.
Train_Line_8115 TABLE I. Comparison of the Clinical and Laboratory Features Between MDS Patients With and Without U2AF1 Mutation.
Train_Line_8116 No significant difference was found among different types of mutations as regards WHO subgroup, clinical features, or hematologic parameters.
Train_Line_8117 MDS patients were enrolled in multicenter treatment trials investigating the use of all-trans retinoic acid, antithymocyte globulin (NCT00004208), deferasirox, lenalidomide, or thalidomide for the treatment of MDS; demethylating agents were not used for this patient cohort.
Train_Line_8118 Overall survival and the risk of thrombosis were analyzed only among patients carrying a mutation in JAK2, MPL, or CALR (i.e., patients with a clonal marker).
Train_Line_8119 The stability of TP53 mutations was also analysed in sequential samples.
Train_Line_8120 Studies of GIST cell lines indicate that many cells become quiescent rather than undergoing apoptosis when treated with imatinib and can resume proliferation when the drug is withdrawn.
Train_Line_8121 The success of imatinib and sunitinib in GIST is largely due to the scarcity of these mutants, in contrast to SM in particular.
Train_Line_8122 In addition, PHF6 and ASXL1 mutations were associated with reduced overall survival (P = 0.006 for PHF6 and P = 0.05 for ASXL1) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Train_Line_8126 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_8127 Patients with PML-RARA or t(15;17) positive AML were excluded from these trials.
Train_Line_8128 Nonmyeloablative or RIC regimens have been developed to reduce TRM in older or medically less fit patients.
Train_Line_8129 Our analysis demonstrates that frameshift mutations, but not point mutations, have an independent prognostic effect in patients with MDS.
Train_Line_8130 CN-AML patients harboring internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the FLT3 gene have an inferior outcome compared with cases without FLT3-ITD.
Train_Line_8131 Nonetheless, the limited data suggest that patients should receive an antimold agent, rather than fluconazole, during remission induction therapy.
Train_Line_8132 Four canonical mutations occurred in exon 1 (p.Q7X), 3 in exon 4 (p.R81X) and 2 in exon 5 (p.W120X).
Train_Line_8133 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) in MDS led to the discovery of relevant somatic mutations and their combinations (Patel et al, 2012; Walter et al, 2013).
Train_Line_8134 At last follow-up, there were 170 deaths in the cohort, with 33 deaths being from the group of 55 patients with TET2 mutations.
Train_Line_8135 Expression analysis of BCOR mRNA transcript levels.
Train_Line_8136 In a series of secondary AML with multilineage dysplasia we found that in cases resulting from a transformation of a known MDS the same ASXL1 mutation was present at both the chronic and acute stages (Devillier et al, submitted).
Train_Line_8137 Key words: PTPN11, SHP2, somatic mutation, adult, myeloid malignancies.
Train_Line_8138 Subgroup analysis showed that U2AF1 mutation was significantly associated with inferior OS (median 41.6 vs. 185.5 months, P = 0.030, Fig. 2B) in younger patients (<50 years), among whom U2AF1 mutation was more prevalent, but not in older patients (P = 0.813, Fig. 2C).
Train_Line_8139 More recently, IPI-504, a 17-AAG derivative with greater solubility and improved pharmacological characteristics, has been tested in xenograft models of GIST with exon 11 or 13 KIT mutations.
Train_Line_8140 TABLE III. Cox Regression Analysis for the Overall Survival in 478 MDS Patients.
Train_Line_8141 TET2 mutations are not responsible for the familial MPNs identified to date, although a germline mutation has been described.
Train_Line_8142 We cannot be sure if LNK mutations and consequent functional disruption are solely responsible or only provide a supportive role for MPN pathogenesis by other genetic changes like JAK2 V617F.
Train_Line_8143 CMML-1, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-1; SF3B1, splicing factor 3B, subunit 1; SRSF2, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 2; U2AF35, U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1.
Train_Line_8144 Disruption of the JMD by mutation is believed to lead to activation of the kinase by removal of this autoinhibition.
Train_Line_8145 KIT mutations were associated with reduced overall survival among patients who were positive for the t(8;21) core-binding-factor alteration (P = 0.006) but not among patients with the inv(16)/t(16;16) alteration (P = 0.19) (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_8146 In addition to EZH1 or EZH2, PRC2 includes EED, RbAp46/48, SUZ12,AEBP2, JARID2, and PCL.
Train_Line_8147 Germline control DNA was obtained from immunomagnetically purified circulating T cells.
Train_Line_8148 Another schedule is single agent cytarabine for 6 days (2-3 g/m2 per q12h).
Train_Line_8149 The DO-7 antibody (Novacastro Inc., Newcastle, UK) was used that recognized both wild-type and mutant TP53 protein.
Train_Line_8150 RAS proteins are membrane-associated GTPases that in their active form trigger a variety of effector signaling pathways, such as the MAPK cascade of serine/threonine kinases.
Train_Line_8151 Small to large megakaryocytes with aberrant nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and hyperchromatic and irregularly folded nuclei and dense clustering.
Train_Line_8152 RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF SF3B1 MUTATION STATUS TO OS AS PREDICTED BY IPSS OR WPSS.
Train_Line_8153 To maximally increase the chance of identifying novel genetic lesions, we selected a patient with CN-AML for WES who was devoid of NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3-ITD mutations and of MLL-PTD, and was subsequently found to be unmutated for IDH1.
Train_Line_8154 Methylation of the SOCS3 promoter and reduced gene expression have been detected in patients with lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and Barrett's adenocarcinoma.

(C) Co-existing mutations in the BRCC3-mutated cohort; 27 out of 28 cases were positive for other somatic mutations.
Train_Line_8156 DDX41 defects were associated with more avid exon skipping (excess of shorter mRNA missing an exon) and more exon retention (excess of longer mRNA incorporating an exon) in 61 and 95 genes, respectively.
Train_Line_8157 His brother also died from AML at the age of 58 years (Figure 1C; Figure S1E).
Train_Line_8158 The AMLCG over 15 years has used 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin with acceptable toxicity.
Train_Line_8159 The clinical response to treatment (MDS IWG 2006 response criteria; Cheson et al, 2006) is also indicated along with UPN, disease subtype as per WHO classification, cytogenetics and 17p status by SNP.

Train_Line_8160 INTRODUCTION.
Train_Line_8161 Third, the number of driver mutations per patient represents an important prognostic factor per se.
Train_Line_8162 Of 367 patients with MDS, FLT3-ITD mutations were identified in eight cases (2.2%), all with an underlying diagnosis of RAEB, and FLT3-TKD mutation was identified in one patient (0.4%).
Train_Line_8163 Furthermore, the mutants inhibited growth of Sh2b3 KO BM cells, albeit to a lesser extent compared with WT SH2B3, which is also consistent with a nondominant negative effect.
Train_Line_8164 Table 3. Univariate and Multivariate Analyses for OS in Patients With MDS and With Mutated or Unmutated ASXL1.
Train_Line_8165 HL-60 promyelocytic cells were cultured in RPMI containing 10% FBS.
Train_Line_8166 This phenotype probably results from increased TPO/MPL signaling because TPO is required for maintaining HSC quiescence and the HSC reservoir.
Train_Line_8167 The prognostic relevance of FLT3-TKD mutations remains controversial.
Train_Line_8168 In patients with a CNS recurrence, craniospinal irradiation with or without intrathecal chemotherapy has also been shown to be effective; however, its impact on long-term outcome is unknown.
Train_Line_8169 The overall scenario is similar in PV and concerns about drug leukemogenicity involving hydroxyurea or busulfan are largely based on rumors rather facts.
Train_Line_8170 Some reports have suggested that patients with AML having RAS mutations have worse or similar clinical outcomes than patients carrying wild-type RAS genes, whereas others have found that mutations in RAS are associated with a more favorable prognosis.
Train_Line_8171 DISCUSSION.
Train_Line_8172 After 20 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) using a GloMax-Multi Detection System (Promega).
Train_Line_8173 No aberrations in the mutational hotspots of SRSF2 (exon 1), U2AF1 (exon 2 and exon 6), or SF3B1 (exons 13-16) were identified in any samples from healthy volunteers (n = 50).
Train_Line_8174 We aimed to determine the clinical implication of WT1 mutation in 470 de novo non-M3 AML patients and its stability during the clinical course.
Train_Line_8175 This reinforces the opinion that RARS-T is a true MDS/MPN at both the clinical and the molecular levels, and should no longer be considered a provisional entity in the WHO classification.
Train_Line_8176 Information is from Swerdlow et al.
Train_Line_8177 Mutations of BCORL1 were screened by deep sequencing of pooled DNA followed by deep sequencing validation, as previously described.
Train_Line_8178 The prognostic relevance of cytogenetic abnormalities has led to the widespread adoption of risk stratification, with patients divided into three cytogenetically defined risk groups with significant differences in overall survival.
Train_Line_8179 For a deeper analysis of this subject, the reader is referred to a comprehensive review article by Liew and Owen.
Train_Line_8180 Additional studies have shown that JAK2 can localize to the nucleus through a yet, unknown mechanism, which results in phosphorylation of H3-Y41 and reduced the binding of the transcriptional silencer HP1alpha.
Train_Line_8181 Among the 15 patients with U2AF1 mutation, 10 patients retained the original mutations in the subsequent samples (Table IV); the other five, who achieved a complete remission after either allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (patients 7, 8, 12, and 13) or intensive chemotherapy (patient 9), lost their original U2AF1 mutation.
Train_Line_8182 No mutations were identified within the coding region of either gene in 73 patients with myeloproliferative disorders. No disease-specific CpG island methylation of SOCS1 was observed.
Train_Line_8183 Mutation Analyses.
Train_Line_8184 Although most of these patients had nonmutated CALR exon 9, a total of 3 patients with RARS-T had mutations in CALR (Fig. 1B), all with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL (Fig. 1C).
Train_Line_8185 Patient Samples.
Train_Line_8186 The mutational hot spots for U2AF35 included S34F in 8 (40%) of the 20 U2AF35-mutated patients, Q157P in 5 (25%), Q157R in 5 (25%), Q157G in 1 (5%), and R158H in 1 (5%) (Table II).
Train_Line_8187 Most frequently, codon R882 located in exon 23 was mutated (n = 58), leading to a change from arginine to histidine (n = 38), cysteine (n = 17), or serine (n = 3).
Train_Line_8188 The results significantly favored treatment with phlebotomy alone with a median survival of 12.6 years when compared with 10.9 and 9.1 years for treatment with radiophosphorus and chlorambucil, respectively.
Train_Line_8189 The prognostic score furnishes a basis for recommendations regarding treatment with curative objectives, or palliative therapy, or therapy in the context of a phase 1/2 study.
Train_Line_8190 These compounds likely alter the interaction between splicing factor 3b and pre-mRNA66 and induce abnormal transcription and alternative splicing in mammalian cells.
Train_Line_8191 In each case, the methylation status was verified by nested PCR, molecular cloning and/or sequencing (data not shown).
Train_Line_8192 Germ-line mutations in DNA repair machinery genes, including BRCA1 and BRCA2, TP53 and ATM convey a strong inherited predisposition to neoplasia.
Train_Line_8193 Cases presenting with diagnostic criteria of classical ET or PMF associated with RS without overt dysplastic changes were excluded from the study.
Train_Line_8194 The median follow-up of patients was 3 years.
Train_Line_8195 Heritable GATA2 mutations associated with familial myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.
Train_Line_8196 It is also apparent that specific driver genes are responsible for the myeloproliferative component of the different MDS/MPN, like JAK2 or MPL in RARS-T, SETBP1 in aCML, and CSF3R in CNL.
Train_Line_8197 ZRSR2 mutations had no prognostic effect, possibly related to the low mutation rate.
Train_Line_8198 TET2 mutations have been identified in a range of myeloid malignancies and are one of the most frequently acquired genetic aberrations associated with MDS.
Train_Line_8199 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease.
Train_Line_8200 Figure 4. Correlation pattern between molecular mutations and karyotype. Data are given for associations between BCOR mutations and DNMT3A, NPM1, FLT3-ITD, CEBPA, MLL-PTD, RUNX1, and IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in 160 patients (top panel). The association between BCOR mutations and entity-defining cytogenetic abnormalities (40 patients) is shown in the bottom panel.
Train_Line_8201 With respect to recently published studies on novel candidate genes in MDS, data on SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF35 mutations appear somehow immature and/or inconsistent.
Train_Line_8202 Table 4. Somatic mutations that characterize the different types of MDS/MPN.
Train_Line_8203 To characterize the spectrum and frequency of SF3B1 mutations, the CMD-WG investigators undertook targeted resequencing of the gene in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
Train_Line_8204 5. Prognostic factors.
Train_Line_8205 This may partly reflect inaccuracies in the diagnosis of RARS related to difficulties in the identification of ring sideroblasts.
Train_Line_8206 The definition of CK-AML followed recommended criteria.
Train_Line_8207 Compared to most other JAK2 V617F-negative cases, the patient carrying a MPL W515L mutation expressed high levels of SOCS3 within mononuclear cells (Figure 3C).
Train_Line_8208 The transactivation domains TE-I and TE-II (regions 1 to 3 and 5 to 6) that interact with the transcriptional apparatus are only present in the p42 isoform, while the domains required for interaction with other transcription factors and the chromatin remodeling complex are present in both isoforms.
Train_Line_8209 One interpretation is that the abnormal mitochondrial iron homeostasis (Figure 3) results in excessive apoptosis of erythroid cells.
Train_Line_8210 In conclusion, this study demonstrated that WT1 mutations occurred with similar frequencies in patients with normal karyotype and those with abnormal cytogenetics.
Train_Line_8211 Possible new LNK mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Train_Line_8212 ASXL1 mutations can also cooperate with mutations in genes encoding signaling (CBL, JAK2, NF1, RAS) and splicing proteins (SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF35).
Train_Line_8213 RARS associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T) is a MDS/MPN characterized by refractory anemia associated with erythroid dysplasia and ringed sideroblasts, platelet count 450 x 109/L or greater, and the presence of large atypical megakaryocytes similar to those observed in BCR/ABL1-negative MPN.
Train_Line_8214 In the following sections, only
Train_Line_8215 The result showed that U2AF1 mutation was an independent poor prognostic factor for TTL in this group of patients (Supporting Information Table II).
Train_Line_8216 Next, we investigated all identified mutations of 10 BCOR mutated patients in bulky BM cells.
Train_Line_8217 More recently, germ-line mutations of GATA2 have been described in familial syndromes characterized by predisposition to MDS and AML.
Train_Line_8218 This is consistent with a causal relationship and makes SF3B1 the first gene to be strongly associated with a specific morphologic feature in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_8219 Final multivariate models informed the development of novel risk-classification rules.
Train_Line_8220 The potential utility of DNMT3A mutation status for determining prognosis in de novo MDS is compelling, but will need to be validated in larger clinical studies.
Train_Line_8221 These mutations have a strong phenotypic correlation with the presence of BM RS.
Train_Line_8222 Of 101 patients with an SF3B1 mutation, indeed, 91 had more than 15% ring sideroblasts, 7 patients had 1% to 14%, and only 3 patients did not show any ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow (Kendall Tau-b correlation coefficient = 0.54, P < .001).
Train_Line_8223 A similar degree of benefit is appreciated in terms of reduction in spleen size or relief from pruritus.
Train_Line_8224 Finally, ASXL1 mutations were more often seen in U2AF35-mut patients than in U2AF35-wt patients (45% vs 17%; P = .03).
Train_Line_8225 WT1 mutations may play a role in the disease progression in some patients.
Train_Line_8226 Patients harboring IDH mutations had a significantly higher incidence of ASXL1 mutation (47.6% vs. 22.0%, P = 0.007), DNMT3A mutation (36.4% vs. 8.7%, P<0.001) and SRSF2 mutation (45.5% vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001) than those with wild type IDH.
Train_Line_8227 Those who attained a complete remission after one or two courses of induction therapy were randomly assigned to one of three postinduction arms that differed with regard to dose-intensity of cytarabine.
Train_Line_8228 TP53-altered CK-AML patients were older (median 61 vs 54 years, P = .002) and had lower BM blast counts (median 65% vs 78%, P = .04; Table 1).
Train_Line_8229 Next-generation sequencing technologies represent a promising method for discovering novel genetic lesions in human neoplasms.
Train_Line_8230 Results.
Train_Line_8231 Very interestingly, 6 of the 8 subjects studied had somatic mutations in SF3B1.
Train_Line_8232 The former subgroup termed "AML with multilineage dysplasia" is now designated "AML with myelodysplasia-related changes."
Train_Line_8233 In MPNs, ASXL1 mutations are rare in ET and PV (< 7%) but frequent in PMF (from 19%-40%).
Train_Line_8234 Colonies were evaluated after 10- to 14-day culture.
Train_Line_8235 In three families, there was an identical heritable heterozygous variation in the transcription factor GATA2: c.1061C>T (p.Thr354Met) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Train_Line_8236 We investigated the relationship between JAK2V617F-positive and mutation negative subtypes with regard to morphologic, laboratory and clinical parameters and survival data.
Train_Line_8237 Finally, several studies are currently being conducted to define the prognostic relevance of SF3B1 mutations in CLL.
Train_Line_8238 These same three risk categories also had significant prognostic value in patients with AML who had mutant FLT3-ITD and a normal karyotype (Fig. S9B in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_8239 However, FLT3 analysis has also been performed retrospectively on stored MDS and CMML bone marrow specimens at MDACC dating back to 1997.
Train_Line_8240 Our results demonstrate U2AF35 mutations to be enriched in patients with ASXL1 mutations and confirm an earlier report that a deletion of chromosome 20 is often found in U2AF35-mut patients.
Train_Line_8241 Sequence analysis of bidirectional sequence traces was performed using Mutation Surveyor version 2.28 (SoftGenetics, State College, Pennsylvania, United States).
Train_Line_8242 In "APL with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA," RARA translocations with other partner genes are recognized separately.
Train_Line_8243 After the initial discovery of nonsense mutations in this gene by WES, our cohort for target deep sequencing was expanded and 28 mutations were discovered in various myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_8244 Peak-intensity-based label-free comparison was employed to compare relative protein abundance.
Train_Line_8245 In roughly 20% of the patients, 2 mutations are observed, suggesting that the inactivation of a single copy of TET2 is sufficient for the transformation process.
Train_Line_8246 We also screened a cohort of 65 healthy volunteers for mutations in exon 12 of ASXL1 but did not identify any mutation.
Train_Line_8247 The predicted severity of DNMT3A mutations with translational consequences was evaluated using the SIFT and Polyphen2 algorithms.
Train_Line_8248 High throughput DNA sequence analysis and the collection of a large number of MPD patient samples has enabled evaluation of a larger series of patients for mutations in candidate genes, including cytokine receptors.
Train_Line_8249 Treatment of the Setd2 knockdown pre-leukemic cells with the mTOR small-molecule inhibitor Torin1 or with rapamycin resulted in a marked decrease in cell growth (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 16).
Train_Line_8250 To define the prevalence of BCOR and BCORL1 mutations, we investigated a large cohort of 354 well-characterized MDS patients.
Train_Line_8251 Using data from a large cohort of patients treated in a single clinical trial, we found that more extensive mutational analysis can better discriminate patients with AML into various prognostic groups (Fig. 3).
Train_Line_8252 The PCR condition was: 95--degrees--C for 2 min; followed by 40 cycles of 95--degrees--C for 30 sec, 58--degrees--C for 30 sec, and 72--degrees--C for 30 sec; and finally, 72--degrees--C for 2 min.
Train_Line_8253 The BM report revealed 6% of blast infiltration and the patient was classified as a RAEB-1 disease.
Train_Line_8254 I manage, pregnant patients or women of child-bearing potential, in the same general manner and I do not use platelet-lowering agents or heparin therapy in the setting of low-risk disease.
Train_Line_8255 RESULTS.
Train_Line_8256 Since that time, recurrence studies in additional AML cohorts have reported that DNMT3A is one of the most frequently mutated genes in AML, occurring in up to 36% of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) patients in the largest series reported to date.
Train_Line_8257 The previously reported mutations were variable and differed across patients, except for one mutation (c.644C>T) that was detected in three cases (Table I).
Train_Line_8258 The 78 patients without ASXL1 mutation at both diagnosis and during sequential follow-ups are not shown in this table. MDS entity with bone marrow blasts 20-29% was subclassified as RAEBT according to FAB classification and that with bone marrow blasts more than 30% was subclassified as AML.
Train_Line_8259 The C-terminal KDEL motif is lost in all mutant variants (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Train_Line_8260 No Auer rods were detectable.
Train_Line_8261 All frameshift mutations were cloned by the TA cloning system (Promega, Madison, WI), with the PCR products spanning the original mutation spots according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI).
Train_Line_8262 Patients with wild-type DNMT3A and a related donor had a similar OS as compared with patients without a related donor (5-year OS, 50% v 57%, respectively, P = .24; Fig 3B).
Train_Line_8263 This data suggests that c.1934dupG;p.Gly646TrpfsX12 represents a true mutation.
Train_Line_8264 PolyPhen-2 predicts that p.Thr354Met and p.Thr355del are likely to affect GATA2 function.
Train_Line_8265 We also report a family with MDS with a 3-bp heritable deletion in GATA2 (resulting in p.Thr355del) which leads to the deletion of the second threonine in this sequence.
Train_Line_8266 SRSF2 mutation was closely associated with male sex (19.9% in males vs 2.8% in females, P = .001) and older age (median, 74.5 years for SRSF2-mutated patients vs 63.0 years for SRSF2-wild patients, P < .001).
Train_Line_8267 All mutations were confirmed in an independent experiment.
Train_Line_8268 Figure 1. Description of patients' samples. MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; AML, acute myeloid leukemia
Train_Line_8269 Imatinib has also been evaluated for treatment of SM which is typically characterised by activation loop mutations in KIT, particularly the D816V substitution.
Train_Line_8270 The finding of TP53 mutation in 33% of patients with poor risk IPSS cytogenetic risk mirrors earlier reports, (Padua et al 1998; Jasek et al 2010; Bejar et al 2011) and presence of mutation in 19% of patients with isolated 5q- syndrome, reconfirms our earlier observation (Jadersten et al 2011).
Train_Line_8271 In studies where the criterion CRi is used, relapse-free survival should be defined for all patients achieving CR or CRi; for event-free survival, relapse should be considered from CR and CRi.
Train_Line_8272 None of the sequentially analysed patients with TP53 mutation showed a total disappearance of the clone or emergence of new TP53 clones.
Train_Line_8273 Cytogenetics.
Train_Line_8274 The D residue corresponding to position 816 in KIT is highly conserved in RTKs indicating a key functional role and cell line studies have indicated that the loss of D was important, rather than the residue that replaced it.
Train_Line_8275 None of the 10 CEBPA-mutated AML patients studied were found to carry BCOR mutations.
Train_Line_8276 The imbalances most frequently found are losses affecting chromosome 5 or 5q (-5/5q-), -17/17p-, -7/7q-, -18/18q-, -16/16q-, -12/12p-, and gains affecting chromosome 8 or 8q (+8/+8q), +11/+11q, +21/+21q, +22/+22q, and +1/+1p.
Train_Line_8277 Several FLT3-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, midostaurin [PKC412], lestaurtinib [CEP-701], sunitinib [SU11248]) have in vitro cytotoxicity to leukemia cells.
Train_Line_8278 Approaches to addressing both of these issues as well as combination therapies to optimise use of KIT kinase inhibitors are discussed.
Train_Line_8279 Hazard ratios greater than 1 indicate an increased risk of an event for the first category listed.HR: hazard ratio; CI: confidence interval.
Train_Line_8280 It seems likely that the genetic change that has been identified here is responsible for the MF that develops in some patients.
Train_Line_8281 In summary, we identified ASXL1 mutations in 20.7% of patients with MDS (14.5% were frameshift mutations), and we found a strong association between ASXL1 frameshift mutations and adverse outcome in patients with MDS, for both OS and time to AML progression.
Train_Line_8282 Lineage-negative, Sca1-positive, c-kit-positive (LSK) cells were purified from C57BL/6 mice, as previously described.
Train_Line_8283 In another study of 33 young patients (<50 years of age) with ET treated with pipobroman only and followed for a median of almost 16 years, the complete remission rate was 94% and only one patient (3%) developed AML whereas no patient experienced thrombotic complications.
Train_Line_8284 Patients' characteristics in relation to IDH1/2 mutations.
Train_Line_8285 CALGB 8525 was a study comparing the duration of complete remission and overall survival in patients treated postremission with high, intermediate, or standard doses of cytarabine.
Train_Line_8286 All patients received intensive, response-adapted double induction and consolidation therapy.
Train_Line_8287 Clinical correlates of allele burden suggest a direct relationship of allele burden with splenomegaly and leukocytosis, though the relevance of JAK2 allele burden to outcome remains controversial.
Train_Line_8288 In the current study (N = 478), U2AF1 mutation was an independent poor-risk factor for OS.
Train_Line_8289 Mutational analysis allowed for the separation of patients with cytogenetically defined intermediate-risk AML into three subgroups with markedly different outcomes: a subgroup of patients with a favorable mutational risk profile (3-year rate of overall survival, 85%), a subgroup of patients with an unfavorable mutational risk profile (3-year rate of overall survival, 13%), and a subgroup of patients who remained at intermediate risk (3-year rate of overall survival, 42%).
Train_Line_8290 Notably, whereas wild-type GATA2 had different responses in HEK293 cells compared to Cos-7 cells on the RUNX1 enhancer (activating versus repressing, respectively), p.Thr354Met showed loss-of-function activity in both cell types (Supplementary Fig. 6).
Train_Line_8291 We found that with the exception of the two patients who received transplantation, the remaining 30 ASXL1-mutated patients analyzed retained the same mutation during serial follow-ups, including the one (patient 1) whose original mutation could be detected only by a sensitive gene-cloning technique, but not by direct sequencing, at the time of disease progression.
Train_Line_8292 Only mutations of SF3B1 showed a nonsignificant trend toward longer survival (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.54 to 1.07; P = .12).
Train_Line_8293 At least one mutation in any of the 16 analyzed genes was found in 154 of 221 patients (69.7%; Figure 2).
Train_Line_8294 If our findings are confirmed, testing for RAS mutations could become useful, in addition to CBF-AML detection, for risk-adapted stratification to HDAC postremission treatment in adults with de novo AML treated with chemotherapy alone.
Train_Line_8295 In vivo analyses demonstrated that the TET2-mutated cells from MPN samples are able to engraft into immunodeficient mice.
Train_Line_8296 Since ASXL1 mutations occurring in MDS were first described, mutations in ASXL1 have also been identified in other myeloid malignancies, like AML, chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
Train_Line_8297 Point mutations were confirmed in independent experiments.
Train_Line_8298 Figure 1. Flow chart outlining the different phases of the study. Two phases of the study were performed. In phase 1, the identification of candidate somatic mutations by WES was carried out in an index patient. BCOR mutations were subsequently searched for in 82 CN-AML patients with the same genotype as the AM Lindex patient. In phase 2 of the study, additional patient cohorts and associations between BCOR and other molecular mutations were investigated.
Train_Line_8299 In addition, we found that only three patients were homozygous for CALR mutations associated with uniparental disomy of chromosome 19p, and all three had a 5-bp insertion of type 2 (Fig. 3A).
Train_Line_8300 DNA from bone marrow or peripheral blood was extracted using conventional methods.
Train_Line_8301 Hierarchical clustering was performed with the use of the Lance-Williams dissimilarity formula and the complete-linkage algorithm.
Train_Line_8302 Among the remaining two patients without documented progression to AML, one patient had a leukocyte count of 70.2 x 109 /L with 1% blasts in the differential count at the time of death.
Train_Line_8303 The cohort of patients with frameshift mutations had lower ASXL1 expression levels compared with patients who had wild-type ASXL1 (P = .086; Table 1).
Train_Line_8304 Given that Asx in Drosophila appears to regulate Polycomb - as well as Trithorax-group gene function, we analyzed the effect of ASXL1 mutations and loss on the chromatin modifications placed by these enzymatic complexes.
Train_Line_8305 This study aimed to determine the incidence/prognostic impact of TP53 mutation in 318 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, and to correlate the changes to cytogenetics, single nucleotide polymorphism array karyotyping and clinical outcome.
Train_Line_8306 Accordingly, we found that the type 1 deletions were significantly more frequent in primary myelofibrosis than in essential thrombocythemia (P<0.001).
Train_Line_8307 Myelodysplasia driver genes may also interact with somatic mutations involving lymphoid cell lines, thus giving rise to peculiar phenotypes.
Train_Line_8308 Tumor xenograft studies were performed in accordance with recommendations in Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the NIH and were conducted under a protocol approved by Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Train_Line_8309 Mutations in the de novo DNA methylation protein, DNMT3A, demethylation machinery, TET2 and related IDH1/2 production of onco-metabolite 2-hydroxygluterate, and polycomb complex proteins EZH2 and ASXL1 have opened new pathophysiologic clues into these diseases.
Train_Line_8310 However, it is to be noted that the recommended platelet target is not based on controlled evidence.
Train_Line_8311 ASXL1 mutations are found in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Train_Line_8312 Similarly, EZH2 mutations were found to be significantly associated with a shorter overall in lower risk MDS, and their incorporation in a prognostic model improved risk stratification in these patients.
Train_Line_8313 Using whole-exome sequencing, we analyzed genomic DNA from granulocytes (tumor samples) and CD3+ T cells (control samples) obtained from six patients with primary myelo ibrosis.
Train_Line_8314 Similarly, CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells transduced with shRNA against DDX41 showed significantly enhanced colony formation (Figure 4C).
Train_Line_8315 Presently, the role of SOCS proteins in the pathogenesis of MPN remains unclear: Is the epigenetic silencing a cooperating event with JAK2V617F27 or is it at the origin of some MPNs such as ET?

Train_Line_8317 A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Train_Line_8318 8. Management of older patients: 60 years or older.
Train_Line_8319 To investigate whether the interleukin-3 independence in the CALR type 1-mutated cells was caused by the activation of JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling, we determined the sensitivity of cells to the JAK2 kinase inhibitor SAR302503.
Train_Line_8320 The SH2B3 mutations E208Q (EQ), A215V (AV) and G220V (GV) in the pcDNA3.1/V5 human SH2B3 vector and E182Q (EQ) and G194V (GV) in the MIG murine Sh2b3 vectors were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based, site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Train_Line_8321 The mutations appeared to be present in a major leukemic clone based on the visual inspection of chromatograms (patients analyzed by Sanger sequencing), or based on the proportion of mutated reads (patients analyzed by 454 amplicon sequencing), relative to the percentage of leukemic cells in the analyzed samples and to the sex of the patient.
Train_Line_8322 The locations of the remaining missense mutations fall within the methyltransferase domain (Figure 1).
Train_Line_8323 Figure 1. MPLW515L Mutation Is Found in JAK2V617F-Negative MF and Causes Cytokine-Independent Growth in 32D and UT7 Cells, and Constitutively Activates the JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway. (A) Forward (middle trace) and reverse (lower trace) sequence traces demonstrating a heterozygous guanine to thymine substitution (arrows) present in granulocyte DNA from a patient with MF. The mutation is not present in buccal DNA from the same patient (upper trace). (B) DNA sequence and protein translation for both the wild-type and mutant MPL alleles. The mutation results in a tryptophan-to-leucine substitution at codon 515. (C) Upper: 32D cells transduced with MPLW515L exhibit cytokine-independent growth compared with MPLWT (left).

Train_Line_8324 Mononuclear cells from patients' samples were enriched by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and were stored at -196--degrees--C in liquid nitrogen until use.
Train_Line_8325 FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE TYPE 1 CALR MUTATION.
Train_Line_8326 The differentiation-inducing transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) is required for proper control of adipogenesis, glucose metabolism, granulocytic differentiation, and lung development.
Train_Line_8327 Interestingly, the same IDH1 mutation at position 132 was found when sequencing the genome of a patient with AML-M1.
Train_Line_8328 To extend these studies, we screened CD34+ cells, CD3+ T cells, and skin tissue for TET2 mutations that were present in the bone marrow of affected patients.
Train_Line_8329 Statistical Methods.
Train_Line_8330 Indeed, overexpression of C/EBPalpha in hepatocytes leads to impaired proliferation and tumorigenicity in human hepatoma cell lines.
Train_Line_8331 Appendix: Definitions for basic terms used in studies of the genetic basis of myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_8332 The Wilms' Tumor 1 (WT1) gene, encoding a zinc-finger transcription factor, is physiologically expressed in embryonic kidney cells and hematopoietic stem cells.
Train_Line_8333 Of note is that a somatic splice-site DDX41 mutation was previously listed along with other somatic mutations found in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Ding et al, 2012; The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2013); TCGA cohort also contained the recurrent p.R525H mutation.
Train_Line_8334 Patient DNA was amplified using the following polymerase chain reaction conditions: 95--degrees--C for 10 minutes, 35 cycles of 95--degrees--C for 1 minute, 56--degrees--C for 1 minute, and 72--degrees--C for 70 seconds followed by one cycle of 72--degrees--C for 5 minutes.
Train_Line_8335 Univariate analysis performed on the subgroup of patients with normal cytogenetics demonstrated that the presence of a TET2 mutation was associated with a significantly worse OS (32 vs 90 months; P = .03).
Train_Line_8336 Of note, approximately 40% of patients with NPM1 mutations also carry FLT3-ITD, and multiple studies have shown that the genotype "mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD" represents a favorable prognostic marker, with higher CR rates, and better RFS and OS that is reminiscent of that seen in patients with inv(16) or t(8;21).
Train_Line_8337 However, the growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing nonmutant and mutant calreticulin was suppressed equally on treatment with a JAK2 kinase inhibitor, suggesting that the JAK-STAT pathway is required for cytokine-independent proliferation induced by mutant calreticulin.
Train_Line_8338 C/EBPalpha regulates the expression of many myeloid genes, including genes encoding growth factor receptors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) and the so-called secondary granule proteins (ie, lactoferrin).
Train_Line_8339 DNMT3A mutations have been associated with a negative impact on overall survival (OS), but a more detailed analysis of the prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations in terms of impact on remission rate and relapse-free survival (RFS) in a uniformly treated, well-characterized AML patient cohort is still missing.
Train_Line_8340 Concluding Remarks.
Train_Line_8341 We did not detect either MPL-W515L or MPL-W515K mutations in any other patient with RARS-T.
Train_Line_8342 Although our analyses of clinical outcome are retrospective, they strongly suggest that CALR-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms have a more benign clinical course than the corresponding disorders associated with JAK2 or MPL mutations.
Train_Line_8343 These inhibitors have activity as a single agent in relapsed AML with FLT3 mutations, although usually only a transient reduction of blasts in blood, and, to a lesser extent, in marrow, has been observed.
Train_Line_8344 In this comprehensive analysis of 489 patients with AML, we identified mutations in DNMT3A in 17.8% of all investigated patients with AML and a frequency of 27.2% in patients with CN-AML.
Train_Line_8345 Patients were studied at diagnosis or during follow-up before any disease-modifying treatment (ie, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, aggressive chemotherapy, or hypomethylating agents).
Train_Line_8346 Interestingly, in all 5 BCOR-mutated AML patients, BCOR mRNA levels were substantially reduced to a mean of 22% of the levels detected in the 14 control AML patients (range, 6.9%-39.3%; Figure 3A; P = .006 by Wilcoxon 2-sample test of delta-Ct values).
Train_Line_8347 CONSEQUENCES OF DNMT3A MUTATIONS.
Train_Line_8348 The procedures followed were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000, and samples were obtained after subjects provided informed consent.
Train_Line_8349 Alternatively, an SF3B1 mutation may mitigate the negative impact of other concomitant molecular lesions.
Train_Line_8350 Association of SRSF2 mutation with other mutations.
Train_Line_8351 Conflict of interest: Nothing to report We conducted a retrospective review of patients with MDS and CMML evaluated at MDACC between January 1997 and December 2010.
Train_Line_8352 Because the prognostic influence of mutations in ASXL1 mutations in MDS is unknown, we examined the DNA of 193 patients with MDS for the presence of mutations in ASXL1 by direct sequencing, and we evaluated their prognostic impact.
Train_Line_8353 Retrospective studies show outcome is limited by a high relapse rate and a high nonrelapse mortality leading to OS rates of 20% to 30%.
Train_Line_8354 Second, the mutations occur in a specific C-terminal region of CALR and always generate a frameshift mutation.
Train_Line_8355 These results suggest that BRCC3 might be a tumor-associated gene in myeloid neoplasms.
Train_Line_8356 The blast cell count, as evaluated on bone marrow smears and on CD34 stained bone marrow sections, was initially <5% in all specimens.
Train_Line_8357 The different spliceosome mutations are associated with different phenotypes and different clinical outcomes (Table 3).
Train_Line_8358 Because of the poor prognosis of patients in relapse, it would be useful to be able to assess whether treatment with curative intent is a realistic possibility for a particular patient.
Train_Line_8359 RESULTS.
Train_Line_8360 Imatinib has also been tested without success in AML.
Train_Line_8361 The germline DDX41 lesions strongly predispose to further somatic hits in the remaining healthy allele of this gene, suggesting that a higher level of haploinsufficiency created by a somatic missense mutation further enhances the clonal advantage.
Train_Line_8362 Deep sequencing was performed using the 454 GS FLX Titanium amplicon chemistry (Roche Applied Science).
Train_Line_8363 There is clear evidence that TET2 mutations, and also ASXL1 and EZH2 mutations, may precede JAK2V617 but that the converse may also occur.
Train_Line_8364 This year marks forty years since Dr. Janet Rowley published her seminal letter identifying the recurrent genetic translocation responsible for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Train_Line_8365 In PV, a higher JAK2V617F mutant allele burden has been associated with pruritus and fibrotic transformation.
