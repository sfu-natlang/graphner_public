Test_Line_8366 Most mutated patients had a normal karyotype, suggesting that cohesin gene mutations do not act through destabilization of chromosomal integrity in AML, but rather alternative mechanisms such as transcriptional control.

Test_Line_8368 The first author and an author who was an employee of the sponsor wrote the initial draft of the manuscript, with assistance from a medical writer who was paid by the sponsor.
Test_Line_8369 Among these mutations, it seems that AML patients under the age of 60 with DNMT3A mutations have improved overall survival when treated with high-dose anthracycline chemotherapy, whereas the other genetic subsets of patients mentioned here do not seem to benefit, on average, from dose-intensified induction therapy.
Test_Line_8370 Safety.
Test_Line_8371 The high frequency with which cohesin mutations occur in myeloid disease and their presence in expanding subclones during disease progression suggests that the cohesin complex may represent an attractive therapeutic target for future preclinical and clinical studies.
Test_Line_8372 Interestingly, the IDH2-R172 mutation seemed to be mutually exclusive with NPM1 mutations and FLT3-ITD.
Test_Line_8373 The mean hemoglobin level in patients who received ruxolitinib reached a nadir of 95 g per liter after approximately 8 to 12 weeks of therapy (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix), with an increase by week 24 to a new steady state (101 g per liter).
Test_Line_8374 The most frequent causes of death were intracranial hemorrhage, progressive disease/blastic transformation, and regimen-related toxicity from induction chemotherapy or transplantation.
Test_Line_8375 Collaboration of other genetic or epigenetic alterations in the great majority of patients with CMML and RUNX1 mutations, especially at AML transformation, requires further investigation.
Test_Line_8376 Although these mutations were common and found in a wide spectrum of myeloid diseases, some are strongly associated with specific phenotypic features, such as SF3B1 mutations with MDS or MDS/MPN with RS and SRSF2 mutations with CMML and advanced forms of MDS such as sAML and RA with excess blasts.
Test_Line_8377 Further mutational screening in other malignancies might uncover the pathogenesis of common or unique tumorgenesis in various tissues.
Test_Line_8378 A total of 23.2% of patients who received ruxolitinib and 14.6% of patients who received placebo had bruising; all events were grade 1 or 2 except for one grade 3 event in the ruxolitinib group.
Test_Line_8379 On the other hand, low levels ( 1%) of the mutant JAK2 have been reported in ET patients (as determined using allele-specific loop-mediated amplification assay).
Test_Line_8380 Patients without JAK2 (V617F) were evaluated for MPL exon 10 mutations using a high-resolution melt assay or Sanger sequencing.
Test_Line_8381 There was an improvement of 50% or more in the total symptom score at 24 weeks in 45.9% of patients who received ruxolitinib as compared with 5.3% of patients who received placebo (P<0.001).
Test_Line_8382 Overall, the response rates for INF-alpha are promising but remain comparable with those already achieved by hydroxyurea.
Test_Line_8383 Five hundred nanograms of this PCR product were hybridized to the SureSelect Human All Exon Kits Version 2 (Agilent Technologies), covering 44 Mb of the human exome during 24 hours.
Test_Line_8384 More recently, somatic, heterozygous activating mutations of EZH2 that affect Y641 have been identified in germinal-centre diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas.
Test_Line_8385 Patients had disease that was refractory to available therapies, had side effects requiring their discontinuation, or were not candidates for available therapies and had disease requiring treatment.
Test_Line_8386 Base calling was performed using Illumina RTA Version 1.8 using default settings.
Test_Line_8387 Granulocyte isolation is not necessary because granulocytes comprise approximately 45% to 75% of total white blood cells in normal individuals, and this proportion is even higher in peripheral blood of MPN patients.
Test_Line_8388 Prognostically significant somatic mutations occurred in patients in all risk groups.
Test_Line_8389 This advance clearly illustrates the clinical relevance of defining the molecular basis of hematologic malignancies.
Test_Line_8390 BCORL1 somatic mutations were found in about 6% of a series of 173 AML patients which included cases with secondary leukemia (showing myelodysplasia-related changes or being therapy-related) and a high incidence (approx. 65%) of abnormal karyotypes.
Test_Line_8391 Further investigation is needed to determine which role the cohesin-complex fulfills in AML and whether cohesin mutations have clinical implications.
Test_Line_8392 Our survey of more than 900 mutations in 111 cancer-associated genes identified only 6 mutated oncogenes, which were present in less than 10% of samples.
Test_Line_8393 In our cohort, STAG1 followed by STAG2 and SMC3 mutations were the most frequently mutated genes in the cohesin complex, whereas SMC1A mutations were rare events.
Test_Line_8394 This Review focuses on somatic genetic alterations that result in malignant myeloid transformation by affecting DNA cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation as well as histone methylation, acetylation, ubiquityation and phosphorylation.
Test_Line_8395 The predictive model was subsequently validated in an independent cohort of elderly patients (N = 801) treated with 2 courses of induction therapy with cytarabine and daunorubicin.
Test_Line_8396 Overall survival was evaluated for all patients by means of unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling; models were adjusted for the IPSS risk group assigned at the time of sample collection.
Test_Line_8397 Although detection of JAK2 V617F and MPL mutations in the appropriate clinical settings confirms the diagnosis of ET or PMF, absence of the mutations does not rule out disease.
Test_Line_8398 These are then cleaved by an endonuclease, and the resulting single-strand break can then be processed by either short-patch BER (through which a single nucleotide is replaced) or long-patch BER (through which 2-10 new nucleotides are synthesized).
Test_Line_8399 The median DFS in patients who achieved a CR with low-dose cytarabine was 8 months.
Test_Line_8400 The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to estimate the distribution of OS and RFS, and to compare differences between survival curves, respectively.
Test_Line_8401 In contrast, TP53 mutations were observed mainly in patients with intermediate-2 or high risk according to the IPSS (79%) and were strongly associated with thrombocytopenia, an elevated blast proportion, and a complex karyotype.
Test_Line_8402 HR >1 or <1 indicate an increased or decreased risk, respectively, of an event for the first category listed.
Test_Line_8403 In humans, however, recent evidence indicates that acquisition of JAK2V617F may not be the primary oncogenic event and the relative predisposition to JAK2V617F mutation may be more contributory to disease phenotype.
Test_Line_8404 Although activation of tyrosine kinase pathways is a shared theme among myeloproliferative neoplasms, the pathogenetic basis of chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) has remained elusive.
Test_Line_8405 Of greatest diagnostic effect are recurrent mutations found in specific genes.
Test_Line_8406 If no mass effect is seen, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology should be sampled by LP.
Test_Line_8407 In addition, the expression of IDH1 or IDH2 mutants in mouse bone-marrow-derived cells induced the expression of markers associated with immature (less differentiated) cells, a phenotype that is similar to Tet2-knockdown or Tet2-knockout cells.
Test_Line_8408 Interestingly, some laboratories obtained positive results with all four specimens, whereas others obtained negative results with all four.
Test_Line_8409 With respect to ASXL1 mutations, Sanger sequencing indicated a burden of ~50%.
Test_Line_8410 The application of high-throughput molecular technologies, including high-density single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-As) and new sequencing technologies has led to the improved characterization of genomic lesions such as chromosomal aberrations and of somatic mutations affecting specific classes of genes, including signal transducers (eg, CBL), apoptotic genes (eg, TP53 and RAS), genes involved in epigenetic regulation of DNA (eg, DNMT3A, IDH1/2, and TET2), and histone modifiers (eg, EZH2, UTX, and ASXL1).
Test_Line_8411 Protein tyrosine phosphatases have been thought to play a role in tumor suppression due to antagonize the activity of the protein tyrosine kinase.
Test_Line_8412 In summary, our results show that mutations in the cohesin complex are recurrent mutations in AML.
Test_Line_8413 Mutations in enzymatic modifiers represent attractive targets for directed therapy in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_8414 Table 1. Clinical characteristics of patients with cohesin family gene defects.
Test_Line_8415 Mutations in a subset of epigenetic regulators, including TET2, ASXL1 and DNMT3A, are associated with poor overall survival; as such, these mutant alleles define a subset of high-risk leukaemia that is in need of novel, mechanism-based therapies.
Test_Line_8416 Of note, for the most frequently mutated genes, that is, EZH2, ASXL1, TET2, RAS and CBL various pairwise analyses were performed between wild-type/wild-type, mutated/wild-type, wild-type/mutated and mutated/mutated combinations.
Test_Line_8417 Finally, a U2 snRNP complex replaces SF1 bound to the branchpoint sequence with one of its subcomponent, SF3B1, to establish a splicing A complex (Fig. 1).
Test_Line_8418 A between-group comparison of adverse events reported after interruption or permanent discontinuation of the study drug showed no clear pattern of a specific withdrawal effect.
Test_Line_8419 A repeat bone marrow evaluation is performed in these patients and in those with hypoplasia after induction to document remission status.
Test_Line_8420 However, a number of critical issues remain unsolved: what is the molecular mechanism for these mutations to contribute to MDS pathogenesis, to what extent the deregulated RNA splicing could be involved in that process, what is the molecular nature of the predicted gain-of-functions, and what are the targets of these genes.
Test_Line_8421 For qualitative JAK2 V617F testing, the report should clearly indicate a final analytic result (eg, JAK2 V617F mutation DETECTED or JAK2 V617F mutation NOT DETECTED).
Test_Line_8422 The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate survival.
Test_Line_8423 The estimated 2-year EFS and OS rates were 23.5% and 38%, respectively, and estimated 4-year EFS and OS rates were 18% and 26.5%, respectively; no differences were observed between treatment arms with regard to EFS, OS, and cumulative relapse rates.
Test_Line_8424 Despite recent major advances in our understanding of the genetics of myeloid malignancies, there have been far fewer examples of how these insights have translated to novel therapies.
Test_Line_8425 For example, in a specimen with 40% mutant alleles, it is unclear whether the sample is actually composed of 40% cells with a monoallelic mutation or 20% cells with a biallelic mutation.
Test_Line_8426 However, in low-risk MDS, patients with SF3B1 mutations showed a tendency toward better prognosis (P = .09), whereas those with SRSF2 mutations had worse survival.
Test_Line_8427 Consistent with the coordinated changes in gene expression that occur during haematopoietic differentiation, researchers have observed regular patterns of DNA methylation on differentiation into specific haematopoietic lineages.
Test_Line_8428 When stratifying by normal/abnormal karyotype, no particular genetic lesion was enriched based on karyotype, although 5 out of 9 patients (55%) with RUNX1 mutations and abnormal karyotype had trisomy 8.
Test_Line_8429 This is particularly true of elderly patients with AML.
Test_Line_8430 The samples were then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2000 that generated paired end reads of 100 nucleotides.
Test_Line_8431 The immunologic standard evaluation, even though it was not systemically performed, revealed mild abnormalities (supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_8432 Table 2. Hazard Ratios for Death in a Multivariable Model.
Test_Line_8433 Positive controls for MPL mutations are more difficult to obtain.
Test_Line_8434 The emerging realization of the molecular diversity of MDS parallels the clinical and phenotypic heterogeneity of this disease.
Test_Line_8435 However, for patients at high risk for CNS disease, such as those with monocytic differentiation (M4 or M5 morphology) or high WBC count (> 100,000/mcL) at presentation, a diagnostic LP should be considered as part of the documentation of remission status.
Test_Line_8436 Consistent with the mouse data, TET2 mutations are seen in up to 50% of cases of CMML.
Test_Line_8437 Molecular profiling of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia reveals diverse mutations in >80% of patients with TET2 and EZH2 being of high prognostic relevance.
Test_Line_8438 Table 1. 2008 World Health Organization Diagnostic Criteria for Polycythemia Vera.
Test_Line_8439 On the basis of these findings, we screened other rationally selected genes within the spliceosomal machinery in patients with MDS and related disorders (n = 120).
Test_Line_8440 Cooperating mutations of FLT3 and RAS genes were also analyzed in CMML patients harboring RUNX1 mutations (Table 1); one patient had FLT3-TKD (Asp835Tyr), three patients had NRAS mutations and one had a KRAS mutation.
Test_Line_8441 We screened all 9 coding exons for coding sequence changes that would result in a defect of the protein (small deletion, insertion, or point mutation) by PCR-SSCP and direct sequencing.
Test_Line_8442 Spleen Size.
Test_Line_8443 No buccal sample was available for the sole patient with a mutation in FLNB (R566Q), so this mutation could not be assumed to be somatic.
Test_Line_8444 Laboratory Practice Guidelines for Detecting and Reporting JAK2 and MPL Mutations in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms: A Report of the Association for Molecular Pathology.
Test_Line_8445 PTEN/MMAC1 is a putative tumor suppressor gene recently identified at chromosome 10q23.3, which contains 9 exons and encodes a 403 amino acid protein.
Test_Line_8446 Of 7 patients with STAG1 mutations, 3 patients also showed an NPM1 mutation.
Test_Line_8447 Traditional allele-specific PCR and allele-specific qPCR assays have also been used, but these assays are limited to assessing specific mutations.
Test_Line_8448 These benefits came at the cost of more frequent anemia and thrombocytopenia in the early part of the treatment period.
Test_Line_8449 In this analysis, median OS between the Intermediate I and Intermediate II groups were not as widely separated among patients aged 60 years and younger (13.6 vs. 18.7 months, respectively); in patients older than 60 years, median OS was similar between the 2 intermediate groups (9.5 vs. 9.2 months, respectively).
Test_Line_8450 C-terminal mutations have recently been described in a large series of MDS/AML in which no patient with CMML was included.
Test_Line_8451 The most-effective alternative treatments to hydroxyurea in PV and ET are INF-alpha and busulfan.
Test_Line_8452 It is currently unknown whether 5-fC and 5-caC serve any function other than as oxidative by-products of 5-hmC and intermediates in DNA demethylation.
Test_Line_8453 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_8454 Regulators of DNA methylation (such as TET2, IDH1, IDH2 and DNMT3A) and of histone modifications (such as MLL translocations, ASXL1 and EZH2) are targeted by somatic alterations in a significant subset of patients with myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_8455 Principles of AML Treatment.
Test_Line_8456 Affymetrix U133plus2 CEL files for 183 MDS patients and 17 healthy controls in Gene Expression Omnibus GSE19429 were pooled using Bioconductor's gcrma tools for quantile normalization.
Test_Line_8457 Disease-free survival was 51% for related HLA-matched donors and 67% for unrelated donors.
Test_Line_8458 Aspirin for thromboprophylaxis in PV was previously limited because of a documented risk of gastrointestinal bleeding with high doses (900 mg/day).
Test_Line_8459 Presumably, these results reflect differences in analytical sensitivity among the participating laboratories.
Test_Line_8460 RUNX1 mutations have rarely been reported in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML).
Test_Line_8461 We then analyzed the effect of these mutations in more clinically uniform subgroups to more precisely determine their clinical consequences.
Test_Line_8462 Clinical and biologic annotations of the samples have been declared to the Comite National Informatique et Libertes.
Test_Line_8463 All of these patterns were found in our AML patients. Sequencing of the normal-sized RT-PCR products amplified from the AML specimens, cell lines, and normal controls showed wild-type PTEN/MMAC1 transcripts except in the U937 line (4-base insertion) (data not shown).
Test_Line_8464 Radiation of all blood products is advised in all patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, particularly for patients receiving fludarabine-based regimens and those undergoing HSCT.
Test_Line_8465 Statistical analyses were carried out using an SPSS software version 8.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Test_Line_8466 Cumulative risk of thrombosis according to JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status.
Test_Line_8467 Patients with PMF are considered low risk if they have no risk factors, intermediate-1 risk if they have 1 risk factor, intermediate-2 if they have 2 risk factors, and high risk if they have 3 or more risk factors.
Test_Line_8468 The differential counts were within the normal range without evident myeloid cytologic abnormalities.
Test_Line_8469 Notably, the majority of somatic DNMT3A mutations result either in premature truncation of the protein product (nonsense or frameshift mutations), or occur at a single amino acid, R882.
Test_Line_8470 Table 2. MPL Mutations in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.
Test_Line_8471 In a European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) trial, patients with high-risk myelodysplasia or AML evolving from myelodysplasia who received allogeneic HSCT without prior cytarabinebased chemotherapy had a 3-year DFS rate of 34%.
Test_Line_8472 The increasing use of next-generation sequencing technologies applied to the study of cancer genomes is making a remarkable contribution to our knowledge of the molecular landscape of CN-AML.
Test_Line_8473 Some presentations by other groups at the 2011 meeting of the American Society of Hematology suggested a correlation between SF3B1 and DNMT3A mutations and a favorable survival effect of RUNX1 mutations in CMML with SRSF2.
Test_Line_8474 Analysis of cohesin mutations.
Test_Line_8475 Patient pedigree 1 samples were obtained after written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were stored at the HIMIP (Hematologie-Inserm Midi-Pyrenees) collection (declared to the Ministry of Higher Education and Research as DC 2008-307 collection 1).
Test_Line_8476 It is the most common form of acute leukemia among adults and accounts for the largest number of annual deaths from leukemias in the United States.
Test_Line_8477 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_8478 Total white blood cells from the peripheral blood are the preferred type of cell population for these analyses.
Test_Line_8479 This results in decreased global arginine methylation of the PRMT5 targets histone H2A and histone H4 and in altered haematopoietic progenitor cell expansion and erythroid differentiation.
Test_Line_8480 Figure 2. Kaplan-Meier estimates of (a) overall survival for CMML patients with and without RUNX1 mutations (P = 0.928), and (b) acute myeloid leukemia transformation for CMML patients with and without RUNX1 mutations (P = 0.175), C-terminal mutations vs those without mutation (P = 0.022). CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Test_Line_8481 However, further studies are needed to analyze the stability of these markers, as we also found 1 patient in which the SMC1A mutation from the time of diagnosis was neither present during remission nor at the time of relapse.
Test_Line_8482 Notably, expression of the entire cohesin complex was reduced in patients with STAG2 mutations in a manner similar to that seen in patients with reduced cohesin expression in the absence of mutations (Figure 6B).
Test_Line_8483 In the past 5 years, the presence of autosomal chromosome monosomies in AML has emerged as an important prognostic factor associated with extremely poor prognosis.
Test_Line_8484 Patients were also randomized to receive all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or no ATRA.
Test_Line_8485 Interestingly, mutations in this complex were mutually exclusive, similar to other mutations that belonged to 1 pathway similar to genes of the spliceosome complex or mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TET2.
Test_Line_8486 It is responsible for removing small, non-helix-distorting base lesions from the genome.
Test_Line_8487 We are not proposing it as clinical tool for several reasons, including the fact that to this purpose it should be validated in an independent patient cohort.
Test_Line_8488 The molecular consequences of the mutations identified here can be classified in 2 distinct groups, the first with mutations located in or close to the second GATA2 zinc finger (A372T mutation in P2 located between the third [C370] and fourth [C373] cysteines of the zinc finger, M388V in P3 and R396Q in P1) and the second with the complete loss of 1 allele of GATA2 (P7) or creation of a stop codon leading to the loss of the second zinc finger (R330X mutation in P4 located in the first zinc finger, R204X [P5] and E224X [P6] mutations leading to the loss of the 2 zinc fingers).
Test_Line_8489 Statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software package SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
Test_Line_8490 These combinatorial mutations suggest a requirement for different therapeutic approaches tailored to the molecular profile of individual patients.
Test_Line_8491 As previously mentioned, FLT3-TKD in the presence of FLT3-ITD or occurring with t(15;17)/PML-RARA seems to be associated with poorer prognosis.
Test_Line_8492 Therefore, these molecular markers have not been incorporated into the risk categorization schema in the current guidelines.
Test_Line_8493 The diversity of PMF subtypes was not fully appreciated as long as the only known mutant genes associated with this condition were JAK2 and MPL, as illustrated in Figure 7.
Test_Line_8494 Results were analyzed with CNAG (Version 3.0) or Genotyping Console (Affymetrix).
Test_Line_8495 We identified and validated mutations in 10 genes: NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, JAK2, GNAS, FLNB, MET, EGFR, CDH1, and PTPN11.
Test_Line_8496 Only the mutation R396Q in P1 has been described previously in 1 case of MonoMAC syndrome.
Test_Line_8497 The CR (including CRp) rate was significantly higher with decitabine (18% vs. 8%; P = .001).
Test_Line_8498 To detect germline variants of cohesin genes, our strategy was to select nonsynonymous variants present in both somatic and germline samples that are possibly deleterious.
Test_Line_8499 Abnormal RNA splicing caused by splicing factor mutations.
Test_Line_8500 For the remaining patients with mutations, the somatic origin could not be confirmed due to lack of suitable material.
Test_Line_8501 The significance of these differences remains to be elucidated. Whether the aberrant transcripts in these candidate tumor suppressor genes are important in leukemogenesis or are merely the consequence of splicing infidelity in leukemic cells needs further investigation.
Test_Line_8502 The precise pathogenetic mechanisms associated with facilitation of clonal evolution remain unclear.
Test_Line_8503 These findings show that ruxolitinib is an effective therapy for myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_8504 The SWOG/ECOG trial reported a 5-year survival rate (from time of CR) of 44% with allogeneic HSCT (n = 18; 61% underwent HSCT) and 13% with autologous HSCT (n = 20; 50% underwent HSCT) among the subgroup of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics; moreover, the 5-year survival rate was similar between those allocated to autologous HSCT and those intended for chemotherapy consolidation alone (13% and 15%, respectively).
Test_Line_8505 The GATA2 R396Q variation was not identified in the maternal grandparents' DNA, but the NEK11 D87Y variation was detected in the maternal grandfather's DNA sample.
Test_Line_8506 The proportion of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics tends to be higher in the population with therapy-related AML.
Test_Line_8507 Although there are small-molecule inhibitors for JAK2, such as ruxolitinib [approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for myelofibrosis], these target the JAK2 and often the JAK1 proteins, and thus are not specific for the V617F mutation.
Test_Line_8508 These mutations alter pre-mRNA splicing patterns.
Test_Line_8509 No difference in clinical outcome was seen for ASXL1-mutated patients versus ASXL1 wild-type or taking different numbers of mutations into account.
Test_Line_8510 The activated JAK2 causes phosphorylation of STATs, which then dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they regulate gene transcription.
Test_Line_8511 The probability of 5-year disease-free survival was 33%, 22%, and 27%, respectively.
Test_Line_8512 The second study was a phase II clinical trial that reported complete hematologic remission in 94.6% of patients who received pegylated INF-alpha (90-135 mu/week) after 31.4 months of median follow-up and 21.4% of patients in complete molecular remission.
Test_Line_8513 By contrast, ASXL1 loss did not result in significant changes in H2AK119 ubiquitylation in myeloid haematopoietic cells.
Test_Line_8514 IDH1 mutations have now also been identified in chondrosarcomas, cholangiocarcinomas, colorectal cancer and thyroid cancer, and Mardis et al identified recurrent IDH1 mutations in AML.
Test_Line_8515 Genomic DNA was extracted from BM or peripheral blood with the use of standard methods and subjected agarose gel and optical density ratio tests to confirm the purity and concentration before Covaris fragmentation.
Test_Line_8516 One patient had a baseline spleen length recorded as nonpalpable in error but had a prior measurement of 16 cm and a baseline spleen volume of 2450 cm3.
Test_Line_8517 The high-risk molecular group is defined as either NPM1-wild-type/FLT3-ITD-negative, or NPM1-wild-type/FLT3-ITD-positive, or NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD-positive. The low-risk molecular group is defined by the presence of an NPM1 mutation and the absence of FLT3-ITD.
Test_Line_8518 The lower mutation frequency in our study may be explained by our approach that we only considered mutations that could be validated by Sanger sequencing and therefore are present in at least 10% to 20% of all cells.
Test_Line_8519 Median time to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation was 21 months (range, 3-94 months).
Test_Line_8520 Treatment-related mortality rates were 6% and 17%, respectively.
Test_Line_8521 The algorithm can be accessed online at http://www.aml-score.org/.
Test_Line_8522 Mutations have been identified in R172 and R140 of the IDH2 gene, with R140 mutation occurring more frequently.
Test_Line_8523 The cumulative incidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, marked leukocytosis, thrombotic events, and leukemic transformation was estimated with a competing risk approach, considering death for any cause as a competing event.
Test_Line_8524 When serial samples were analyzed, we found that an U2AF1 mutation detected at the sAML stage was present from initial MDS presentations, suggesting an ancestral origin of this mutation (supplemental Figure 5).
Test_Line_8525 In 1999, the WHO developed a newer classification system, which incorporates information from cytogenetics and evidence of dysplasia to refine prognostic subgroups that may define treatment strategies.
Test_Line_8526 The panel has provided the following options for consolidation therapy for patients with better risk cytogenetics (those with CBF leukemia, without c-KIT mutations): 1) 3 to 4 cycles of high-dose cytarabine (category 1); or 2) 1 to 2 cycles of high-dose cytarabine followed by autologous HSCT (category 2B).
Test_Line_8527 This study showed similar rates of 4-year nonrelapse mortality (19% and 20%, respectively), and no difference was seen in relapse and OS rates.
Test_Line_8528 His rationale was based on similarities in the trilineage proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and disease phenotypes.
Test_Line_8529 As initially presented elsewhere, 81 patients with CMML-1 (n = 45) or CMML-2 (n = 36) were collected and investigated (Supplementary Information 1).
Test_Line_8530 We used a combination of genomic approaches, including next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry--based genotyping, to identify mutations in samples of bone marrow aspirate from 439 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_8531 EZH2 mutations, which have not previously been associated with known prognostic markers, retained a strong association with survival in our model.
Test_Line_8532 Rarely, double MPL mutations occurring in cis of exon 10 have been identified.
Test_Line_8533 Even though these measures are integrated into the IPSS, TP53 mutations remained strongly associated with shorter overall survival after adjustment for IPSS risk group (P<0.001), indicating that these mutations adversely affect survival through other means (Fig. 5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8534 Impact of spliceosome mutations on clinical outcome.
Test_Line_8535 The mutation results in impaired function of the autoinhibitory region and subsequent ligand-independent thrombopoietin receptor activation.
Test_Line_8536 Long-term haematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC).
Test_Line_8537 So far, risk stratification in PMF has been essentially based on demographic, clinical, and hematologic parameters.
Test_Line_8538 More than one quarter (26%) of the samples with at least one TET2 mutation had two distinct TET2 mutations, suggesting that biallelic loss of wild-type TET2 contributes to the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes in some cases.
Test_Line_8539 Outcomes from multiple cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation are comparable to results with autologous HSCT.
Test_Line_8540 The CR rates were similar, with 55% for the high-dose arm compared with 58% for the standard-dose arm for patients younger than 50 years, and 45% for high-dose cytarabine versus 53% for standard-dose therapy for patients 50 to 65 years of age.
Test_Line_8541 For this reason, the terms heterozygous and homozygous should generally be avoided in clinical reports.
Test_Line_8542 Approximately 45% of patients will be JAK2V617 negative and alternative diagnoses that may mimic ET should be considered, including CML, prefibrotic PMF, and PV.
Test_Line_8543 Another gene in which splicing was affected was RUNX1.
Test_Line_8544 TET2 mutations were the most prevalent genetic abnormality identified in our sample set.
Test_Line_8545 Genes that belong to the cohesin complex in somatic vertebrate cells are SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21 (SCC1), STAG2 (SA-2), and STAG1 (SA-1); these genes form a ring structure that regulates chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis.
Test_Line_8546 Further analysis involves a JAK2V617 PB mutation screen and measurement of a serum EPO level.
Test_Line_8547 Given the high-toxicity profile of INF-alpha and the questionable benefit of its nonleukemogenic properties, further research is needed to establish INF-alpha as a first-line therapy.
Test_Line_8548 Differences in survival were assessed using the log-rank test.
Test_Line_8549 Although none of the genetic abnormalities discussed earlier affect the initial course of AML treatment, they provide prognostic information that may influence subsequent treatment decisions.
Test_Line_8550 In AML, the BCOR gene is targeted by both translocations and mutations.
Test_Line_8551 Figure 1. Somatic spliceosomal gene (U2AF1, SF3B1, SRSF2, LUC7L2, PRPF8, and ZRSR2) mutations as detected by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing technologies. (A) With the use of an NGS-based whole exome sequencing analysis of whole BM DNA from a patient with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (left), a mutation of U2AF1 (21q22.3) at position 44514 777 (T > C) was detected in 13 of 18 reads. Analysis of DNA from CD3+ cells showed a much lower frequency of the base change (2 of 15 reads; right), highlighting the somatic nature of this alteration. The finding was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Arrows and bars indicate the specific nucleotide and predicted codon, respectively. It should be noted that U2AF1 is expressed from the minus strand; therefore, the NGS presentation (top panels) is complementally reversed in comparison to the Sanger sequencing results (middle panels). This heterozygous somatic mutation results in the predicted nucleotide change 470 A > G in exon 6 of the coding region, which lead to the amino acid change Q157R in the second zinc finger domain. In the entire cohort, 27 mutations were observed in 26 patients, including a whole gene deletion. All 26 missense mutations were located in 1 of the 2 zinc finger domains (ZNFs); 2 residues, S34 or Q157, were frequently affected (bottom panels). RRM indicates RNA recognition motif. (B) With the use of an NGS analysis of a patient with CMML (middle left), a mutation of SF3B1 (2q33.1) at position 198 267 491(C > G) was detected in 9 of 24 reads. The somatic nature of this alteration was confirmed by an analogous analysis of the CD3+ fraction, with the change being less frequent (2 of 23; middle right). The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (bottom). This heterozygous somatic mutation results in the nucleotide change 1866 G > T in exon 14 of SF3B1, resulting in the amino acid change E622D in the HSH155 domain. Analysis of the entire cohort identified mutations in 33 patients, including a case with a whole gene deletion. (C) Further screening by NGS led to the detection of a nonsense mutation (R27X) in LUC7L2 (7q34; top) which participates in the recognition of splice donor sites in association with the U1 snRNP spliceosomal subunit, and a missense mutation (M1307I) in PRPF8 (17p13.3; bottom) which is a large U5 snRNP-specific protein essential for pre-mRNA splicing. RS indicates serine/arginine-rich domain; U5 2-snRNA bdg, U5-snRNA binding site 2; and MPN, Mpr1p, Pad1p N-terminal domain. (D) Mutations of SRSF2, an arginine/serine-rich splicing factor, were detected in 29 cases among the entire cohort, including 2 whole gene deletions and a microdeletion within the gene (top). All mutations were heterozygous and affected P95. The somatic nature of the P95R mutation was confirmed with whole BM and T-cell rich fraction DNAs (bottom). (E)Anonsense mutation (W153X) was found in ZRSR2, another arginine/serine-rich splicing regulatory factor, in a case of CMML. ZRSR2 is located at Xp22.2, and the nonsense mutation was hemizygous in this male case (BM).
Test_Line_8552 It is known that germline mutations lead to cohesinopathies that are characterized by growth and developmental disorders in regard to the role of cohesin genes in the pathogenesis of human disease.

Test_Line_8554 These recommendations are based on a review of recently published clinical trials that have led to significant improvements in treatment or have yielded new information regarding biologic factors that may have prognostic importance.

Test_Line_8556 Another option for patients who are medically fit is the purine nucleoside analogue clofarabine (currently FDA-approved only for the treatment of relapsed or refractory pediatric ALL).
Test_Line_8557 Granulocytic dysplasia is not present, and there is no monocytosis, eosinophilia, or basophilia.
Test_Line_8558 Two specimens were found positive for the W515L mutation in all four laboratories.
Test_Line_8559 In an open-label randomized phase III study, decitabine was compared with physician's choice (either low-dose cytarabine or supportive care) in older patients (age >= 65 years) with newly diagnosed AML.
Test_Line_8560 We examined RUNX1 mutations in 81 patients with CMML at initial diagnosis.
Test_Line_8561 The investigations revealed no further significant associations, with the exception of EZH2-mutated versus EZH2 wild-type cases (Supplementary Table 5).
Test_Line_8562 The cDNA PCR was carried out in an Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany), which is composed of buffer 3 with a unique enzyme mix containing a mixture of Taq DNA polymerase and Tgo DNA polymerase (1.25 U in 25 ml); the latter is a thermostable DNA polymerase with proofreading activity.
Test_Line_8563 Patients with cohesin gene alterations had poor OS compared with patients without cohesin lesions (27.2 vs 39.9; P = .023).
Test_Line_8564 It is particularly important to identify the gene targets of possible splicing defects.
Test_Line_8565 Figure 2. Frequency and phenotypic association of spliceosomal mutations in myeloid malignancies. (A) In the entire cohort (n = 310), a total of 88 mutations in the spliceosome pathway components U2AF1, SF3B1, and SRSF2 were observed in every subtype of myeloid malignancies, except for MPN. In low-risk MDS, SF3B1 mutations were most frequent among the 3 genes. In particular, SF3B1 was mutated in 15 of 20 cases of RARS (60%). In the high-risk MDS and AML group, U2AF1 mutations were most frequent (15 of 139; 10.8%). In the MDS/MPN group, SRSF2 was most frequently mutated (13 of 46; 28.2%), whereas SF3B1 is mutated at a high frequency in RARS-T (10 of 11; 90.1%). (B) Effect of spliceosomal mutations on clinical outcomes. In the entire cohort, patients with U2AF1 mutations (MT) had worse OS, compared with WT, but SF3B1 mutations made OS significantly shorter. In low-risk MDS, mutation of SF3B1 was a good prognostic factor, but SRSF2 mutations are associated with worse prognosis. In MDS/MPN, patients with mutated U2AF1 had a shorter OS, but SF3B1 mutations were associated with significantly better prognosis. In addition, SRSF2 mutations did not affect outcomes.
Test_Line_8566 EZH2 mutations were spread over several exons, but predominantly were located in the four conserved regions and, in particular, 6/10 mutations were located in the conserved catalytic SET (enhancer of zeste and trithorax) domain (amino acids 618-751), essential for the methyltransferase activity of EZH2 (Supplementary Table 4).
Test_Line_8567 Patients with t(8;21) or inv(16)/t(16;16) with c-KIT mutation are categorized as having intermediate risk AML (see "Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities," on page 995).
Test_Line_8568 The L359V mutation and the deletion of codons 341-346 have been exclusively identified in myeloid transformation of chronic myeloid leukemias and are acquired.
Test_Line_8569 This analysis suggested that RIC allogeneic HSCT was associated with improved relapse-free survival, and the authors concluded that this approach remains of interest.
Test_Line_8570 Despite the demonstrated role of cohesin in mitosis, the mechanism by which altered cohesin function leads to clonal expansion and malignant transformation has not been elucidated.
Test_Line_8571 Tagged next-generation amplicon deep-sequencing primer sequences are available online (Supplementary Table 3).
Test_Line_8572 The L359V has an opposite effect to the T354M and M355del mutations, with a gain of function effect for the former and a loss of function for the latter.
Test_Line_8573 The period taken into account was the time interval from birth to the first date when the event was observed or when no event occurred to the last examination.
Test_Line_8574 Whether the same set of genes is subject to altered epigenetic patterning in DNMT3A-mutant AML cells has not been investigated.
Test_Line_8575 The prognostic significance of point mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes may be driven by the association of these mutations with risk factors, including karyotype, blast proportion, and cytopenias, which are captured by existing clinical risk scoring systems such as the IPSS.
Test_Line_8576 Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis and PCR-SSCP of the entire coding region showed that none of the AML cases had LOH or mutation. Only one frameshift mutation at codon 130 (insertion of CCCG) with premature termination of coding sequence was observed in the U937 cell line.
Test_Line_8577 PMF.
Test_Line_8578 There were no significant differences in the clinicohematological features between RUNX1 mutationpositive and RUNX1 mutation-negative groups.
Test_Line_8579 A diagnosis of PV can be made when JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutation is detected, along with increased hemoglobin and low or normal levels of erythropoietin.
Test_Line_8580 Bruising (bleeding events related to skin and subcutaneous tissue) (see the Supplementary Appendix) was assessed separately.
Test_Line_8581 2-HG is present at markedly elevated levels in the serum of patients with AML harbouring IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, suggesting that 2-HG could be a biomarker for IDH-mutant AML.
Test_Line_8582 Ruxolitinib, as compared with placebo, provided significant clinical benefits in patients with myelofibrosis by reducing spleen size, ameliorating debilitating myelofibrosis-related symptoms, and improving overall survival.
Test_Line_8583 Approximately half the grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia events (11 of 20) occurred during the first 8 weeks of treatment (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix) and led to dose adjustments or brief treatment interruptions.
Test_Line_8584 Individual disclosures for the NCCN Acute Myeloid Leukemia Panel members can be found on page 1021. (The most recent version of these guidelines and accompanying disclosures are available on the NCCN Web site at NCCN.org.) These guidelines are also available on the Internet.
Test_Line_8585 Patients with antecedent hematologic disease or treatment-related secondary leukemia are considered poor-risk, unless they have favorable cytogenetics, such as t(8;21), inv(16), t(16;16), or t(15;17).

(C) VAFs of STAG2 mutations by deep sequencing in serial samples. For each STAG2 mutant patient with available serial samples, the VAF in each sampling is shown. Although only 2 patients were found to harbor a STAG2 mutation in the dominant clone at the first time point, 7 out of 8 patients (87.5%) who were initially found to have a subclonal STAG2 mutation underwent clonal expansion, becoming the dominant clone at the time of transformation (P = .05). (D) VAFs of SMC3 and RAD21 mutations by deep sequencing in serial samples. For 4 patients with SMC3 mutations and the 1 patient with a RAD21 mutation with available serial samples, the VAF in each sampling is shown. All of these 5 patients harbored subclonal cohesin mutations at the first time point, with 2 out of 4 (50%) of the SMC3 mutant patients and the 1 out of 1 RAD21 mutant patient undergoing clonal expansion, becoming the dominant clone at the time of transformation.
Test_Line_8587 The above difference in risk of thrombosis remained statistically significant after adjusting for age.
Test_Line_8588 A median of 498 reads per amplicon (range 162-740) were obtained for IDH1, IDH2, NPM1 and EZH2, thus yielding a sufficient coverage for mutation detection with high sensitivity.
Test_Line_8589 Overall, in our cohort of 81 cases, only 15 (18.5%) remained in which no mutation was detectable.
Test_Line_8590 Statistical analysis of clinical data.
Test_Line_8591 Only 3 of these mutations (L359V, T354M, and M355del) have been functionally tested by gel-shift or luciferase assays.
Test_Line_8592 GATA2 mutations are identified in chronic neutropenia.

Test_Line_8594 An international randomized phase III study by Fenaux et al compared the hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine with conventional care (best supportive care, low-dose cytarabine, or intensive chemotherapy) in patients with MDS (N = 358).
Test_Line_8595 Figure 2. Proposed Diagnostic Strategy for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN). Initial Screening Should Be for BCR-ABL1. Positive Test is Diagnostic for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). If Clinical Suspicion Exists for BCR-ABL1 Negative MPN, Then Screen for JAK2V617F Mutation. JAK2 is Diagnostic for MPN. Bone Marrow (BM) Biopsy is Required for Diagnosis of Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF), and Can Be Helpful in JAK2 Negative Polycythemia Vera (PV).
Test_Line_8596 She underwent treatment with intensive chemotherapy that was complicated by pulmonary aspergillosis.
Test_Line_8597 Although mutations of R140 in IDH2 exclusively result in the substitution of arginine to glutamine (IDH2-R140Q), mutations affecting IDH1-R132 or IDH2-R172 consist of a broader range of amino-acid substitutions (IDH1-R132H, IDH1-R132C, IDH2-R172K, IDH2-R172M and IDH2-R172S).
Test_Line_8598 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_8599 After excluding 7 polymorphisms and 9 silent mutations, 13 different aberrations (Supplementary Table 4) were detected in IDH1 (1/81; 1.2%), IDH2 (3/81; 3.7%), NPM1 (1/81; 1.2%) and EZH2 (9/81; 11.1%).
Test_Line_8600 TET1, but not TET2, can recruit Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) through direct binding to the trans criptional regulator SIN3A.
Test_Line_8601 Because of the large numbers of diverse mutations, large studies will be needed to fully evaluate the correlation between the mutation status of spliceosomal genes and other genes in a proper fashion.
Test_Line_8602 The presence of reactive thrombosis does not exclude a diagnosis of essential thrombocytosis in the presence of 3 other major criteria.
Test_Line_8603 This mutation has also been observed in conjunction with NPM1 mutations and FLT3 mutations.
Test_Line_8604 The exception is an MDS subtype, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, in which the frequency of JAK2V617F mutation is estimated to be 50%.
Test_Line_8605 CR, complete remission; HI-E, hematologic improvement (erythroid); IWG, International Working Group; PR, partial remission; SD, stable disease.
Test_Line_8606 Rasburicase is a genetically engineered recombinant form of urate oxidase enzyme.
Test_Line_8607 Some karyotypic abnormalities, such as deletion of chromosome 5q, help establish the prognosis and may be associated with a specific clinical phenotype.
Test_Line_8608 HpaII digests 5'-CCGG-3' sites when the cytosine in the central CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated, whereas MspI digests methylated and unmethylated DNA at those sites.
Test_Line_8609 Most clinical and disease characteristics of patients with mutations in the cohesin complex were similarly distributed, as in patients with wild-type cohesin genes (Table 1).
Test_Line_8610 Moreover, no homozygous mutations were found in patients with UPD21q (n = 8).
Test_Line_8611 Practice guidelines also serve to identify questions and suggest areas for future development.
Test_Line_8612 Mutation Analysis of PTEN/MMAC1 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Test_Line_8613 However, clinical outcome, even in patients with normal karyotype AML (NK-AML), is heterogeneous.
Test_Line_8614 Similarly, heterozygous, somatic SF3B1 mutations (E622D) were detected in a patient with refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS) associated with marked thrombocytosis (RARS-T; Figure 1B).
Test_Line_8615 In patients with t(8;21), c-KIT mutations were also associated with a higher incidence of relapse at 5 years (70% vs. 36%: P = .017), but no differences were observed in 5-year OS (42% vs. 48%).
Test_Line_8616 Cytokine-driven neutrophilia accompanying plasma cell neoplasms is a well-described association.
Test_Line_8617 Therefore, it is important for physicians to submit sufficient samples to reserve aliquots of cryopreserved marrow from the time of diagnosis to allow for molecular diagnostic tests in patients with normal karyotype.
Test_Line_8618 Analogous to previously applied strategies that identified TET2, CBL, EZH2, and other mutations, we have identified mutations affecting, in a recurrent fashion, genes of the spliceosome machinery, using a combination of targeted search approaches and unbiased mass sequencing.
Test_Line_8619 Notably, mutations in EZH2 were associated with impaired survival in MDS but not with an increased risk of transformation to AML; these data suggest a differential role for PRC2 function in acute and chronic myeloid malignancies, which is supported by the current absence of reported EZH2 mutations in de novo AML.
Test_Line_8620 More recently, mutational profiling of a large cohort of patients with MDS reported that mutations in EZH2 were associated with worsened overall survival, independent of known clinical predictors of worsened survival in MDS such as the International Prognostic Scoring System (TABLE 1).
Test_Line_8621 Although HSCT was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonrelapse mortality (21% vs. 3%; P < .001), the 3-year OS rate showed a survival benefit with HSCT (62% vs. 51%; P = .012).
Test_Line_8622 In the subgroup of cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), additional mutation analyses were performed for CEBPA, MLL-PTD, WT1, and WT1 SNP rs16754, NRAS, and expression levels of BAALC, ERG, EVI1, MN1, MLL5, and WT1 were quantified as previously described using complementary DNA from the KG1A cell line (BAALC, ERG, MLL5), plasmids (MN1, WT1), or from a patient sample (EVI1) to construct a relative standard curve using ABL as a housekeeping gene (Ipsogen, Marseille, France).
Test_Line_8623 Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) is an uncommon myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative (MDS/MPN) neoplasm, with a relative incidence estimated at 1 to 2 cases for every 100 patients with BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
Test_Line_8624 A lower allelic burden in PMF is associated with decreased leukemic-free survival and an inferior prognosis.
Test_Line_8625 In addition, we identified 8 deletions involving STAG2 (chromosome X) or RAD21 (chromosome 8) (supplemental Figure 3 and supplemental Table 3).
Test_Line_8626 Somatic mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene have been identified in a number of cancer cell lines and primary cancers, and most frequently found in advanced cancers.
Test_Line_8627 In addition to the discovery in patients with myeloid malignancies of mutations in genes that primarily function in regulating DNA methylation or post-translational histone modifications, various previously characterized class I and class II alleles have recently been found to affect the epigenome as part of their transforming activity.
Test_Line_8628 For patients with RUNX1 mutations, no significant difference was observed between the locations of mutations (N-terminal vs C-terminal) or between the patterns of mutations (missense vs frameshift/nonsense) with respect to the clinicohematological features, overall survival or time to AML transformation (Supplementary Table 2).
Test_Line_8629 Patient number 5758 (P4, III, 1) presented with numerous and extensive warts associated with a mild neutropenia since the age of 6, a profound monocytopenia, and deficiencies of B cells and NK cells (Table 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_8630 The TET family of proteins was first identified with the cloning of TET1 as a fusion partner of MLL in patients with t(10;11)(q22;q23) AML.
Test_Line_8631 Category 3: Based upon any level of evidence, there is major NCCN disagreement that the intervention is appropriate.
Test_Line_8632 In addition, the 2-year death rate in CR was significantly lower in the ambulatory arm (0% vs. 5%; P = .04) and no differences were observed in the cumulative relapse rate between arms.
Test_Line_8633 Figure 1. Pedigree description. P1 to P7 describes the pedigrees. Circles represent females and squares males. Parents are connected by a single horizontal line, and vertical lines indicate their offspring. Offspring are connected by a horizontal line. Siblings are placed from left to right according to birth order and are labeled with Arabic numerals. Each generation is indicated by a Roman numeral. Circles and squares are black when neutropenias have been formally identified. If a patient is dead, a diagonal line is placed over the circle or square. Smaller circles with a diagonal line indicate miscarriage (P1, III, 4; P1, III, 6) or termination because of AML induction treatment (P1, III, 7). Patients tested are indicated by the result of the GATA2 screening and a number (patient number 7107 was not analyzed). The absence (wild-type, WT) or presence of a GATA2 mutation (protein variation or complete deletion indicated by Delta) is indicated below the symbol of the patient tested.
Test_Line_8634 A similar high mutation burden was also detected in RUNX1 (median 46.7%), TET2 (median 44.6%) and CBL (median 42.5%), whereas the burden was low in RAS pathway alterations, that is, NRAS (median 11.1%), KRAS (median 27%) or JAK2 V617F mutations (median 6.9%).
Test_Line_8635 Mechanistically, defective splicing of specific genes may have similar consequences to loss of function mutations through the retention of introns (supplemental Figure 9).
Test_Line_8636 Absence of both BCR-ABL1 and rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1 are minimal diagnostic requirements for CNL and aCML.
Test_Line_8637 SF3B1 mutations were found in 68-82 % of refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RSRS) and 57-76 % of refractory cytopenia with ring sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).
Test_Line_8638 High-dose cytarabine, when used as part of induction therapy, may substitute for intrathecal chemotherapy because it crosses the blood-brain barrier; the CSF must then be reassessed after completion of induction therapy, and further therapy should be given as appropriate.
Test_Line_8639 The initial step in an accurate diagnosis must be the exclusion of the BCR-ABL1 translocation in patients who present with signs, symptoms, or laboratory values consistent with PV, ET, or PMF.
Test_Line_8640 Genetic alterations of the cohesin complex genes in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_8641 In this analysis of 389 well-characterized patients with AML, we identified somatic mutations in the cohesin complex in 5.9% of patients.
Test_Line_8642 A well-thought-out plan for salvage therapy with either a matched sibling or unrelated donor HSCT should be an important part of the treatment decision for these patients.
Test_Line_8643 She had a history of recurrent gingivitis and skin infection consistent with chronic neutropenia (12 years before AML) and monocytopenia.
Test_Line_8644 Thrombocytopenia rarely recurred at a grade 3 or 4 level after appropriate dose modifications and was not associated with an increase in bleeding events, although bruising was more common in the ruxolitinib group.
Test_Line_8645 The terms heterozygous and homozygous have been used in the literature to describe cases with allele burdens of <50% and >=50%, respectively, but this terminology is potentially misleading.
Test_Line_8646 RNA sequencing from TCGA patients was downloaded from the TCGA repository.
Test_Line_8647 Total RNA was extracted from BM mononuclear cells with the use of the Nucleospin RNA II Kit (Macherey-Nagel) with DNAase treatment.
Test_Line_8648 However, the percentage of patients achieving a CR who did not proceed to consolidation was twice as high in the high-dose cytarabine induction arm.
Test_Line_8649 STAG2 and SMC1A are X-linked, whereas the other 3 genes are autosomal.
Test_Line_8650 How Should the Results of JAK2 and MPL Mutation Testing Be Reported?
Test_Line_8651 The e19/a2 type BCR/ABL mRNA transcript (p230) that was initially reported as the molecular basis for some cases of CNL is instead now considered related to an uncommon neutrophilic variant of CML.
Test_Line_8652 The use of these parameters led to the definition of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which identifies 4 prognostic groups with substantially different survival in PMF.
Test_Line_8653 Significant covariates were dichotomized at their medians, and resulting 2-group log-rank test differences were visualized using Kaplan-Meier methods.
Test_Line_8654 In contrast to previously reported findings in smaller sample sets, neither monoallelic nor bi-allelic mutations were associated with IPSS risk group or overall survival (Fig. 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8655 In addition to RUNX1 and CEBPA mutations, monosomy 7 was associated with pure familial MDS/AML in 14 pedigrees with an autosomal-dominant transmission and a young age (< 18 years).
Test_Line_8656 An additional post hoc analysis showed an improvement of 50% or more in nonabdominal symptoms (night sweats, bone or muscle pain, and pruritus) in 58.6% of patients with reductions in spleen volume of 35% or more and in 54.1% of patients with reductions in spleen volume of less than 35%.
Test_Line_8657 Subsequent biochemical studies demonstrated that 2-HG inhibits TET family members as alpha-ketoglutarate is an essential cofactor of TET and its levels are reduced by the production of 2-HG.
Test_Line_8658 Figure 2. Provisional diagnostic algorithm for neutrophilia and genetically informed treatment options. FISH probes for myeloid-associated cytogenetic abnormalities can be used to complement standard karyotype analysis to establish the presence of a clonal myeloid disorder. Cytogenetic/FISH or molecular evaluation of rearranged PDGFRA/B, and FGFR1 should also be considered if eosinophilia is present. Testing for JAK2 V617F, infrequently identified in CNL or atypical CML, should also be considered. The list of relevant mutations, including molecular abnormalities in complementary signaling pathways to CSF3R and SETBP1, may expand over time. For patients who are CSF3R-mutation negative, use of a JAK inhibitor (particularly if JAK2 V617F positive) or SRC kinase inhibitor could be considered since mutations in the same or related signaling pathways may be present.
Test_Line_8659 SETBP1 mutations in aCML were associated with higher white blood cell counts at diagnosis and poorer survival.
Test_Line_8660 The TET enzymes can also convert 5-mC to 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC); 5-caC can be directly recognized and repaired by TDG-mediated BER (an enzymatic activity that is unable to excise 5-hmC or 5-mC).
Test_Line_8661 However, if neurologic symptoms (eg, headache, confusion, altered sensory input) are present at diagnosis, an initial CT/MRI should be performed to rule out the possibility of intracranial hemorrhage or presence of mass/lesion.
Test_Line_8662 We compared the characteristics of the study patients with mutations, using the appropriate statistical methods, as detailed in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Test_Line_8663 The median time to AML transformation in patients with RUNX1 mutations was 23.3 months compared with 28.3 months for those without RUNX1 mutations (P = 0.175, Figure 2b).
Test_Line_8664 In the ruxolitinib group, 41.9% of patients met the defined response threshold of a reduction of 35% or more in spleen volume, and nearly all the patients had some reduction in spleen volume.
Test_Line_8665 Thus, success in these trials may be assessed using indirect measures, such as hematologic improvement or decreased transfusion requirements and survival, without actually achieving CR.
Test_Line_8666 Allele Burden.
Test_Line_8667 Blood versus Bone Marrow Initial testing of JAK2 and MPL mutations is most commonly performed on peripheral blood samples.
Test_Line_8668 Patients were registered in the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry, which was established in 1993 to collect data from 35 pediatric hematology-oncology clinical units.
Test_Line_8669 Here, we review how specific somatic alterations in epigenetic regulators lead to repatterning of the epigenome and contribute to myeloid leukaemogenesis.
Test_Line_8670 Serial studies performed on patients from the initial diagnosis of low-risk MDS through subsequent transformation indicate that U2AF1 mutations may represent early ancestral events.
Test_Line_8671 Recently, a more diverse range of missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations in EZH2 were identified in patients with myeloid malignancies, most commonly PRC2 complex in MDS, CMML and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and rarely in other chronic or acute myeloid malignancies (FIG. 2; TABLE 1).
Test_Line_8672 Median remission duration was 45 months for the high-dose arm, compared with 12 months for the standard treatment arm.
Test_Line_8673 In both reports, the authors revealed that the oncogenicity of IDH1 mutants in neural and haematopoietic cells may depend on the increased activity of the EGLN family, which are alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylases that normally mark the oxygen-labile subunit of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) for proteasomal degradation.
Test_Line_8674 The 2 mutations in SMC1A were both missense mutations (Figure 1 and supplemental Table 6).
Test_Line_8675 The discovery that the TET family of enzymes places novel modifications on cytosine-methylated DNA has led to rapidly increasing insight into the biological function of modified DNA cytosine residues.
Test_Line_8676 The possible role of PRC1 alterations in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_8677 The karyotype identified a translocation involving MLL along with a monosomy 7.
Test_Line_8678 Participation in a clinical trial investigating novel agents may also be appropriate for patients with a performance status score of greater than 2 without significant comorbid conditions.
Test_Line_8679 Effects of spliceosomal mutations on spliceosomal function.
Test_Line_8680 The BM smear did not identify myelokathexis features and the case was considered to be a WHIM-like syndrome.
Test_Line_8681 Five patients had more than one episode of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia.
Test_Line_8682 In this analysis, the cohort was significantly separated into three prognostic risk groups, that is, at 3 years 33.9% of EZH2-mutated patients, 49.7% of EZH2/TET2 wild-type patients and 89.8% of TET2-mutated cases were alive (P<0.001).
Test_Line_8683 As expected, age and IPSS risk group were strongly associated with overall survival (Table 2).
Test_Line_8684 Whether this pattern is due to an acquired uniparental disomy 7q as described as common abnormality in the literature for myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm is not known.
Test_Line_8685 Adverse effects may be attenuated with prophylactic cytoreduction when using hydroxyurea.
Test_Line_8686 Overall, the main clinical features identified in these patients are the presence of warts at the initial diagnosis, frequent infections, and evolution to MDS and/or AML.
Test_Line_8687 Preliminary trials incorporating FLT3 inhibitors either as part of induction or postremission therapy (including post-HSCT) continue; however, the agents currently under investigation have shown only minimal impact.
Test_Line_8688 The role of follow-up testing for JAK2 and MPL mutations after therapy is not clearly established.
Test_Line_8689 Treatment strategies for relapse are categorized according to patient age.
Test_Line_8690 Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study patients are detailed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Test_Line_8691 The outcome once the MDS or the AML occurred was extremely poor: none of the patients treated only by chemotherapy was alive in contrast to the 6 patients receiving HSCT (Table 1).
Test_Line_8692 In addition, most of the aberrant transcripts of PTEN/MMAC1 were caused by intragenic deletions.
Test_Line_8693 In contrast to the V617F mutation, which involves one amino acid codon, exon 12 mutations affect a larger region, spanning codons 533 to 547.
Test_Line_8694 Analysis of a large series of CN-AML patients suggests that BCOR mutations may confer a poorer prognosis.
Test_Line_8695 The identification of somatic mutations of calreticulin has substantially modified our knowledge of PMF.
Test_Line_8696 Monocytosis and basophilia are not prominent (<2% peripheral blood basophils, <10% peripheral blood monocytes), and the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase level may be low, normal, or increased, therefore lacking diagnostic utility.
Test_Line_8697 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_8698 Table 1. Clinical characteristics of patients participating in this study.
Test_Line_8699 EZH2 mutations constitute a novel poor prognostic risk group and, moreover, had the strongest clinical impact of all markers analyzed thus far.
Test_Line_8700 The guidelines note that RIC allogeneic HSCT is considered an additional option for patients aged 60 years and older for the following situations: 1) as postremission therapy in those experiencing a CR to induction therapy, or 2) as treatment of induction failure (in the context of a clinical trial) only in patients with low-volume disease.
Test_Line_8701 Another patient (no. 21) had two frameshift mutations in RHD; eight clones harbored 297_298insGGAC resulting in Thr101fsX111 and nine clones harbored 343_344insGG resulting in Ala115fsX118, the remaining one clone was wild type.
Test_Line_8702 ASXL1 has few well-characterized domains, but it does have a conserved carboxyl-terminal PHD domain and a putative DNA-binding domain and is not thought to possess enzymatic activity.
Test_Line_8703 CONCLUSION.
Test_Line_8704 In addition to its role as an intermediate in DNA demethylation, 5-hmC has recently been identified to have at least another specific gene regulatory function.
Test_Line_8705 Age >65 years old, hemoglobin level <10 g/dL, leukocyte count >25 x 109/L, circulating blasts >=1%, and the presence of constitutional symptoms are considered negative predictive risk factors by the International Prognostic Scoring System.
Test_Line_8706 A recent analysis that evaluated the prognostic value of the ELN risk classification (based on data from the German AML96 study) showed that for patients aged 60 years and younger, median relapse-free survival was shorter for the Intermediate I than for the Intermediate II group (7.9 vs. 39.1 months, respectively).
Test_Line_8707 Both patients with SMC1A mutations were male.
Test_Line_8708 To minimize false positives and focus on the most prevalent or relevant somatic events, we implemented a rational bioanalytic filtering approach and applied heuristic bioanalytic pipelines.
Test_Line_8709 Rasburicase should be considered as initial treatment in patients with rapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or evidence of impaired renal function.
Test_Line_8710 Recent studies of cohesin dynamics at super enhancer sites are in line with these conclusions: cohesin localizes to sites of high mediator occupancy at the enhancer-promoter interaction sites in lymphoma and myeloma.
Test_Line_8711 Reported P-values are two-sided and not corrected for multiple testing.
Test_Line_8712 Multivariate analysis of OS was carried out by Cox regression.
Test_Line_8713 S9A and S9B in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8714 Mutations listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information's SNP database (dbSNP, build 130), previously reported as germ line, or present in the buccal sample from any patient in our cohort were considered to be germ line and were excluded from further analysis (Table 5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8715 The panel members agreed that transplant-based options (either matched sibling or alternate donor allogeneic HSCT, or 1-2 cycles of dose-intensive cytarabine followed by autologous HSCT) afforded a lower risk of relapse and a somewhat higher DFS as consolidation for most patients with intermediaterisk cytogenetics.
Test_Line_8716 Additionally, we identified 4 patients with mutations in RAD21 and 2 patients with mutations in SMC1A (Figure 1).
Test_Line_8717 Eight cases included with therapy-related myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_8718 Similarly to mutations of BCOR, most of the alterations affecting BCORL1 were nonsense mutations, out-of-frame insertions/deletions or splice site mutations that, although not resulting in clearly diminished mRNA levels of BCORL1, were predicted to encode truncated proteins lacking the last C-terminal LXXLL nuclear receptor recruitment motif.
Test_Line_8719 Diagnoses of PMF and that of leukemic transformation (blast phase) were performed in accordance with the 2008 WHO criteria.
Test_Line_8720 On the basis of such findings, PTEN/MMAC1 has been considered a candidate tumor suppressor gene that may play a role in varied malignancies. Chromosome 10q23.3 is deleted in a variety of primary tumors including myeloid leukemia.
Test_Line_8721 Subsequently, we studied the effect of the most common spliceosomal mutations on clinical outcomes.
Test_Line_8722 Results from different methods may differ with respect to analytical sensitivity, specificity, and clinical relevance.
Test_Line_8723 This mutation is present in approximately 96% of PV cases, 55% of ET cases, and 65% of PMF cases.
Test_Line_8724 For patients younger than 60 years who have experienced a relapse, enrollment in clinical trials is considered an appropriate strategy and is a strongly preferred option by the panel.
Test_Line_8725 Dawson et al showed that JAK2 localizes to the nucleus and phosphorylates Y41 of histone H3.
Test_Line_8726 In addition, there was no difference between CR rates of mutated and wild-type patients (mutated 83% vs wild-type 76%; P = .45).
Test_Line_8727 Mutation descriptors are not translated into the standard HGVS nomenclature, to avoid misinterpretation.
Test_Line_8728 In 2003, the International Working Group for the Diagnosis and Standardization of Response Criteria accepted the cytochemical and immunophenotypic criteria of WHO as the standard for diagnosing AML, including the reporting of dysplasia according to morphology.
Test_Line_8729 cDNA PCR or DNA PCR assay with direct sequencing for RUNX1 mutation analysis.
Test_Line_8730 Thirty-three patients had progressed to AML, which was defined as the presence of >=20% blasts in BM or peripheral blood.
Test_Line_8731 No significant differences were observed between the intermediate- and high-dose arms in rates of CR (80% vs. 82%), 5-year EFS (34% vs. 35%), or 5-year OS (40% vs. 42%), results that seem comparable to those from the CALGB study with high-dose cytarabine.
Test_Line_8732 The OS of cohesin-mutated patients with a related donor was similar compared with patients without a related donor (OS: HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.06-4.8; P = .58; supplemental Figure 4A-B), suggesting that cohesin gene mutations did not influence the outcome of allogeneic transplantation.
Test_Line_8733 FLT3-ITD occurs in approximately 30% of cases and is more common than FLT3-TKD mutations, which occur in approximately 10% of patients.
Test_Line_8734 We identified 2 cases with germline known rare nonsynonymous alterations, specifically a germline alteration in STAG1 (p.E760D) with population allelic frequency of 0.01, and a novel alteration in WAPAL (p.G230V; supplemental Table 4).
Test_Line_8735 Although such testing is still not standard for diagnosing MPNs, the findings from the sample exchange study provide hope that quantitative testing will be reliable when such testing becomes standard practice.
Test_Line_8736 Thus, NPM1 mutation confers favorable prognosis only in the absence of FLT3-ITD.
Test_Line_8737 With either high- or standard-dose cytarabinebased induction for younger patients, between 20% and 45% of these patients will not enter remission.
Test_Line_8738 The samples were from patients representative of the general population of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8739 The functional consequence of these truncations is altered and increased receptor activity conferring ligand hypersensitivity.
Test_Line_8740 This phosphorylation causes downregulation of PRMT5 activity and blocks the specific interaction of PRMT5 with methylosome protein 50 (MEP50).
Test_Line_8741 For this strategy to be better used, potential transplant options should be considered during induction therapy, and unrelated donor options/searches explored earlier in the disease management.
Test_Line_8742 In a phase II study in patients aged 60 years and older (N = 55; median age, 74 years), the CR rate with this agent (20 mg/m2/d for 5 days) was 24% (including 6/24 patients [24%] with poor-risk cytogenetics), and the median EFS and OS were 6 and 8 months, respectively.
Test_Line_8743 Many of the newer treatment strategies are designed to work more gradually using agents that may allow expression of tumor suppressor genes (eg, a methyltransferase inhibitor such as decitabine or 5-azacytidine) or increase apoptosis (eg, histone deacetylase inhibitors).
Test_Line_8744 The genetic, epigenetic and functional data suggest that TET2 and IDH mutations form a novel mutational complementation group in myeloid leukaemia, and indicate that mutational studies may identify additional disease alleles that alter DNA hydroxymethylation in different malignancies.
Test_Line_8745 Importantly, most TET2 mutations are heterozygous in leukaemia, and the expression of the wild-type allele is retained.
Test_Line_8746 Warts were considered when they numbered >= 10 or when they presented as genital condylomata acuminata.
Test_Line_8747 The prognostic relevance of RUNX1 mutations in CMML has not been determined earlier.
Test_Line_8748 Using standard curves for both the wild-type and mutant forms, it is possible to perform this calculation; however, there is no standardization for measuring quantity.
Test_Line_8749 The amplicons were purified using a gel extraction kit (Geneclean III Kit, Bio101, Inc., Vista, CA) and then sequenced using SequiTherm EXCEL II DNA Sequencing Kit (Epientre Technologies, Madison, WI). The sequencing primers were the same as those used for the PCR-SSCP.
Test_Line_8750 Second, known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were removed (dbSNP, version 137).
Test_Line_8751 A similar proportion of patients in each treatment arm received consolidation with a third chemotherapy cycle (26%-27%), autologous HSCT (10%-11%), and allogeneic HSCT (27%-29%).
Test_Line_8752 Genomic DNA PCR amplification was performed using another exon-specific primer pair with earlier published sequences for mutation confirmation.
Test_Line_8753 As illustrated in Figure 7, at least 3 genetic subgroups should now be taken into account in the interpretation of results: CALR-mutant, JAK2/MPL mutant, and triple-negative patients.
Test_Line_8754 This criterion provides a measure of the relative goodness of fit of a statistical model and a means for comparison among models, a lower AIC value indicating a better tradeoff between fit and complexity.
Test_Line_8755 In this situation, it is necessary for the laboratory to establish the minimal amount of signal needed to confidently call a sample positive.
Test_Line_8756 At the time of the prospectively defined data cutoff (median follow-up, 32 weeks), 134 patients in the ruxolitinib group (86.5%) and 78 in the placebo group (50.6%) were receiving the randomly assigned study drug.
Test_Line_8757 Ninety-three percent of patients with PMF showed a decrease in spleen size of >20 cm.
Test_Line_8758 Only mutations in the TP53 gene have been clearly associated with poor prognostic markers, such as a complex karyotype (having three or more chromosomal abnormalities), and have been reported to independently predict survival among patients at intermediate risk, as ascertained with the use of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS).
Test_Line_8759 Four patients, which concomitantly harbored an EZH2 and TET2 mutation, were added into the EZH2-mutated group, as EZH2 mutations are believed to be an early event in the disease process and precede the sequential acquisition of TET2 mutations and because EZH2 mutations remained significant in the multivariate analyses in contrast to TET2 (Supplementary Information 2).
Test_Line_8760 Less conspicuously, SF3B1 mutations were confined to 5-7 amino acid positions within the domains corresponding to exons 14-15, of which *50 % of the mutations were accounted for the K700E.
Test_Line_8761 When transfusion support is required, leukocyte-depleted blood products should be used for transfusion.
Test_Line_8762 Patients with low cohesin gene expression showed similar expression signatures as those with somatic cohesin mutations.
Test_Line_8763 The first reported pegylated INF-alpha (90 mug/week) induced hematologic remission in approximately 80% of patients with PV and 81% of patients with ET (complete remission in 70% with PV and 76% with ET) and molecular remission in 54% of patients with PV and 38% with ET.
Test_Line_8764 To determine the expression levels of EVI1, relative quantification was calculated using the equation 2- Delta Delta Ct, as previously described.
Test_Line_8765 Anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most frequent hematologic adverse events (overall and grade 3 or 4 events) (Table 2) and a reason for treatment discontinuation in one patient in each study-drug group for each event.
Test_Line_8766 Thus, azacitidine would be expected to have greater efficacy in cohesin-deficient patients.
Test_Line_8767 ASSOCIATIONS OF MUTATIONS WITH CYTOGENETIC FEATURES AND CYTOPENIAS.
Test_Line_8768 Most frequently, MDS and AML are sporadic and affect primarily elderly patients with a median age more than 65 years.
Test_Line_8769 A higher cross-sectional prevalence among advanced cases suggests that both U2AF1 and SRSF2 constitute high-risk defects.
Test_Line_8770 Exon 12 mutations are far less common, present in only approximately 3% of PV cases.
Test_Line_8771 Statistical methods.
Test_Line_8772 Historically, in most large cooperative group trials, daunorubicin has been the most commonly used anthracycline at doses of 45 to 60 mg/m2 x 3 days.
Test_Line_8773 The somatic or germline status of mutations in genes of the cohesin complex was established by evaluating remission samples or T cells (CD3+ CD11b- CD14- CD3+) purified from diagnostic samples by flow
Test_Line_8774 S3A, S3B, and S3C in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8775 Jason Gotlib; Julia E. Maxson; Tracy I. George;Jeffrey W. Tyner.
Test_Line_8776 This error can be easily avoided by restricting exon 12 testing only to a reflex test.
Test_Line_8777 Patients who received at least 4 cycles of treatment were assessed by modified International Working Group criteria.
Test_Line_8778 METHODS.
Test_Line_8779 Only the mutation in R381Q of SMC3 was recurrent in 2 patients, whereas all other mutations were only identified once (Figure 1 and supplemental Table 4).
Test_Line_8780 The induction therapy of AML was complicated by lung aspergillosis in 2 patients of 4 who have received this therapeutic approach, and 1 additional patient (patient number 5593) suffered from lung aspergillosis along with genital cancer.
Test_Line_8781 Recent genomic studies have identified novel recurrent somatic mutations in patients with myeloid malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Test_Line_8782 This subclonal architecture occurs in the setting of cooccurring genetic and molecular abnormalities, including mutations in chromatin modifiers (ASXL1) and key transcriptional regulators (RUNX1, Ras family genes, and BCOR).
Test_Line_8783 Median overall survival was 17.7 years in CALR-mutant, 9.2 years in JAK2-mutant, 9.1 years in MPL-mutant, and 3.2 years in triple-negative patients.
Test_Line_8784 Five deaths were recorded, 3 as a direct consequence of the leukemic evolution (patient numbers 6227, 5758, and 5677), 1 related to a flu-mediated pneumonia in a patient in complete remission of AML with immunodeficiency (patient number 6184), and 1 in a patient who died from an aortic dissection at the age of 36 (patient number 7107).
Test_Line_8785 When dichotomized using a threshold expression of < mean - 2 standard deviations (95% confidence interval) as a cutoff value, 10% to 20% of cases showed decreased cohesin expression (Figure 5A-B).
Test_Line_8786 Overall, nonhematologic adverse events occurred at a similar rate in the two groups.
Test_Line_8787 Moreover, cohesin gene mutations were screened using whole-exome sequencing results available through TCGA (http://tcga-data.nci.nih. gov/tcga/tcgaHome2.jsp).
Test_Line_8788 In contrast, mutations in other genes can lead to unsplicing of distinct genes and thereby result in particular phenotypic features.
Test_Line_8789 The 2 reads originated from contamination by a small amount of the mutated clone.
Test_Line_8790 To further examine the impact of driver mutations on the clinical course of the disease, we subdivided PMF patients into 2 subgroups according to their IPSS risk: the "lower-risk" subgroup included patients with low or intermediate-1 IPSS risk, whereas the "higher-risk" subgroup included patients with intermediate-2 or high IPSS risk.
Test_Line_8791 The genetic subtypes of PMF differ substantially as regards clinical course, disease progression, and overall survival.
Test_Line_8792 Because JAK2 and MPL mutations are not completely specific for MPN, finding of these mutations in isolation does not warrant a diagnosis of MPN.
Test_Line_8793 For example, it is unclear how JAK2 (or JAK1 (REF. 95)) enters the nucleus, as the JAKs do not contain known nuclear-localization sequences.
Test_Line_8794 Compared to typical APL cases with t(15;17), this patient showed distinct morphological features, i.e. rectangular body inclusions in the cytoplasm of leukemic cells and an atypical clinical course characterized by multiple relapses following chemotherapy plus all-transretinoic acid.
Test_Line_8795 Alternative regimens incorporating intermediate doses of cytarabine (1.5-2 g/m2) may also be reasonable in this group.
Test_Line_8796 Treatments are based on the risk profile of individual patients.
Test_Line_8797 There was less reproducibility between laboratories in the lower ranges, presumably because of greater variance of the method in the low range.
Test_Line_8798 In general, our data support the idea that activating mutations of oncogenes are relatively infrequent in myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_8799 During the past 3 to 5 years, "normal" cytogenetics have been shown to encompass several molecular lesions with divergent risk behaviors.
Test_Line_8800 Notably, however, in patients with CBF AML who were treated with postremission therapy with high-dose cytarabine, the presence of c-KIT mutations resulted in poorer outcomes.
Test_Line_8801 Coagulopathy is fairly common at presentation in many leukemias; it is therefore standard clinical practice to screen for coagulopathy by evaluating prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and fibrinogen as part of the initial workup and before performing any invasive procedure.
Test_Line_8802 Older adults with intact functional status (ie, ECOG score 0-2), minimal comorbidity, and favorable cytogenetic or molecular mutations, may benefit from standard therapies regardless of chronologic age.
Test_Line_8803 By contrast, PRC1 is more appropriately thought of as a collection of different complexes on the basis of genomic duplication of the core PRC1 complex between D. melanogaster and mammalian evolutionary development.
Test_Line_8804 Patient number 5677 (P5, II, 1) presented with WHIM-like syndrome with HPV-induced warts, clinical features of extended sarcoidosis, neutropenia, lymphopenia, monocytopenia, and a severe defect in NK cells.
Test_Line_8805 Thus, the cohesin-complex is an essential structure during cell division.
Test_Line_8806 Median survival is listed for specific mutations present in at least 4 of the 439 samples (1%). A patient could have multiple mutations. The P values are for median survival in the group of patients with a mutated gene versus the group of patients without a mutation in that gene. CI denotes confidence interval.
Test_Line_8807 This suggests that DNMT3A mutations may be an early event of clonal evolution.
Test_Line_8808 Karyotype.
Test_Line_8809 For instance, SF3B1 mutations may affect splicing of transcripts coding for proteins associated with iron handling in erythroid precursors, leading to RS.
Test_Line_8810 In this study, we analyzed a large cohort of patients with CMML to define the prevalence and types of RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_8811 In sum, most of the available results suggest that SF3B1 mutations convey better survival in the cohort of whole myeloid malignancies, including RARS and RCMD-RS.
Test_Line_8812 Histograms of log2 expression values were then used to identify cutoffs that defined low expression of STAG2, RAD21, and SMC3 as compared with the cohort of healthy donors.
Test_Line_8813 In a post hoc analysis of subgroups, mean changes in spleen volume among patients with the JAK2V617F mutation were -34.6% in the ruxolitinib group and 8.1% in the placebo group; the corresponding changes among patients without the mutation were -23.8% and 8.4% (P value for interaction, 0.07).
Test_Line_8814 The recent identification of mutations in genes involved in epigenetic regulation has elucidated novel mechanisms of transformation.
Test_Line_8815 The CEBPA gene encodes for CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), a transcription factor that plays a key role in the differentiation of granulocytes.
Test_Line_8816 His younger brother (patient number 6331; P4, III, 2) presented recurrent otitis during infancy and had a long period of extensive warts since the age of 12.
Test_Line_8817 These data suggest the possibility that loss-of-function cohesin mutations alter transcriptional orchestration of differentiation/proliferation and may have a role in clonal evolution and tumorigenesis.
Test_Line_8818 For the moment, no prognostic information is available concerning BCORL1 mutations and this needs to be clarified.
Test_Line_8819 SAMPLES FROM STUDY PATIENTS.
Test_Line_8820 For the purposes of comparison, results were grouped as high (>50%), moderate (5% to 50%), low (2% to 5%), and negative (<2%).
Test_Line_8821 The authors also noted that a survival benefit was not observed in the subgroup of patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT in first CR because of an increased incidence of nonrelapse mortality.
Test_Line_8822 Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that are crucial for regulating cell differentiation and maintaining cell identity in different cellular contexts.
Test_Line_8823 We did not find the patterns of mutations, that is, missense or nonsense/frameshift, to have any influence on clinical outcome.
Test_Line_8824 Cytogenetics and Risk Stratification: Although cytogenetic information is often unknown when treatment is initiated in patients with de novo AML, karyotype represents the single most important prognostic factor for predicting remission rate, relapse risks, and overall survival (OS) outcomes.
Test_Line_8825 Interestingly, all mutations were mutually exclusive among each other.
Test_Line_8826 In the high-risk group, a donor search should begin while the patient is recovering from induction chemotherapy rather than waiting for remission to be achieved.
Test_Line_8827 In contrast, genetic susceptibility to MDS and/or AML is infrequent.
Test_Line_8828 The dose was adjusted for lack of efficacy or excess toxicity as specified in the protocol (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8829 However, many of these mutations in MDS are observed to some extent in other myeloid neoplasms, including AML and other myelproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), indicating the presence of common mechanisms among different myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_8830 DNMT3A mutations are enriched in patients with cytogenetically defined intermediate-risk AML and in patients with class M4 or M5 AML (as defined by the French-American-British (FAB) classification system).
Test_Line_8831 It should also be noted that future trials might involve treatments conceived for specific genetic subgroups.
Test_Line_8832 In contrast to earlier studies, our result, which included the largest cohort of CMML patients who had no earlier history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, showed for the first time a very high frequency of RUNX1 mutations, which was comparable with those reported in atomic bomb survivors or in chemotherapy-related MDS.
Test_Line_8833 Neither of these genetic mutations is available for testing outside of the research setting.
Test_Line_8834 A number of conclusions can be reached, taking these data together.
Test_Line_8835 Screening The usual indications for JAK2 mutation testing include unexplained polycythemia, neutrophilia, or thrombocytosis (when secondary causes have been ruled out), because each may represent a MPN (Table 3).
Test_Line_8836 This is based on the higher prevalence of unfavorable cytogenetics and antecedent myelodysplasia, along with a higher incidence of multidrug resistance in patients older than 60 years, and an increased frequency of comorbid medical conditions that affect the patient's ability to tolerate intensive treatment.
Test_Line_8837 Patients with any cohesin complex mutation had lower BAALC expression levels.
Test_Line_8838 KEY POINTS.
Test_Line_8839 Although there is substantial interest in these technologies, nonetheless there are limitations, especially regarding sensitivity.
Test_Line_8840 All final reports must address preanalytic, analytic, and postanalytic components.
Test_Line_8841 CSF3R mutations.
Test_Line_8842 The authors concluded that the prognostic relevance of DNMT3A mutations may depend on age and mutation type.
Test_Line_8843 Exome sequencing.
Test_Line_8844 About one-third of AML patients harbor well-defined chromosomal translocations and are included as a distinct entity named "AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities" in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_8845 Activating mutations of FLT3 and RAS genes are of class I, whereas RUNX1 mutation is of class II.
Test_Line_8846 Swapna Thota; Aaron D. Viny; Hideki Makishima; Barbara Spitzer; Tomas Radivoyevitch; Bartlomiej Przychodzen; Mikkael A. Sekeres; Ross L. Levine; Jaroslaw P. Maciejewski.
Test_Line_8847 Discovery of frequent mutations of splicing machinery in myelodysplasia.
Test_Line_8848 Christiansen et al. observed that RUNX1 mutations in chemotherapyrelated MDS were associated with a shorter time to AML transformation, and missense mutations had a shorter survival than those with frameshift or nonsense patterns.
Test_Line_8849 Enrico Tiacci; Vera Grossmann; Maria Paola Martelli; Alexander Kohlmann; Torsten Haferlach; and Brunangelo Falini.
Test_Line_8850 Studies are now needed to specifically compare triple-negative PMF with the myelodysplastic syndrome associated with bone marrow fibrosis, but a nonnegligible overlap between the 2 conditions is predictable.
Test_Line_8851 We found that several of these genetic lesions correlate strongly with features of the clinical phenotype, including specific cytopenias, blast percentage, cytogenetic abnormalities, and overall survival.
Test_Line_8852 The use of MPL analysis is best considered after pathology review of a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate.
Test_Line_8853 This technique can reliably detect mutations present at a frequency of 10% or higher.
Test_Line_8854 PcG proteins operate in at least two distinct complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, with a third PcG complex identified in Drosophila melanogaster (the pleiohomeotic repressive complex).
Test_Line_8855 In contrast, CSF3R membrane proximal mutations strongly activate the JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway and are sensitive to JAK kinase inhibitors such as ruxolitinib.
Test_Line_8856 In the subgroup of these patients with AML, a significant survival benefit was found with 5-azacytidine compared with conventional care regimens, with a median OS of 24.5 versus 16 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% CI, 0.28-0.79; P = .005).
Test_Line_8857 More recently, cohesin has been found to localize at superenhancers, which are locus-control regions with broad peaks of H3K27 acetylation.
Test_Line_8858 NCCN Categories of Evidence and Consensus Category 1: Based upon high-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate.
Test_Line_8859 Similar conclusions were reached in studies of patients with PV and ET treated with busulfan.
Test_Line_8860 In addition, more recent work by Iwama and colleagues indicates that loss of BMI1 results in a pathological haematopoiesis that mimics many aspects of human PMF.
Test_Line_8861 ET should be suspected in patients who present with a platelet count >=450 x 109/L and when clinical evidence of reactive thrombocytosis is not obvious (Table 2).
Test_Line_8862 In the EORTC/GIMEMA trial comparing outcomes between patients aged 45 or younger in no-donor (patients in CR planned for autologous HSCT) versus donor groups (patients in CR with matched sibling donor planned for allogeneic HSCT) on an intent-to-treat basis, the 4-year DFS rate for the subgroup with good-risk cytogenetics [eg, t(8;21) or inv(16)] was 66% for the no-donor group (n = 73; 63% underwent HSCT) and 62% for the donor group (n = 50; 72% underwent HSCT).
Test_Line_8863 The limited studies to date of IDH-mutant AML cells suggest that IDH2-R172 mutations result in a higher level of 2-HG than IDH1-R132 mutations.
Test_Line_8864 This phosphorylation results in reduced binding of heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha), a chromatin-binding protein that leads to transcriptional silencing (FIG. 3).
Test_Line_8865 JAK2 protein kinase activity is activated by phosphorylation of its kinase domain. Activation of JAK2 induces signal transduction from both type 1 and type 2 cytokine receptors. Constitutive activation of JAK2 by either point mutation or fusion protein causes activation of the JAK/STAT pathway.
Test_Line_8866 Study population and definitions.
Test_Line_8867 When the JAK2 V617F level of a particular patient falls below 1%, however, caution must be exercised, because very low levels of JAK2 V617F mutations (usually <0.1%) have been described in peripheral blood of unaffected individuals.
Test_Line_8868 However, due to the small number cases of our study and AML is a wide diversity disease which may differ in etiology, pathology, and behavior, the potential role of PTEN/MMAC1 in AML or in some subtypes of AML need further investigation.
Test_Line_8869 Initial treatment based on G-CSF and corticosteroids showed a moderate efficacy on neutropenia.
Test_Line_8870 In addition, the WHO classification system allows AML to be diagnosed regardless of the percentage of marrow blasts in patients with abnormal hematopoiesis and characteristic clonal structural cytogenetic abnormalities with t(15;17), t(8;21), and inv(16) or t(16;16).
Test_Line_8871 Besides these somatic mutations in the cohesin complex, in our analysis, we also identified 3 unannotated SNPs (supplemental Table 7).
Test_Line_8872 A sequencing library was prepared for hotspot regions of IDH1 (exon 4), IDH2 (exon 4), NPM1 (exon 11) and the complete coding region of EZH2 (Supplementary Table 1), comprising a total of 22 amplicons with a median size of 336 bp.
Test_Line_8873 Somatic mutations, such as V617F mutation in JH2, disrupt the inhibitory function of the pseudokinase and thus lead to constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity that promotes cytokine hypersensitivity (UniProt, http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/O60674, last accessed November 28, 2012).

Test_Line_8875 Prognostic scores were analyzed as both a fixed and a time-dependent covariate.
Test_Line_8876 Figure 6. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression with annotation by cohesin mutational status and cohesin expression. (A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of TCGA AML patients with annotation of STAG2 low expression and STAG2 mutation. Patients with STAG2 mutations and low STAG2 expression cluster show a unique expression profile and cluster separately from patients with WT STAG2 and high expression. (B) Cohesin complex expression in STAG2 (i), RAD21 (ii), and SMC3 (iii) low expressors. Within each group of cohesin low expressors, the entire cohesin family gene complex has similarly decreased expression.
Test_Line_8877 Instead, a better molecular characterization of MDS on the genomic, epigenetic, and genetic levels probably more objectively diagnoses conditions, determines patients' prognosis and, based on the underlying molecular defects, directs the application of targeted therapies.
Test_Line_8878 Bone marrow from patients with exon 12 mutation often exhibits nonspecific morphology, with isolated erythroid proliferation and absence of prominent megakaryocyte atypia and clustering.
Test_Line_8879 Some cases may still show evidence of both myeloid and lymphoid antigen expression on the leukemic cells.
Test_Line_8880 Notably, germline cohesin mutations in NIBPL, SMC1A, SMC3, and HDAC8 occur in patients with Cornelia deLange syndrome, hallmarked by craniofacial abnormalities and cognitive deficits.
Test_Line_8881 This result is consistent with Gayther's study, Chang's study, and our previous study of TSG101 and FHIT, in which aberrant transcriptions with different deletions were frequently identified. However, PCR amplification of aberrant transcripts caused by pre-mRNA splicing that was less stringent in cancer cells than in normal tissues should be considered.
Test_Line_8882 In some cases these mutations occur in genes with known roles in regulating chromatin and/or methylation states in haematopoietic progenitors, and in other cases genetic and functional studies have elucidated a role for specific mutations in altering epigenetic patterning in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_8883 Use of growth factors may be a confounding factor in the interpretation of pathology results from bone marrow evaluations.
Test_Line_8884 GATA2 mutations in exons 2-6 were searched for by PCR and Sanger sequencing (primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table 1).
Test_Line_8885 The findings of this study clearly indicate that the genetic basis of disease and, more specifically, the driver mutation responsible for clinical phenotype is an independent predictor of clinical course and outcomes, and that accounting for that can improve the risk stratification provided by IPSS.
Test_Line_8886 The largest series of WHO-defined aCML consists of 55 cases from an Italian cohort.
Test_Line_8887 Pathway mutations involving the RNA splicing machinery.
Test_Line_8888 Laboratory tests for these mutations have become standard in assessing clinically suspected BCR-ABL1-negative MPN.
Test_Line_8889 Of 5 STAG2 and SMC3 mutated patients, 3 carried a mutation in NPM1, respectively.
Test_Line_8890 Splice site mutations can cause activation of a nearby cryptic splice site (upstream or downstream of the normal site), omission of the whole exon, or intron retention, any of which can lead to frameshifts and premature stop codons that will trigger nonsense-mediated decay and haploinsufficiency.
Test_Line_8891 We failed to find a survival difference between CMML patients with RUNX1 mutations and those without RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_8892 However, we found several specific genes in which the splicing pattern was altered.
Test_Line_8893 Sanger sequencing of 310 patients was performed to assess phenotype/genotype associations.
Test_Line_8894 These candidate alterations were subtracted by the results of CD3+ peripheral blood DNA and subsequently validated with Sanger sequencing (see "Sanger sequencing analysis").
Test_Line_8895 These findings may also lend more specificity to the WHO diagnostic criteria for CNL and aCML, which are variably applied in routine clinical practice.
Test_Line_8896 Two of the nine affected patients concomitantly harbored two different EZH2 mutations, however, these were located on two separate amplicons not allowing to discriminate between a monoor biallelic state.
Test_Line_8897 In the latest versions of these guidelines, the panel has endeavored to incorporate emerging data on the influence of mutations in specific genes such as c-KIT, FLT3, CEBPA, and NPM1 on subsets of patients within a cytogenetic category (see "Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities," on page 995).
Test_Line_8898 This result is different from Sakai's study of lymphoid neoplasms, in which the abnormalities of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene may contribute to pathogenesis in a small percentage of malignant lymphoma.
Test_Line_8899 In a multivariable analysis that included clinical features and other mutations, mutations in five genes - TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1 - were independently associated with decreased overall survival.
Test_Line_8900 Extramedullary presentation, including central nervous system (CNS) disease, is uncommon in patients with AML.
Test_Line_8901 One patient (patient number 6183) presented with an urethral malposition that was corrected at the age of 2, and 1 patient (patient number 6225) presented with a thigh fibroma at the age of 3.
Test_Line_8902 Studies that compared hydroxyurea with anagrelide and with pipobroman also showed no difference in leukemogenic potential between these drugs.
Test_Line_8903 Given the role of cohesin in alignment of sister chromatids during cellular replication, cohesin mutations could theoretically lead to chromosomal instability.
Test_Line_8904 EZH2 is an H3K27 methyltransferase.
Test_Line_8905 Figure 1. Schematic illustration of RUNX1b mutations in 30 patients with CMML. CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.
Test_Line_8906 All of the deletions in aberrant transcripts involved exon 5 that contains the PTPase core motif.
Test_Line_8907 The mutation W515L represents guanosine-to-thymidine substitution in MPL at nucleotide 1544, which leads to exchange of leucine for tryptophan.
Test_Line_8908 The presence of reactive marrow fibrosis does not exclude a diagnosis of primary myelofribrosis in the presence of numerous other criteria.
Test_Line_8909 Current treatments for BCR-ABL1-negative MPN are considered noncurative and focus primarily on reducing the risk of complications.
Test_Line_8910 In low-risk MDS, mutations of any 1 of these 3 genes were found in 39% of patients, and further analysis found that mutations in SF3B1 were highly associated with RARS.
Test_Line_8911 TABLE I. Oligonucleotide Primers for Studying the PTEN/MMAC1 Gene.
Test_Line_8912 Initially, we performed whole exome sequencing of 15 index cases with various forms of myeloid malignancies and identified distinct somatic mutations in genes encoding components of the spliceosomal machinery (supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Test_Line_8913 Although the remission rates are similar for high- and standard-dose cytarabine, 2 studies have shown more rapid marrow blast clearance after 1 cycle of high-dose therapy and a DFS advantage for patients aged 50 years or younger who received the high-dose therapy.
Test_Line_8914 These methods easily achieve analytical sensitivities of 1% mutant alleles.
Test_Line_8915 The FAB classification (1976) had set the threshold between high-grade MDS and AML at 30% blasts, whereas the WHO classification lowered the threshold for diagnosing AML to 20% or more blasts; this was based on the finding that the biologic behavior (and survival outcomes) of the FAB MDS subgroup of "refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-T)" with 20% to 30% blasts was equally grim compared with that of patients with greater than 30% blasts.
Test_Line_8916 CALR-mutant ET and CALR-mutant PMF have a relatively indolent clinical course compared with the respective JAK2-mutant disorders.
Test_Line_8917 Five were confirmed by classic Sanger sequencing: EPHB6 T483P, GATA2 R396Q, IMPG2 P1161L, NEK11 D87Y, and TTN P4737R (primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article).
Test_Line_8918 There was no difference in overall survival between patients with and without RUNX1 mutations, but a trend of higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression was observed in mutation-positive patients (16/30 vs 17/51, P = 0.102), especially in patients with C-terminal mutations (P = 0.023).
Test_Line_8919 Association of cohesin gene mutations with clinical characteristics.
Test_Line_8920 Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted from frozen BM mononuclear cells as described earlier.
Test_Line_8921 A 'two-hit' model of leukemogenesis of AML, that is, cooperation of class I mutations that drive proliferation and class II mutations that lead to differentiation block in leukemic cells, has been proposed.
Test_Line_8922 The need for a cardiac evaluation should be determined by individual risk factors, such as patient and family history or previous malignancy treated with cardiotoxic drugs or thoracic radiation.
Test_Line_8923 The approach to validation differs between qualitative and quantitative assays.
Test_Line_8924 These data suggest that therapeutic targeting of the EGLN family may also demonstrate efficacy in the treatment of IDH-mutant disease.
Test_Line_8925 Similarly, overall survival was significantly worse for CMML patients with SETBP1 mutations.
Test_Line_8926 Similarly, for patients younger than 50 years who received high-dose cytarabine at the 3-g/m2 dose schedule for consolidation, the rates of treatment-related deaths (4% vs. 0%) and grade 3 or greater neurologic toxicity (16% vs. 0%) were higher than for those who received the standard dose.
Test_Line_8927 The United Kingdom National Cancer Research Institute AML 14 trial randomized 217 older patients (primarily age > 60 years; de novo AML, n = 129; secondary AML, n = 58; high-risk MDS, n = 30) unfit for chemotherapy to receive either low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously (20 mg twice daily for 10 consecutive days, every 4-6 weeks) or hydroxyurea (given to maintain target WBC counts < 10,000/mcL).
Test_Line_8928 This analysis indicates that evaluation of the mutation status of TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1 would add the most information to clinical prognostic scores as currently assessed in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_8929 The clinical evolution in MDS or AML of patients with germline GATA2 mutations is frequently associated with a partial or complete deletion of chromosome 7: 6 of 11 patients in our study (2 with the R330X mutation, 1 with the A372T mutation, 2 with the R396Q mutation, and 1 with deletion of GATA2 locus), 4 of 10 patients in Kazenwadel et al (T354M, 2 distinct large deletions of GATA2 locus and a frameshift starting from L332), 6 of 28 patients in Hahn et al (T354M or deletion of T355), and the case described by Bodor et al (T354M), suggesting that the monosomy 7q is a recurrent secondary event linked to the overt transformation.
Test_Line_8930 The rate of evolution of patients with severe congenital neutropenia is 10.8% at 20 years increasing to 18.8% in patients with SBDS mutations.
Test_Line_8931 Secondary end points included the duration of the reduction in spleen volume; the proportion of patients with a reduction in the total symptom score of 50% or more from baseline to week 24, as assessed with the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form (MFSAF), version 2.0 (see the Supplementary Appendix); the change in the total symptom score from baseline to week 24; and overall survival.
Test_Line_8932 Concluding remarks.
Test_Line_8933 Clinical parameters studied included age, sex, overall survival (OS), blood counts, and metaphase cytogenetics.
Test_Line_8934 Studies have shown that c-KIT mutations are associated with decreased remission duration (eg, EFS and relapse-free survival) and decreased OS in both groups of patients with t(8;21) or inv(16).
Test_Line_8935 Similarly, nearly one third of patients with RARS-T were found to have a JAK2 mutation.
Test_Line_8936 Case series and analysis of registry data have reported encouraging results, with 40% to 60% 2-year OS rates and 20% nonrelapse mortality for patients who underwent transplant in remission.
Test_Line_8937 Although the ATRA-insensitive PLZF-RARalpha oncoprotein also interacts with the PRC2 complex, PLZF-RARalpha also interacts with PRC1 via its direct association with BMI1 (REF. 98).
Test_Line_8938 However, the lower repopulation of mutant-transduced stem cells raises a serious difficulty to our understanding of how U2AF35 mutated cells achieve clonal dominance over the remaining normal hematopoietic cells, although some oncogenes, such as oncogenic RAS, have been shown to induce apoptosis rather than transformation and promotion of cell growth depending on cell contexts.
Test_Line_8939 The definition of complete remission (CR), overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) followed recommended criteria.
Test_Line_8940 We also performed serial analyses for 12 cases with STAG2 and SMC3 mutations and 1 case with a mutation of RAD21 (Figure 4C-D).
Test_Line_8941 The DNMT3A mutations have been reported in 18% to 22% of patients with AML, with a frequency of 29% to 34% in those with NK-AML.
Test_Line_8942 The latter has been shown to reduce the incidence of life-threatening pancytopenia.
Test_Line_8943 The structures of BCOR and BCORL1 are shown in Figure 1 and their main features are summarized in Table 1.
Test_Line_8944 Myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and impaired differentiation, leading to peripheral-blood cytopenias, but the contribution of specific genotypes to particular cytopenias is unknown.
Test_Line_8945 Furthermore, analysis of the mutant-allele burden in samples with mutations of TET2 and other genes showed that TET2 mutations are not always present at the greatest frequency, which would be expected if they were exclusively involved in early pathogenic events (Fig. 7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8946 Five laboratories also offered JAK2 exon 12 assays, two laboratories offered MPL mutation assays, and another two provided MPL mutation results (although their assays were still being validated).
Test_Line_8947 We identified 7 different GATA2 mutations in 14 patients coming from 7 pedigrees (Figure 1).
Test_Line_8948 Thirty-two RUNX1 mutations were detected in 30 patients (37%); 23 mutants were located in the N-terminal part and 9 in the C-terminal region.
Test_Line_8949 It may also be possible to estimate mutant burden based on the allele frequency calculated from next-generation sequencing data; however, there has been only limited validation of the ability of next-generation sequencing to make this type of estimation.
Test_Line_8950 OVERVIEW.
Test_Line_8951 Two patients had transformation to acute myeloid leukemia; both were in the ruxolitinib group.
Test_Line_8952 Somatic mutations may influence the clinical phenotype but are not included in current prognostic scoring systems.
Test_Line_8953 Moreover, ASXL1 directly interacts with the PRC2 complex in reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments.
Test_Line_8954 These findings also highlight the cost and the huge amount of time involved to investigate the functional and clinical aspects of genetic lesions that occur at a relatively low frequency in AML.
Test_Line_8955 Mutations in DNMT3A have been shown to confer adverse overall survival in patients with cytogenetically defined intermediate-risk AML, and mutations in TET2 confer adverse overall survival in this risk-subset of AML regardless of FLT3 mutational status.
Test_Line_8956 Mutations in the cohesin complex are novel, genetic lesions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that are not well characterized.
Test_Line_8957 RUNX1 and CEBPA, 2 oncogenes encoding transcription factors, have been linked to familial AML and MDS.
Test_Line_8958 We observed that mutations of RUNX1, TP53, and NRAS were each strongly associated with severe thrombocytopenia (P<0.001 for each gene) (Fig. 3A).
Test_Line_8959 The value of cellular markers as a complement to histologic classification was first validated in CML with the discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome and the characterization of the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 fusion protein.
Test_Line_8960 Although this study was designed for evaluation of treatment in patients with high-risk MDS (based on FAB criteria), 113 study patients (32%) fulfilled criteria for AML using the 2008 WHO classification, with marrow-blast percentage between 20% and 30%.
Test_Line_8961 To examine the clinical effects of mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, we evaluated all 439 samples for all the genes identified above, as well as a set of 13 genes previously reported to be mutated in hematologic cancers.
Test_Line_8962 Individual reads were 75 bp long.

Test_Line_8965 JAK2V617F is the best characterized mutation in BCR-ABL1-negative MPN.
Test_Line_8966 Biomarkers.
Test_Line_8967 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Test_Line_8968 Progression to blast phase according to JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status.
Test_Line_8969 When presented with rare cases such as acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (including mixed phenotype acute leukemias, as defined by the 2008 WHO classification), consultation with an experienced hematopathologist should be sought.
Test_Line_8970 The BCOR protein acts as corepressor of BCL6, it can bind to other transcriptional factors and appears to play a key role in the regulation of early embryonic development, mesenchymal stem cell function and hematopiesis.
Test_Line_8971 Of the 617 PMF patients, the clinical-molecular risk was very low in 71 patients, low in 150 patients, intermediate in 202 patients, high in 141 patients, and very high in 53 patients.
Test_Line_8972 Mutational frequencies of ASXL1 are listed as reported in the original referenced manuscripts (this may include the controversial ASXL1 pGly646fsX12 variant (REF. 83)).
Test_Line_8973 Severe infections were defined as those that would be life-threatening without appropriate antibiotic or antifungal therapy.
Test_Line_8974 In all, 27 of these 79 cases (34.2%) harbored a mutation in ASXL1, not including 14 cases that harbored the putative c.1934dupG germline variant.
Test_Line_8975 In AML, SETBP1 overexpression is significantly associated with reduced survival, indicating that SETBP1 may be relevant to leukemia oncogenesis.
Test_Line_8976 Importantly, clinical outcomes in patients with therapy-related AML have been shown to be significantly inferior (both in terms of relapse-free and overall survivals) compared with patients with de novo cases, except those with the therapy-related acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtype or the favorable-risk core binding factor (CBF) translocations.
Test_Line_8977 By contrast, mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 seem to be significantly associated with mutations in NPM1, and NPM1-IDH1 or NPM1-IDH2 co-mutant patients comprise a subset of intermediate-risk AML with remarkably favourable clinical outcome.
Test_Line_8978 Efficacy.
Test_Line_8979 Similarly, patients 60 years or older who are physically fit and wish to pursue treatment after relapse may be offered the following options: 1) therapy on clinical trial (strongly preferred option by the panel); or 2) salvage chemotherapy followed by matched sibling or alternate donor HSCT (again, transplant should be considered only if the patient has entered remission or in the context of a clinical trial); or 3) retreatment with the initial successful induction for a patients with a long initial remission duration (ie, relapse > 12 months).
Test_Line_8980 CR/complete response with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) was achieved in 46% of patients, with a 30day mortality rate of 10%.
Test_Line_8981 These drugs are expected to be more effective in the chronic phase of disease before increasing genetic complexity associated with disease transformation supervenes, and therapeutic inhibition of CSF3R-related signaling may be less relevant.
Test_Line_8982 At several points during the course of treatment, response is assessed based on bone marrow morphology and cytogenetic and molecular responses (see pages 997 and 998 for definitions of complete and partial response and disease relapse).
Test_Line_8983 The only potentially curative therapy is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, but treatment-related mortality remains high.
Test_Line_8984 Clinical suspicion of PMF may be raised in the context of nonspecific derangements in PB counts and evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis (ie, palpable splenomegaly).
Test_Line_8985 These complexes serve an important function that is conserved throughout vertebrate development, in which PcG protein complexes initiate and maintain transcriptional silencing through specific post-translational histone modifications.
Test_Line_8986 Research has primarily focused on the prognostic implication of cytogenetics in BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs.
Test_Line_8987 Only 17% of patients were assigned to an IPSS risk group that differed from the group assigned at the time of diagnosis.
Test_Line_8988 However, if symptoms persist, and bleeding and mass/lesions are excluded, the patient should have a lumbar puncture (LP) for diagnostic and possible therapeutic purposes once coagulopathy has been corrected and adequate platelet support is available.
Test_Line_8989 We suggest, therefore, that EZH2 mutational status should be taken into account in future clinical studies of CMML.
Test_Line_8990 According to the response criteria of the International Working Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment, 41.2% of patients in the ruxolitinib group and 46.9% of patients in the placebo group who were dependent on transfusions at baseline were classified as transfusion-independent during the study (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_8991 The PCR was performed on a DNA thermal cycler using a program consisting of 35 cycles at 95--degrees--C for 30 s, 58--degrees--C for 30 s and 68--degrees--C for 1 min, with an initial preheating at 94--degrees--C for 3 min and a final step for 5 min at 68--degrees--C.

Test_Line_8993 Management of AML in Patients Older Than 60 Years.
Test_Line_8994 As reported by Ernst et al EZH2 mutations were identified in 13% of CMML patients and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm patients mutated in EZH2 had been associated with an inferior outcome (P = 0.0006).
Test_Line_8995 For example, SF3B1 was shown to participate in Hox gene regulation through functional interaction with polycomb and trithorax genes.
Test_Line_8996 Table 4. Methods in Detecting JAK2 Mutations.
Test_Line_8997 Other options for this group include clinical trials or multiple courses (3-4) of high-dose cytarabine consolidation.
Test_Line_8998 In all patients except those at highest risk, the presence of these mutations is associated with an overall survival similar to that of patients in the next-highest IPSS risk group.
Test_Line_8999 ASSOCIATIONS FROM THE MULTIVARIABLE SURVIVAL MODEL.
Test_Line_9000 Overall, MPL W515L or W515K mutations are present in patients with PMF and ET at a frequency of approximately 5% and 3%, respectively.
Test_Line_9001 Minor infections were defined as those for which patients did not seek medical attention (eg, stomatologic, ear, nose, and throat infections).
Test_Line_9002 Table 1. Biologic and clinical presentations of patients with GATA2 mutations.
Test_Line_9003 Low-risk patients with platelet counts >1000 x 109/L are considered separately (Table 4).
Test_Line_9004 ASXL1 belongs to the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb gene family and is mutated in 33% of CMML.
Test_Line_9005 Similarly, U2AF26 mutations resulted in an alteration of RUNX1 splicing (supplemental Figure 7).
Test_Line_9006 In the subgroup of patients with CN-AML (n = 201), we identified 16 patients with mutations in the cohesin complex (8%).
Test_Line_9007 Notably, these salvage treatment options are aggressive regimens intended for appropriate patients who can tolerate such therapies; for other patents, less aggressive treatment options may include low-dose cytarabine or hypomethylating agents.
Test_Line_9008 He underwent HSCT with a matched unrelated donor in April 2012.
Test_Line_9009 Patient no. 8 had Pro398Leu, which is within the inhibitory domain (aa372-411) found to keep the full transactivating potential of RUNX1.
Test_Line_9010 Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation and subdivided according to their IPSS risk. Vertical tick marks indicate right-censored patients. (A) "Lower" IPSS risk subgroup, including patients with low or intermediate-1 IPSS risk: CALR-mutant patients had longer survival compared with either JAK2 (V617F)-mutant (P = .011) or triple-negative patients (P = .001). (B) "Higher risk" subgroup, including patients with intermediate-2 or high IPSS risk: CALR-mutant patients had longer survival compared with the remaining genetic subgroups (maximum P value equal to .023).
Test_Line_9011 The integrity and purity of total RNA were assessed with Agilent Bioanalyzer. cDNA (1-2 mug) was generated with Clontech SmartPCR cDNA kit (Clontech Laboratories) from 100 ng of total RNA.
Test_Line_9012 MPL mutation analysis is not indicated in the consideration of PV, because no MPL mutations have been described for this entity.
Test_Line_9013 Therefore, the importance of obtaining adequate samples of marrow or peripheral blood at diagnosis for full karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetic analysis for the most common abnormalities cannot be overemphasized.
Test_Line_9014 First, overall JAK2 V617F mutation testing was reproducible among the laboratories performing this testing.
Test_Line_9015 To evaluate the role of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene in leukemia, bone marrow and/or peripheral blood from 62 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 5 hemopoietic cell lines (HL60, U937, Raji, KG-1, K562), and 30 normal controls were analyzed.
Test_Line_9016 In addition, an increase in immature thymic T cells and mature splenic B cells was observed in at least one Tet2-knockout mouse model, consistent with effects on lymphoid fate commitment.
Test_Line_9017 Cohesin complex mutations were almost always mutually exclusive (Figure 2A).
Test_Line_9018 Sequencing analysis of the aberrant fragments of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene revealed the existence of eight types of RT-PCR products with losses of various exons of the published PTEN/MMAC1 sequence from exons 1-9 (Fig. 2).
Test_Line_9019 Cytogenetic analysis was performed according to standard banding techniques on the basis of 20 metaphases.
Test_Line_9020 Mutations are numbered as recommended by the Human Genome Variation Society (http://www.hgvs.org/) using the reference sequence NM_032638.4.
Test_Line_9021 As shown in Figure 1 and Table 1, seven patients had eight missense mutations at RHD and one patient had a missense mutation at the C-terminal region, all resulting in single amino-acid substitutions.
Test_Line_9022 Events that occurred more frequently in the ruxolitinib group were ecchymosis, dizziness, and headache (predominantly grade 1 or 2) (Table 2).
Test_Line_9023 Furthermore, activated Ras signaling may alter the expression of key identity genes, which are then further dysregulated by cohesin inactivity.
Test_Line_9024 Table 2. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis of driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, and MPL) and IPSS variables evaluated as risk factors for survival in patients with PMF.
Test_Line_9025 The majority of the ZRSR2 mutated cases were male, in which single mutations resulted in complete loss of functions.
Test_Line_9026 Moreover, screening of whole exome sequencing results for AML available through the Cancer Genome Atlas showed the presence of mutations in genes encoding other components of the spliceosome, including mutations in HCFC1 (P72L), SAP130 (T247I), SRSF6 (W123S), SON (M1024V), and U2AF26 (C116X; supplemental Figure 1).
Test_Line_9027 The HR was 1.83 (95% CI, 1.69-1.99, P <.001), that is, there was a 1.83-fold increase in hazard for a 1-point increase in the sum of weights.
Test_Line_9028 Seventy-four of 617 patients (12%) progressed to blast phase (leukemic transformation), including 43 of 399 subjects (11%) with JAK2 mutation, 17 of 140 (12%) with CALR mutation, 3 of 25 (12%) with MPL mutation, and 11 of 53 triple-negative subjects (21%).
Test_Line_9029 Trithorax.
Test_Line_9030 Additional MPL mutations have since been described at the same locus, with an overall MPL515 mutational frequency estimated at 4% for ET and 11% for PMF.
Test_Line_9031 Traditional therapeutic options, including splenectomy, have limited benefit.
Test_Line_9032 At 20 years of age, he underwent HSCT with an unrelated donor.
Test_Line_9033 The major chromosome aberrations in leukemia are specific translocations juxtaposing genes that activate oncogenes or create novel fusion genes.
Test_Line_9034 She had 3 children, 1 of whom developed MDS detected in the evaluation of asthenia at the age of 12 (patient number 5834; P3, III, 3).
Test_Line_9035 Most laboratories reported their results as a JAK2 V617 percentage of unmutated alleles.
Test_Line_9036 The 2 most frequent molecular lesions with prognostic impact in patients with AML are mutations of the FLT3 gene (37%-46% of patients) encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in hematopoiesis, and mutations of the NPM1 gene (28%-35%) encoding a shuttling protein within the nucleolus.
Test_Line_9037 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_9038 Similarly, 15 out of 20 RAD21 sequence alterations were nonsense (n = 2), frameshift (n = 11), or splice site (n = 2) mutations causing low expression of the gene; 5 were missense mutations.
Test_Line_9039 No difference was seen in relapse rate, EFS, or OS outcomes between the treatment arms.
Test_Line_9040 Patient-specific barcodes and sequencing primers P1 and P2 were ligated to these fragments.
Test_Line_9041 Cytogenetics.
Test_Line_9042 Current genetic and functional data suggest that mutations in epigenetic modifiers fall into at least two novel classes: one set of mutations that affect DNA hydroxymethylation (including TET2, IDH1 and IDH2), and a second set that directly regulate DNA methylation and/or the histone state (including MLL, ASXL1 and DNMT3A).
Test_Line_9043 After excluding all known single-nucleotide polymorphisms and filtering out alterations present in paired germline samples, somatic alterations in cohesin complex genes were identified in 11.6% of patients, including STAG2 (5.9%), RAD21 (2%), and SMC3 (2%).
Test_Line_9044 JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation analysis.
Test_Line_9045 However, the genomic landscape of PMF has changed considerably since then.
Test_Line_9046 There is increasing interest in INF-alpha due to its nonleukemogenic potential; however, the risk of leukemic transformation with hydroxyurea and busulfan therapies has likely been overstated.
Test_Line_9047 The median age at the last follow-up was 18 years (range, 7-56).
Test_Line_9048 The methodology summary of sequencing assays should clearly state the regions covered by the assay.
Test_Line_9049 Mutations in PRC2 components do not seem to be mutually exclusive.
Test_Line_9050 All of these parameters were available for 780 patients in this cohort after excluding 200 pAML TCGA cases and 80 patients with incomplete clinical details.
Test_Line_9051 All factors of Table 2 were therefore included in the new prognostic model, here defined as clinical-molecular prognostic model.
Test_Line_9052 At least 18 clones were subsequently sequenced.
Test_Line_9053 Therapy has primarily consisted of hydroxyurea or other oral chemotherapeutics, as well as interferon-a.
Test_Line_9054 The frequency of chromosomal changes in aCML is more variable, ranging from 20% to 88% in 4 series.
Test_Line_9055 In another study, IDH mutations (IDH1 and IDH2 combined) were associated with significantly inferior 5-year relapse-free survival rates (37% vs. 67%; P = .02) and OS rates (41% vs. 65%; P = .03) in the subgroup of patients with favorable-risk AML (normal karyotype with NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD).
Test_Line_9056 Older adults with newly diagnosed AML with ECOG performance status score of 0 to 2, with or without adverse features (such as therapy-related AML/prior MDS or unfavorable cytogenic or molecular markers) may be managed with one of the following options: clinical trial, standard infusional cytarabine and anthracycline; low-intensity therapy (eg, subcutaneous cytarabine, azacitidine, or decitabine); or intermediate-intensity therapy with clofarabine (category 2B).
Test_Line_9057 The most common CSF3R mutation in CNL/aCML is the membrane proximal mutation: T618I.
Test_Line_9058 DNA, RNA extraction and cDNA preparation.
Test_Line_9059 Recommendations for induction chemotherapy in patients with AML consider age 60 years as a therapeutic divergence point.
Test_Line_9060 TET2 mutations occur in 10-20% of cases of MPN and MDS and in 7-23% of cases of AML (TABLE 1).
Test_Line_9061 Moreover, FLT3-TKD mutation as the sole genetic aberration or occurring concurrently with t(15;17)/PML-RARA (underlying lesion in the APL subtype) or with FLT3-ITD (FLT3 double mutation) has been associated with poorer outcomes.
Test_Line_9062 The guidelines recommend monitoring complete blood counts, including platelets, every 1 to 3 months for the first 2 years after patients have completed consolidation therapy, then every 3 to 6 months thereafter for a total of 5 years.
Test_Line_9063 In contrast to the irreversible nature of somatic mutations, epigenetic modifications are theoretically alterable and thus a potential target for therapeutic interventions.
Test_Line_9064 These mutations were not strongly associated with clinical features such as cytopenias or blast proportion, findings that are consistent with the observation that TET2 mutations occur in diverse myeloid cancers, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, that are not characterized by defects in hematopoietic differentiation.
Test_Line_9065 A prospective phase II study evaluated the efficacy of reduced intensity conditioning followed by HCT in 103 patients with PMF or post-PV/ET MF.
Test_Line_9066 However, there is a concern that some laboratories may have had a high true false-positive rate, because one laboratory had a positive result that was not detected by any other laboratory.
Test_Line_9067 Consonant with the genetic data showing that mutations in epigenetic modifiers occur in concert with class I and class II mutations, functional studies have revealed that perturbations of these epigenetic modifiers alone can confer self-renewal and lead to myeloid transformation.
Test_Line_9068 CNL may be the archetype of an MPN whose pathogenesis is predominantly characterized by mutations of CSF3R, whereas aCML may be more genetically heterogeneous.
Test_Line_9069 The correlation between cooperating mutations and AML transformation is also shown in Table 1. Only one patient harboring a C-terminal mutation (no. 30) had a cooperating mutation with NRAS (Gly12Asp).
Test_Line_9070 The target genes (in total, 1782 amplicons) were successfully analyzed in all cases.
Test_Line_9071 Mutations in one or more of these genes were present in 137 of the 439 patients (31.2%).
Test_Line_9072 Fourteen unrelated proband cases were selected for the presence of a neutropenia, a WHIM-like syndrome with possible evolution to MDS/AML, and their negativity for mutations of the major genes involved in congenital neutropenia (ELANE, CXCR4, SBDS, and G6PC3).
Test_Line_9073 Ideally, JAK2 analysis for investigating the cause of neutrophilia and thrombocytosis would follow a determination of the absence of the BCR-ABL1 translocation t(9;22).
Test_Line_9074 The risk of hemorrhage secondary to acquired von Willebrand syndrome may preclude the use of aspirin in patients with a ristocetin cofactor activity <30%.
Test_Line_9075 The allele burden may be expressed as a ratio of mutant (mut) to wild-type (wt) alleles, or more commonly, as a percentage of mutated JAK2 alleles, calculated as (JAK2mut)/(JAK2mut + JAK2wt) x100.
Test_Line_9076 The use of aspirin, hydroxyurea, and phlebotomy for PV and ET, and the use of androgens, steroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for PMF continues to be the mainstay of therapy.
Test_Line_9077 There is a dearth of follow-up information for MPL mutation analysis, likely because of the low number of cases identified to date.
Test_Line_9078 Cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities associated with cohesin defects.
Test_Line_9079 Figure 3. Janus kinase signalling affects the epigenome through direct and indirect activities. Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK2 have recently been shown to be able to enter the nucleus and to directly phosphorylate (P) tyrosine 41 of histone H3 (H3Y41). At least one consequence of H3Y41 phosphorylation is displaced binding of the repressive protein heterochromatin protein 1alpha (HP1alpha) from chromatin. The genome-wide effects of H3Y41 phosphorylation and HP1alpha localization in contexts with and without JAK overactivity have yet to be published. Nor is it clear exactly how JAK1 and JAK2 enter the nucleus. In addition to phosphorylating H3Y41, nuclear JAK2 has been shown to phosphorylate protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). This thereby inhibits PRMT5 activity and results in reduced histone H2A and H4 arginine methyltransferase activity. Mutated forms of JAK2, as seen most prominently in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, result in increased kinase activity on the substrate PRMT5. H4R3me2, histone H4 dimethylated on arginine 3.
Test_Line_9080 However, due to the low frequency of the mutation, additional studies are necessary to confirm these findings.
Test_Line_9081 This study showed for the first time a high frequency of RUNX1 mutations in CMML.
Test_Line_9082 One laboratory found a third specimen positive for W515L, but the mutation was not detected in the other two laboratories that tested this specimen.
Test_Line_9083 Current recommendations support the use of aspirin as first-line therapy in all risk classes unless contraindicated.
Test_Line_9084 Within "higher-risk" subjects (Figure 5B), CALR-mutant patients had a better OS compared with all the remaining genetic subgroups (P = .023 compared with JAK2-mutant, P = .003 compared with MPL-mutant, and P = .001 compared with triple-negative patients).
Test_Line_9085 Scores ranged from 0 ("absent" symptoms) to 10 ("worst imaginable" symptoms), and the total symptom score was the sum of the individual scores, excluding inactivity.
Test_Line_9086 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_9087 A large German trial has revealed additional molecular prognostic markers for patients with NK-AML.
Test_Line_9088 A recent retrospective study based on data in older patients (age 50-70 years) with AML compared outcomes in patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT (either myeloablative conditioning or RIC; n = 152) and those who did not receive HSCT in first CR (chemotherapy only; n = 884).
Test_Line_9089 We identified a total of 23 patients (5.9%) with somatic mutations in 1 of the cohesin genes. All gene mutations were mutually exclusive, and STAG1 (1.8%), STAG2 (1.3%), and SMC3 (1.3%) were most frequently mutated.
Test_Line_9090 The most common grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse events (abdominal pain, fatigue, and dyspnea) occurred more frequently in the placebo group.
Test_Line_9091 As illustrated in Figures 4-5, the prognosis of a triple-negative patient is markedly worse than that of a CALR-mutant patient: in these cases, therapeutic decisions may span from a watchful waiting strategy to allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Test_Line_9092 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Test_Line_9093 The effect of the S34F and Q157P/R U2AF35 mutants was also tested in competitive repopulation assays, in which highly purified mouse hematopoietic stem cells (CD34- c-Kit+ ScaI+ Lin-) were transduced with each mutant and together with normal competitors, transplanted into lethally irradiated mice.
Test_Line_9094 The comparison of cumulative incidence curves in different groups of patients was carried out using the Pepe-Mori test, whereas the effect of quantitative covariates was estimated by applying the Fine-Gray regression model.
Test_Line_9095 Our comprehension of the biological consequences of these epigenetic changes is still at a nascent stage.
Test_Line_9096 In 1951, Dameshek organized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) into an inclusive disease category that he termed "myeloproliferative disorders" (MPD).
Test_Line_9097 Although some studies showed no prognostic effect of IDH1 mutations on OS when considering all IDH mutations (IDH1 and IDH2 combined) or in the overall patient population, IDH1 mutations seemed to be associated with significantly worse outcomes in the subgroup of patients with NK-AML with favorable- or intermediate-risk disease.
Test_Line_9098 Additional prespecified analyses showed that among the patients for whom baseline and week 24 data were available, the 139 patients receiving ruxolitinib had a mean reduction in spleen volume of 31.6% (median, 33.0%) at week 24; the 106 patients receiving placebo had a mean increase of 8.1% (median, 8.5%).
Test_Line_9099 Other hematological neoplasms (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia) may harbor JAK2 and MPL mutations in low frequencies.
Test_Line_9100 Allogeneic HCT is also potentially curative in PV and ET, but the already high rates of long-term survival with these diseases preclude the use of aggressive therapy with a high risk of mortality.
Test_Line_9101 The World Health Organization (WHO), first in 2001 and again in 2008, began reclassifying these disorders in light of evolving histologic, cytogenetic, and molecular information.
Test_Line_9102 Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14.0.1 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Test_Line_9103 Yet, due to the limited number of EZH2-mutated cases, we did not separate the cohort into these two categories in subsequent analyses.
Test_Line_9104 Bone marrow proliferation of pleomorphic, loosely clustered megakaryocytes with unique stromal changes and without maturation defects is commonly seen in PV but is not diagnostic.
Test_Line_9105 Test Validation and Proficiency Testing
Test_Line_9106 Subsequent analysis of the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry allowed the identification of 10 additional patients with GATA2 mutations in 6 pedigrees with unexplained mild neutropenia in at least 1 patient of the pedigree.
Test_Line_9107 Thirteen deaths occurred in the ruxolitinib group as compared with 24 deaths in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.98; P = 0.04).
Test_Line_9108 In the present study, we describe the initial identification by exome sequencing of GATA2 mutation in a mother and her 3 children associated with a prior history of chronic mild neutropenia evolving to AML and/or MDS.
Test_Line_9109 Clinical presentations of pedigree 1.
Test_Line_9110 Among the 3 older patients, 2 had presented severe vascular complications, 1 with a lethal aortic dissection at the age of 36 (patient number 7107) and 1 cardiac infarct at the age of 50 in a woman without risk factors (patient number 5593).
Test_Line_9111 The in vitro expression of JAK2V617F results in the constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and resultant cytokine-independent growth.
Test_Line_9112 The remaining mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing.
Test_Line_9113 Figure 4. The contribution of Polycomb-mediated gene repression to the pathophysiology of APL. Fusion of the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene to the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene results in a hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL): the PML-RARA fusion. Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) has been found to directly associate with the PML-RARalpha fusion protein but not to either endogenous protein alone. PRC2-mediated transcriptional repression is thought to have a role in the leukaemogenic activity of PML-RARalpha, and the loss of PRC2 components in mouse models of APL results in the differentiation of APL cells. A variant RARalpha translocation is the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF)- RARalpha fusion, which results in a form of APL that is insensitive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the main therapeutic modality used to treat patients with APL. Interestingly, it has been shown that unlike PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha also interacts with PRC1 via direct association with BMI1 (REF. 98). Treatment with ATRA results in a loss of PRC2 recruitment by PLZF-RARalpha, whereas PRC1-mediated gene repression persists in an ATRA-insensitive manner. This explains, at least in part, the lack of efficacy of ATRA in PLZF-RARalpha-positive APL. CBX4, chromobox protein homologue 4; EED, embryonic ectoderm development; EZH2, enhancer of zeste homologue 2; H2AK119Ub, histone H2A ubiquitylated on lysine 119; H3K27me3, histone H3 trimethylated on lysine 27; PH1, polyhomeotic-like protein 1; SUZ12, suppressor of zeste 12 homologue.
Test_Line_9114 Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) testing for monitoring JAK2 V617F allele burden has been limited to patients enrolled in clinical trials such as the peg-IFN-a-2a and MF-TG101348-001 trials.
Test_Line_9115 Patients carrying a CALR mutation had a lower risk of thrombosis than those carrying JAK2 (V617F) (P = .021), whereas no significant difference was observed by comparing the other genotypic subgroups.
Test_Line_9116 TET2 mutations were not exclusive of abnormalities in other epigenetic regulators such as the chromatin-modifying genes ASXL1 and EZH2.
Test_Line_9117 The limited experience with induction-type chemotherapy for blastic transformation is generally poor with death related to resistant disease or regimen-related toxicities.
Test_Line_9118 Marlene Pasquet; Christine Bellanne-Chantelot; Suzanne Tavitian; Nais Prade; Blandine Beaupain; Olivier LaRochelle; Arnaud Petit; Pierre Rohrlich; Christophe Ferrand; Eric Van Den Neste; Helene A. Poirel; Thierry Lamy; Marie Ouachee-Chardin; Veronique Mansat-De Mas; Jill Corre; Christian Recher; Genevieve Plat; Francoise Bachelerie; Jean Donadieu; Eric Delabesse.
Test_Line_9119 Interestingly, these last two specimens were also found to be positive for JAK2 V617F by many of the participating laboratories.
Test_Line_9120 This allows for broad multigene coverage in a single assay, thereby interrogating all of the targets deemed relevant for a particular clinical entity.
Test_Line_9121 Mutations in TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, and ASXL1 are predictors of poor overall survival in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, independently of established risk factors.
Test_Line_9122 The most prominent examples are from recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies that have identified somatic alterations in genes that encode proteins regulating DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications.
Test_Line_9123 In 2013, somatic mutations of CALR, the gene encoding calreticulin, have been found in 20% to 25% of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or PMF.
Test_Line_9124 However, such significant effects seem less in each background-matched specific disease phenotype by multivariate analysis, including, for example, International Prognostic Scoring System score.
Test_Line_9125 Mutations in the cohesin complex in acute myeloid leukemia: clinical and prognostic implications.
Test_Line_9126 We found a strong association between mutations affecting the cohesin complex and NPM1.
Test_Line_9127 It is possible that the mutations lead to distinct phenotypes by affecting different stages of splicing and/or by causing defective splicing of specific gene transcripts.
Test_Line_9128 Response is then categorized as complete response or induction failure.
Test_Line_9129 At least 27 clinically verified exon 12 mutations have been identified to date, including amino acid substitution, deletions, and duplications (Table 1).
Test_Line_9130 The procedures followed were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000, and samples were obtained after patients had provided written informed consent.
Test_Line_9131 CR rates for patients who are 50 years or younger have consistently been in the 60% to 70% range in most large cooperative group trials of infusional cytarabine and anthracycline.
Test_Line_9132 Abnormalities in seven genes were significantly associated with poor overall survival in univariate analyses (Fig. 2, and Fig. 4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9133 Reads were assigned to their patient-specific barcode, and sequences were analyzed twice separately using the 2010 DNAnexus software and the following pipeline of bioinformatics software.
Test_Line_9134 Whole exome sequencing of 15 patients with myeloid neoplasms was performed, and somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes were identified.
Test_Line_9135 In 2 of these 6 pedigrees (P3 and P4, Figure 1), we identified a GATA2 mutation in 4 affected relatives, 1 in P3 and 3 in P4.
Test_Line_9136 The PCR products were diluted 20-fold, and 1 muL of the diluted product was used for a second round of PCR for 35 cycles using two nested primers, M2u and M2d.
Test_Line_9137 We also observed a subset of AML patients with marked reduction in STAG2 and PDS5B expression in the absence of cohesin mutation.
Test_Line_9138 We did not observe widespread defective splicing, but rather distinct changes in specific introns, as seen in RUNX1, that would functionally have the same effect as RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_9139 Postinduction Therapy : To judge the efficacy of the induction therapy, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed 7 to 10 days after completion of induction therapy.
Test_Line_9140 Background.
Test_Line_9141 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_9142 As our study shows, somatic mutations in several genes are associated with distinct effects on cytopenias, blast proportion, the likelihood of co-occurrence with other molecular lesions, and overall survival.
Test_Line_9143 In a prespecified analysis of biomarkers, patients who received ruxolitinib had mean reductions in the JAK2V617F allele burden of 10.9% at week 24 and 21.5% at week 48; patients who received placebo had a mean increase of 3.5% at week 24 and 6.3% at week 48 (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9144 The rate of therapy-related MDS/AML is higher among patients with certain primary tumors, including breast cancer, gynecologic cancers, and lymphomas (both nonHodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma), largely owing to the more leukemogenic cytotoxic agents that are commonly used in the treatment of these tumors.
Test_Line_9145 Mutations in exon 13, exon 15, and exon 14 other than V617F are exceptionally rare, and are observed in a broader variety of disease types.
Test_Line_9146 Principal causes of death in the placebo group were staphylococcal infection, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intestinal perforation, multiorgan failure, pneumonia, sepsis (in 2 patients), and disease progression (in 4 patients).
Test_Line_9147 The most commonly mutated gene in this complex was STAG1 with 7 patients harboring a mutation in this gene.
Test_Line_9148 We identified a heterozygous GATA2 R204X mutation (c.610C > T, supplemental Figure 1).
Test_Line_9149 We identified somatic mutations in 18 genes, including two, ETV6 and GNAS, that have not been reported to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_9150 The reclassification of MPN by the WHO reflects the increasingly heterogenic character of MPDs.
Test_Line_9151 TET2.
Test_Line_9152 Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML).
Test_Line_9153 By definition, mutations in this class of genes affect global chromatin landscapes and many genes and pathways are altered; thus, simple linear explanations are unlikely to precisely show how these mutations contribute to leukaemia development.
Test_Line_9154 Genomic DNA Preparation.
Test_Line_9155 Other indications for JAK2 mutation analysis include splanchnic vein thrombosis and the provisional entity refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T).
Test_Line_9156 There is a lack of standardization among the variety of qualitative and quantitative methods available to detect the range of molecular alterations in JAK2 and MPL.
Test_Line_9157 An alternative strategy for patients with antecedent myelodysplasia who have not received a hypomethylating agent would be a trial of either decitabine or azacytidine while a rapid donor search is initiated.
Test_Line_9158 All other sequence variants were confirmed to be somatic by sequencing paired flow-sorted CD3+ cells.
Test_Line_9159 The authors compared the results of RIC allogeneic HSCT with those from matched subjects receiving conventional-dose chemotherapy.
Test_Line_9160 For confirmation of the somatic nature of the mutations, exons containing mutations were tested in nonclonal control DNA.
Test_Line_9161 Adverse effects of splenectomy in patients with PMF include bleeding, thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, increased circulating blasts, and hepatomegaly.
Test_Line_9162 Cross-sectional deep-sequencing analysis for clonal hierarchy demonstrated STAG2, SMC3, and RAD21 mutations to be ancestral in 18%, 18%, and 47% of cases, respectively, and each expanded to clonal dominance concordant with disease transformation.
Test_Line_9163 If a quantitative cutoff is used to define a positive result, this value should be stated as part of the methodology summary, and a limit of sensitivity must also be included.
Test_Line_9164 Such nonmutated cohesin low expressors have been described in both AML and Ewing sarcoma cell lines.
Test_Line_9165 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a disease characterized by high molecular heterogeneity.
Test_Line_9166 A mechanism that repairs damaged DNA throughout the cell cycle.
Test_Line_9167 NA, not available in the original publication.
Test_Line_9168 Cohesin mutations did not alter the IPSS cytogenetic risk of MDS patients (the average IPSS cytogenetics score was 0.55 points for cohesin mutant cohort and 0.60 points for WT).
Test_Line_9169 We therefore studied a cohort of 1060 patients with MDS, myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes, and primary and secondary AML (pAML and sAML, respectively) to elucidate the clinical characteristics of patients with myeloid neoplasms harboring cohesin mutations with respect to disease phenotype, genetic background, therapeutic response, and clinical outcome.
Test_Line_9170 However, we had examined a large number of Chinese patients with de novo AML and had found that RUNX1 mutations, except for AML-M0 subtype, were rarely present (data not shown).
Test_Line_9171 All mutations were detected by bidirectional sequencing and scored as pathogenic if not present in nonclonal paired CD3-derived DNA.
Test_Line_9172 A randomized phase III study has shown that in patients with neutropenia undergoing induction chemotherapy for AML or MDS, posaconazole was significantly more effective in preventing invasive fungal infections than fluconazole or itraconazole, and was associated with improved OS outcomes.
Test_Line_9173 As previously observed in ET, JAK2 (V617F) appears to be highly thrombophilic also in patients with PMF, indicating that this mutation likely causes thrombosis through multiple mechanisms, including activation of platelets and granulocytes.
Test_Line_9174 Nevertheless, a simplified prognostic scoring scheme has great clinical value.
Test_Line_9175 She had a large monoallelic deletion of 61 kb (Chr3:128.17-128.23 Mb) completely encompassing GATA2 and 2 other genes, DNAJB8 and LOC90246 (supplemental Figure 1).
Test_Line_9176 These SCN patients harbor germ-line mutations in neutrophil elastase or other genes necessary for production of neutrophils.
Test_Line_9177 Its estimated prevalence is more than 95% in PV, 50% in ET, and 50% in PMF, and its value as a diagnostic marker is improved by a low prevalence in non-MPN myeloproliferative diseases.
Test_Line_9178 In principle, the presence of additional exon 14 mutations can interfere with binding of primers and probes in allele-specific assays, but such mutations are exceptionally rare (<1% of all JAK2 mutations).
Test_Line_9179 Clonal hierarchy analysis rarely identified cohesin mutations in founding clones; rather, cohesins were present in subclones that underwent clonal expansion over time.
Test_Line_9180 Throughout, 2-sided tests were used with significance defined as a <.05.
Test_Line_9181 BCOR mutations were demonstrated to be clonal, somatic, disruptive events involving the only functional allele, not only in male but also in female AML patients.
Test_Line_9182 ASSOCIATIONS OF MUTATIONS WITH OVERALL SURVIVAL.
Test_Line_9183 In patients who have received standard-dose cytarabine induction and have residual blasts without hypoplasia, additional therapy with standard-dose cytarabine and anthracycline should be considered.
Test_Line_9184 Oligonucleotide primers for amplification of exons 1-9 of PTEN/MMAC1 are shown in Table I.
Test_Line_9185 A clonal disorder of haematopoiesis that is characterized by the expansion of monocytes within the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood, as well as dysplasia of myeloid-precursor cellular elements.
Test_Line_9186 Patients with a higher level of FLT3-TKD mutations (> 25%) had a significantly higher 5-year OS rate compared with those with lower levels of mutations, which showed an OS rate similar to that of patients without FLT3-TKD mutations (71% vs. 37%; adjusted P = .004).
Test_Line_9187 C-terminal mutations might be associated with a more frequent and rapid AML transformation.
Test_Line_9188 S505N mutation has been associated with familial autosomal dominant thrombocytosis.
Test_Line_9189 Two variations, GATA2 R396Q (c.1187G A; supplemental Figure 1) and NEK11 D87Y, both genes located on the chromosome 3 that are separated by 2.7 Mb, were identified in the mother and in the 3 children's samples but were absent in the father's sample.
Test_Line_9190 JAK2.
Test_Line_9191 Additional investigations may include bone marrow biopsy that demonstrate trilineage myeloproliferation and/or the presence of endogenous erythroid colonies on peripheral smear.
Test_Line_9192 In patients older than 60 years, no major difference was observed (9.6 vs. 11.6 months, respectively).
Test_Line_9193 Hydroxyurea also has been shown to effectively reduce the JAK2V617 allelic burden (molecular remission), although the long-term implications of this remain unclear.
Test_Line_9194 Examination of log (2log) survival plots and partial residuals confirmed that the underlying assumption of proportional hazards was met except in the case wherein survival curves are equal during the first 12 months and separate drastically thereafter (Figure 3); we therefore dichotomized follow-up into before and after 12 months.
Test_Line_9195 The conflicting findings from the above studies require further investigation.
Test_Line_9196 She died from a refractory disease after several lines of chemotherapy.
Test_Line_9197 Cohesin haploinsufficiency is thus the operative pathophysiologic mechanism, a notion further supported by the mutual exclusivity of cohesin mutations: haploinsufficiency for one cohesin complex member may be sufficient to initiate the myeloid transformation pathway, whereas a double hit would be deleterious.
Test_Line_9198 The most frequent exon 12 mutation involves an in-frame deletion of six nucleotides at codons 542 and 543 (N542_E543del); it is present in approximately 40% of V617F-negative PV.
Test_Line_9199 Another option for this group is 1 to 2 cycles of high-dose cytarabine-based consolidation followed by autologous HSCT (category 2B).
Test_Line_9200 These latter patients showed a higher incidence of leukemic transformation compared with both CALR-mutant (P = .016) and JAK2-mutated patients (P = .043).
Test_Line_9201 These studies revealed that deletion of Dnmt3a resulted in progressive expansion of the long-term haematopoietic stem cell (LT-HSC) pool without increasing HSC proliferation or altering haematopoietic differentiation.
Test_Line_9202 Because of their distinct biological and clinical features, "AML with mutated NPM1" and "AML with mutated CEBPA" are already recognized as provisional entities in the 2008 WHO classification.
Test_Line_9203 Approximately one-third of SCN patients eventually acquire truncation mutations in CSF3R (analogous to the truncation mutations we have observed in de novo CNL and aCML), which are associated with transformation to myelodysplasia or AML.
Test_Line_9204 In this study, samples with abnormal sequencing results were subjected to repeated analyses by DNA PCR using alternative primer pairs to confirm the presence of unequivocal mutations.
Test_Line_9205 Standardization.
Test_Line_9206 These findings indicate that mutations in specific genes help explain the clinical heterogeneity of myelodysplastic syndromes and that the identification of these abnormalities would improve the prediction of prognosis in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_9207 In addition to these newly defined, high-frequency mutations in SETBP1 and CSF3R, other recurrent mutations in a variety of genes including NRAS, IDH2, and CBL have recently been described in aCML at lower frequencies.
Test_Line_9208 Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) is currently the only therapy with curative potential for PMF; however, treatment-related mortality remains high.
Test_Line_9209 In a broad survey of mutations in 439 primary DNA samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, we identified point mutations in 18 genes, including 2 (ETV6 and GNAS) that have not previously been reported to harbor mutations in such patients.
Test_Line_9210 This suggests a crucial role for epigenetic modifiers in the regulation of normal haematopoiesis and illustrates how the loss of normal epigenetic functionality can contribute to leukaemogenesis.
Test_Line_9211 Clonal hierarchy analysis was performed to determine if cohesin complex gene variants were ancestral or secondary genetic events.
Test_Line_9212 Further work may identify additional readers of 5-hmC and evaluate the function of MBD3 in other cellular contexts.
Test_Line_9213 These findings were confirmed in subsequent analyses from other large cooperative group studies.
Test_Line_9214 Clinical evolution.
Test_Line_9215 DATABASES.
Test_Line_9216 PV.
Test_Line_9217 Two of our CMML patients had biallelic heterozygous mutations, one carrying two missense mutations and the other carrying two frameshift mutations on separate alleles by cloning analysis.
Test_Line_9218 Estey et al prospectively evaluated a protocol in which patients aged 50 years and older with unfavorable cytogenetics would be evaluated for a RIC allogeneic HSCT.
Test_Line_9219 Evidence that accounting for JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status improves the risk stratification provided by IPSS.
Test_Line_9220 Tests for these molecular markers are becoming more common in commercial reference laboratories and in referral centers.
Test_Line_9221 IDH1 mutation was also associated with worse EFS and OS outcomes among the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk NK-AML (wild-type NPM1 without FLT3-ITD).
Test_Line_9222 Such a splicing abnormality was more prominent in cases with SRSF2 mutations but not detected in the cases with SF3B1 mutations or WT spliceosomal genes.
Test_Line_9223 Clinically, epigenetic mutations occur in combination with both class I and class II genes and also occasionally with each other (FIG. 5).
Test_Line_9224 Toxic effects were generally managed with dose modification.
Test_Line_9225 Statistical Analysis.
Test_Line_9226 Cohesin complex mutations as a group had no prognostic impact in all and in cytogenetically normal AML patients.
Test_Line_9227 Survival outcomes between these groups were similar, with a 3-year OS rates of 63% and 61%, respectively.
Test_Line_9228 The durability of spleen response and survival were analyzed with the use of the Kaplan- Meier method.
Test_Line_9229 For the purpose of this study, nonsynonymous variants known to be pathogenic, rare, or with unknown genotypic frequency variants in general population are included.
Test_Line_9230 Deletions involving chromosome 7q, which includes EZH2, have long been incorporated into clinical cytogenetic prognostic schemas for patients with MDS or AML.
Test_Line_9231 In 2005, it was observed that many patients with "classic BCR-ABL1-negative" MPDs (PV, ET, and PMF; Figure 1) carried the somatic mutation JAK2V617F, which had important implications for classification, diagnosis, and potential targeted therapy.
Test_Line_9232 Perhaps additional emphasis should be placed on understanding the pathogenicity of these diseases to gain insight in other potential therapies.
Test_Line_9233 We estimated the time to development of anemia (here defined as a hemoglobin level <10 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet [PLT] count <100 x 109/L), and marked leukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count >25 x 109/L) using a competing risk approach.
Test_Line_9234 If there is doubt, a peripheral blood or a bone marrow specimen collected at a later time point may be used to confirm the finding.
Test_Line_9235 In terms of clinical features, triple-negative PMF is similar to the myelodysplastic syndrome associated with bone marrow fibrosis that we described previously.
Test_Line_9236 Given the molecular heterogeneity of myeloid neoplasms, precise establishment of the clinical impact of these leukemia disease alleles and their relevance to clinical phenotype, somatic genotype, and clinical outcome requires large patient cohorts with detailed clinical annotation.
Test_Line_9237 These data suggest that in the favorablerisk subgroup of patients with AML, the potential advantage with allogeneic HSCT in preventing relapse may be offset by high rates of transplant-related deaths.
Test_Line_9238 If a clinical trial is not an option, then low-intensity therapy or supportive care may be the appropriate choice.
Test_Line_9239 Initial reports indicated a significantly better overall survival for SF3B1 mutated cases compared to unmutated cases in MDS, while other studies showed no significant impact of the mutations on survival.
Test_Line_9240 Exclusionary criteria include no evidence of a reactive neutrophilia, other MPN, MDS, or overlap MDS/MPN disorder.
Test_Line_9241 Additional cytogenic and molecular markers have since been characterized, and their role continues to evolve.
Test_Line_9242 However, preliminary evidence suggests that further work along these lines will probably yield greater predictive value in the near future.
Test_Line_9243 AML patients were classified according to French-American-British criteria as follows: M1, ten patients; M2, fourteen; M3, fifteen; M4, eleven; M5, eight; M6, four patients.
Test_Line_9244 Bone marrow fibrosis secondary to PV or ET can be differentiated from PMF by bone marrow histology.
Test_Line_9245 For example, DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1/2 and ASXL1 are among most frequent targets of gene mutations in both MDS and normal karyotype AML.
Test_Line_9246 Combination therapy with thalidomide and prednisone or lenalidomide and prednisone is associated with higher response rates, 40% and 30%, respectively, and decreased toxicity.

Test_Line_9251 Targeted gene panels assessed by next-generation sequencing are increasingly being used in clinical laboratories.
Test_Line_9252 No differences were observed with respect to sex, blood counts, percentage of blasts in blood, subtype of CMML, cytogenetic risk group or International Prognostic Scoring System between CMML patients with RUNX1 mutations and those without mutations.
Test_Line_9253 Although splenic irradiation and splenectomy may provide transient palliation of symptomatic splenomegaly, the latter has been associated with anecdotal worsening of neutrophilic leukocytosis in CNL.
Test_Line_9254 The monthly prevalence of grade 3 or 4 anemia and the proportion of patients requiring transfusions (1 or more units of red cells) also followed a pattern that was consistent with changes in the hemoglobin level over time (Fig.
Test_Line_9255 Do BCOR and BCORL1 mutations have any clinical impact in AML?
Test_Line_9256 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Test_Line_9257 Table 1. Clinicohematological characteristics and mutation patterns of patients with RUNX1 mutations at initial diagnosis of CMML.
Test_Line_9258 The survival outcome for patients with unfavorable cytogenetics was poor, with a median OS of only 10 months in both treatment arms.
Test_Line_9259 In contrast, the membrane proximal mutations exhibit receptor activation in the complete absence of ligand, suggesting distinct mechanisms of activation of these classes of CSF3R mutations.
Test_Line_9260 The role of mutations in epigenetic regulators in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9261 Further, the putative candidates were prioritized based on population genotypic frequency.
Test_Line_9262 Patients in both treatment arms received only 2 cycles of standard-dose cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide for consolidation therapy.
Test_Line_9263 R882 is the most commonly mutated residue.
Test_Line_9264 Next-generation amplicon deep-sequencing data were analyzed using Sequence Pilot version 3.4 (JSI Medical Systems, Kippenheim, Germany).
Test_Line_9265 The panel uniformly endorsed allogeneic HSCT with matched sibling or matched unrelated donor (including cord blood) or clinical trial as consolidation therapy for patients with poor-risk cytogenetics or molecular abnormalities.
Test_Line_9266 The latest iteration replaced the term myeloproliferative disorders with "myeloproliferative neoplasms" (MPN) and incorporated systemic mastocytosis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia-not otherwise specified, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and MPN-unclassifiable into the existing MPD category.
Test_Line_9267 The disease course of CNL is variable, but acceleration is typically characterized by refractory neutrophilia, worsening organomegaly, and blastic transformation.
Test_Line_9268 Inferior predictors of survival in PMF secondary to PV and ET are similar for de novo disease, and patients may be risk stratified in a comparable manner.
Test_Line_9269 In addition, detailed studies of the genomic methylation landscape of AML have identified distinct profiles that can subclassify patients based on methylation patterns and a core set of genes that are commonly methylated in AML cells compared with normal haematopoietic cells.
Test_Line_9270 Somatic point mutations are common in myelodysplastic syndromes and are associated with specific clinical features.
Test_Line_9271 Another option for this group is 1 to 2 cycles of high-dose cytarabine-based consolidation followed by autologous HSCT, if allogeneic transplant is not an available option.
Test_Line_9272 Furthermore, patients receiving ruxolitinib had reductions in plasma levels of C-reactive protein and the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6, and they had increases in levels of plasma leptin and erythropoietin (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9273 Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 that result in neomorphic enzymatic activity may represent novel, tractable targets for this genetically defined subset of leukaemia patients.
Test_Line_9274 RT-PCR and cDNA Sequencing Analysis.
Test_Line_9275 Because BCOR (and BCORL1) are ubiquitously expressed, it will be crucial to define the key targets of their corepressive transcriptional activity specifically in AML cells, in order to gain more precise insights into mechanistic role of BCOR and BCORL1 mutations in leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_9276 Although genome-wide mapping studies of 5-hmC in the haematopoietic system have not yet been reported, genome-wide mapping of 5-hmC in embryonic stem cells has identified that 5-hmC is most often present at transcription start sites and within gene bodies.
Test_Line_9277 Subsequent sequencing of this gene in other samples revealed several point mutations that were confirmed to be somatic on examination of matched buccal-swab DNA.
Test_Line_9278 In a recent report that evaluated the ELN risk classification in a large cohort of patients, those in the "Intermediate I" risk group (which includes all patients with NK-AML with FLT3 abnormalities and those lacking both FLT3 and NPM1 mutations), relapse-free survival was more favorable with allogeneic HSCT (94 vs. 7.9 months without allogeneic HSCT).
Test_Line_9279 The impact of the driver mutations on OS was independent of IPSS at diagnosis and of time-dependent DIPSS (maximum P value equal to .033).
Test_Line_9280 The current challenge is to develop a prognostic model that accounts for both clinical and molecular parameters, including relevant subclonal mutations, and that in perspective may be useful also for predicting response to different treatments.
Test_Line_9281 Patients who received initial chemotherapy and experienced a CR had a 45% DFS rate, compared with 10% for patients who did not experience response to chemotherapy before transplantation.
Test_Line_9282 Patients with PV are considered low risk if they are <60 years old and have no history of thrombosis or are high risk if they are >=60 years old or have a history of thrombosis.
Test_Line_9283 Although the results of clinical correlative studies have not been uniform, in the largest series, TET2 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis in patients with favourable-risk, cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), whereas studies have failed to demonstrate a consistent prognostic relevance of TET2 mutations in patients with MPN or MDS.
Test_Line_9284 This uses bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype and the number of cytopenias to determine a risk score that is then used to predict median survival and time to transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Test_Line_9285 No homozygous mutations have been reported for these three genes.
Test_Line_9286 The cumulative incidence of marked leukocytosis was significantly lower in CALR-mutant patients compared with JAK2-mutant (P = .004) or triple-negative patients (P <.001).
Test_Line_9287 In a phase 1-2 trial of ruxolitinib (INCB018424, Incyte), a potent inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, patients with myelofibrosis had durable reductions in splenomegaly and improvements in myelofibrosis-related symptoms, regardless of their status with respect to the JAK2V617F mutation.
Test_Line_9288 The vast majority of mutations identified across cohesin proteins were heterozygous nonsense and frameshift events, which would be anticipated to cause expression of a truncated protein.
Test_Line_9289 Previous version of these guidelines have used cytogenetics as the major defining criteria for risk of relapse.
Test_Line_9290 He was treated by HSCT and is still in complete remission 2.5 years after the transplantation.
Test_Line_9291 RUNX1 is also known as AML1 and acts to regulate the expression of various genes specific for hematopoiesis, including G-CSF, IL-3, T-cell receptor and myeloperoxidase.
Test_Line_9292 The 10-year cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation was 19.4% (95% CI, 13.9-25.6) in JAK2-mutant, 9.4% (95% CI, 4.3-16.8) in CALR-mutant, 16.9% (95% CI, 4.1-37.1) in MPL-mutant, and 34.4% (95% CI, 16.8-52.8) in triple-negative subjects (Figure 3).

Test_Line_9294 Postremission Therapy: Patients who achieve a CR (including CRi) with standard induction chemotherapy may receive further consolidation with these agents.
Test_Line_9295 In addition to clearly hypomorphic mutations, splice site mutations were also identified (eg, STAG2 5' of exon 4 and 8).
Test_Line_9296 We aimed to identify the prevalence of mutations in CMML, identify any associations between them, as well as their correlation with morphology, cytogenetics and survival.
Test_Line_9297 For patients with NKAML, the remission rates are 40% to 50% with cytarabine combined with idarubicin, daunorubicin or mitoxantrone.
Test_Line_9298 TET2 is a putative tumor suppressor gene and mutational frequency is estimated at 16% for PV, 5% for ET, and 17% for PMF.
Test_Line_9299 PCR-SSCP Analysis.
Test_Line_9300 Peroxisomes.
Test_Line_9301 It has already been suggested that NPM1 is an early event in leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_9302 Future experience with these agents will inform whether complete hematologic remissions and indepth molecular responses are realized, similar to experience with TKIs in CML and PDGFRA/B-rearranged myeloid neoplasms associated with eosinophilia.
Test_Line_9303 Mutations in CSF3R have previously been identified in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN).
Test_Line_9304 Given the diversity of known MPL mutations, the precise mutation detected should be reported using HGVS-standard nucleotide and amino acid nomenclature.
Test_Line_9305 Two-sided P values <.05 were considered significant in the primary analysis and indicators for a trend in all additional analyses.
Test_Line_9306 There were 55 CMML1 and 26 CMML2 patients.
Test_Line_9307 Median OS was 17.7 years in CALR-mutant, 9.2 years in JAK2-mutant, 9.1 years in MPL-mutant, and 3.2 years in triple-negative patients, as shown in Figure 4.
Test_Line_9308 Therefore, we investigated ASXL1 exon 12 mutations in 79/81 cases (no DNA available in two cases).
Test_Line_9309 Of note, thus far, we sequenced 463 cases of various myeloid malignancies and detected the corresponding putative ASXL1 mutation 1900_1922del (Glu635ArgfsX16) in 21 patients overall (Supplementary Table 4).
Test_Line_9310 Overall Survival.
Test_Line_9311 Patients with an ECOG performance status score of greater than 2 or those with significant comorbidities (regardless of performance status score) are more likely to experience toxicity and less likely to benefit from standard-induction chemotherapy.
Test_Line_9312 Epigenetic mutations are modifications that are reversible with therapy.
Test_Line_9313 In 2008, the WHO revised the diagnostic and response criteria for AML to include additional recurrent genetic abnormalities created by reciprocal translocations/inversions, and a new provisional category for some of the molecular markers that have been found to have prognostic impact.
Test_Line_9314 The karyotype identified a trisomy 11 and a partial deletion of chromosome 7.
Test_Line_9315 ANC indicates absolute neutrophil count; ALC, absolute lymphocyte count; AMC, absolute monocyte count; Hb, hemoglobin; HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; MDS, myelodysplastic syndrome; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; CR, complete remission; and HPV, human papillomavirus.
Test_Line_9316 In a recent report of 122 patients treated with high-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin, the remission rates were strongly influenced by cytogenetics, with CR rates of 87%, 79%, and 62% for favorable-, intermediate-, and poor-risk groups, respectively.
Test_Line_9317 Blood count and BM examination were normal.
Test_Line_9318 The strongest correlation was found in PMF, where 33% of 109 patients had cytogenetic abnormalities, including +8, 13q-, 20q-, and abnormalities of chromosomes 1, 7, and 9.
Test_Line_9319 Increased response rates have also been reported when lenalidomide is used in patients with del(5)(q31).
Test_Line_9320 Comparisons of quantitative variables between groups of patients were carried out by the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test.
Test_Line_9321 CSF3R truncation mutations result in a loss of a portion of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, suggesting possible molecular mechanisms for receptor activation.
Test_Line_9322 AS, allele-specific; LNA, locked nucleic acid; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism.
Test_Line_9323 Additional JAK2 mutations have now been described on exon 12, with N542-E543 being the most common.
Test_Line_9324 We identified 6 mutations of GATA2 among these 14 cases, 5 point mutations and a large deletion of 61 kb completely overlapping the GATA2 locus.
Test_Line_9325 Although FISH studies for common cytogenetic abnormalities may provide a rapid screening to identify either favorable or unfavorable risk groups, they do not provide a full picture of the genetic factors, which contribute to risk.
Test_Line_9326 The SETBP1 mutants disrupt this consensus b-TrCP motif, leading to increased SETBP1 and SET expression, which lowers PP2A activity and increases proliferation of cells.
Test_Line_9327 A series of normal DNA samples should be analyzed to derive the threshold for a positive result.
Test_Line_9328 JAK2V617F is a tyrosine kinase gain-of-function mutation in exon 14 that results from a guanine-to-thymine transversion at nucleotide 1849 with substitution of valine to phenylalanine at codon 617.
Test_Line_9329 DFS rate (for patients with a CR) and OS rate (for all patients) at 4 years was not significantly different between treatment arms.
Test_Line_9330 The analytic components include the analytic result (mutation detected or not detected) and a brief description of the methodology used.
Test_Line_9331 According to a recent report, knock down of U2AF1 expression leads to the skipping of a specific exon of FECH during splicing.
Test_Line_9332 Twenty-one patients had 23 mutations (72%) located in the N-terminal part and the remaining 9 patients had single mutations located in the C-terminal region.
Test_Line_9333 The percentage of BM blasts was 9.5+=1.1% in patients with mutations compared with 7.1+=0.7% in mutation-negative patients (P = 0.073).
Test_Line_9334 Mutations in multiple genes were associated with overall survival in univariate analyses (Table 1).
Test_Line_9335 The cytogenetic risk group is defined according to Medical Research Council criteria.
Test_Line_9336 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_9337 One patient each had trisomy 13 and trisomy 21 in the whole cohort of CMML patients; it is of note that both patients harbored RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_9338 JAK2FV617F allelic burden was only decreased 13% in bone marrow and 9% in peripheral blood from baseline.
Test_Line_9339 This explains, at least in part, the lack of efficacy of ATRA in PLZF-RARalpha-positive APL (FIG. 4).
Test_Line_9340 Differences in the mutational spectrum and clinical correlates of TET2 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in myeloid malignancies might be explained by the range of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzymes that are impaired by IDH1 and IDH2 mutations compared with TET2 mutations, which only directly affect the function of TET2.
Test_Line_9341 Ta-Chih Liu; Pai-Mei Lin; Jan-Gowth Chang; Jing-Ping Lee; Tyen-Po Chen; Sheng-Fung Lin.
Test_Line_9342 Analysis from first referral may clearly lead to underestimation of survival.
Test_Line_9343 All the authors contributed to subsequent drafts and made the decision to submit the article for publication.
Test_Line_9344 The clinical and laboratory features of CNL include hepato/splenomegaly, persistent neutrophilic leukocytosis with minimal left shift often characterized by toxic granulation and Dohle o bodies, and elevated leukocyte alkaline phosphatase and vitamin B12 levels.
Test_Line_9345 Workup.
Test_Line_9346 CONCLUSION.
Test_Line_9347 The MonoMAC syndrome is characterized by a severe deficiency of monocytes, B-lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, along with nontuberculous mycobacterial, fungal, and viral infections and an autosomal-dominant transmission in most cases.
Test_Line_9348 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_9349 No consensus result was obtained with four of the specimens.
Test_Line_9350 Initially, the intrathecal therapy should be given twice weekly until the cytology shows no blasts, and then weekly for 4 to 6 weeks.
Test_Line_9351 Abnormal bands detected by SSCP analysis were analyzed for mutation by direct sequencing.
Test_Line_9352 Additionally, similar to our observations in CNL/aCML, SCN patients can acquire compound CSF3R mutations.
Test_Line_9353 RFS endpoints measured from the date of documented CR were relapse (failure), death in CR (failure), and alive in CR at last follow-up (censored).
Test_Line_9354 A low-positive control should be included in each run, to demonstrate that the assay is performing at the level of the measured sensitivity.
Test_Line_9355 Primary analysis was performed on OS.
Test_Line_9356 In the ELN guidelines, patients with NK-AML with both mutated NPM1 and FLT3, and those with wild-type NPM1 and mutated FLT3 or wild-type NPM1 and FLT3 are categorized as having intermediate-risk AML ("Intermediate I" group).
Test_Line_9357 Splenectomy is considered in refractory patients, patients who require frequent transfusions or who have significant portal hypertension.
Test_Line_9358 In STAG2, we detected mutations in 17 females (14 heterozygous and 3 homozygous) and in 44 males (hemizygous).
Test_Line_9359 We studied the impact of driver mutations of JAK2, CALR, (calreticulin gene) or MPL on clinical course, leukemic transformation, and survival of patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Test_Line_9360 The median age at the diagnosis of MDS or AML was 15 years (range, 7-35).
Test_Line_9361 Moreover, mutations and in-frame translocations of MLL are now known to result in malignant transformation directly through alterations in post-translational histone modification (see REF. 91 for an excellent review on MLL).
Test_Line_9362 A post hoc analysis showed that patients who received ruxolitinib had improvement in each individual symptom assessed on the MFSAF (Fig. 2C), whereas symptoms worsened in the placebo group (P<0.01 for all comparisons with placebo).
Test_Line_9363 One patient had a silent mutation at RHD (no. 9), which had been reported earlier; it is considered to have no effect on function.
Test_Line_9364 The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating site.
Test_Line_9365 The recent shortages of several chemotherapy agents have raised the question of how best to use cytarabine.
Test_Line_9366 MPL was identified as a candidate for MPN pathogenesis when it was described in the downstream signaling pathway required for JAK2V617F-mediated transformation of myeloprogenitor cells.
Test_Line_9367 In our cohort, we identified mutations in genes of the cohesin complex in 23 AML patients (5.9%).
Test_Line_9368 Mutations in RUNX1, TP53, and NRAS were most strongly associated with severe thrombocytopenia (P<0.001 for all comparisons) and an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts (P<0.006 for all comparisons).
Test_Line_9369 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_9370 Importantly, they occurred at a higher frequency (about 17%; 14 of 82 cases) in the subset of CN-AML devoid of NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3-ITD, and MLLPTD mutations, and mostly also lacking IDH1 mutations.
Test_Line_9371 The impact of genetic lesions on survival was independent of current prognostic scoring systems.
Test_Line_9372 Although clonality has been demonstrated in CNL, the majority of patients exhibit normal cytogenetics.
Test_Line_9373 Informed consent was obtained according to protocols approved by the institutional review boards and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Test_Line_9374 As with JAK2 exon 12 mutations, these mutations occur predominantly in JAK2V617F-negative clones.
Test_Line_9375 No specimen was negative for all 12 laboratories, again presumably reflecting poorer reproducibility at the low end and possibly indicating high sensitivity (which could result in false-positive results).
Test_Line_9376 Expression array and RNA sequencing.
Test_Line_9377 These markers include FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), c-KIT, nucleophosmin (NPM1), and CEBPA gene mutations.
Test_Line_9378 The "protective effect" of SF3B1 mutation on OS was lost in multivariate analysis, including clinical variables such as International Prognostic Scoring System score.
Test_Line_9379 Multiple steps were performed to reduce the false-positive rate within reported results.
Test_Line_9380 Two cases showed a complex deletion from exons 1 to 8 but retained 21 bp of exon 7 (Fig. 2).
Test_Line_9381 Mechanistic studies to understand their functional and pathophysiological role are currently underway, but our genetic data suggest that cohesin mutations do not contribute to hematopoietic transformation through altered chromosomal instability.
Test_Line_9382 A total of 155 patients in the ruxolitinib group and 151 in the placebo group received at least one dose of the study medication and were included in the analysis of safety.
Test_Line_9383 Interestingly, more recent data suggests that cohesin genes have additional functions within the cell such as double-strand DNA repair and regulation of transcription.
Test_Line_9384 Among the subgroup of patients aged 60 to 65 years (n = 299), an advantage with dose-escalated compared with standard-dose daunorubicin was observed with regard to rates of CR (73% vs. 51%), 2-year EFS (29% vs. 14%), and 2-year OS (38% vs. 23%).
Test_Line_9385 CGH analysis.
Test_Line_9386 Taken together, our data suggest that cohesin mutations do not affect patient prognosis.
Test_Line_9387 The resulting risk categories were very low (score = 0), low (score = 1), intermediate (score 2 or 3), high (score 4 or 5), and very high (score >=6).
Test_Line_9388 Almost all patients receiving ruxolitinib had some degree of reduction in spleen volume (Fig. 1B).
Test_Line_9389 Mutations in the cohesin-complex have already been described in colorectal cancer, and there has been a link between these mutations and chromosomal instability.
Test_Line_9390 Patients.
Test_Line_9391 To date, biological consequences of splicing factor mutations have been tested only for U2AF35 mutants.
Test_Line_9392 More recently, mutant JAK2 was shown to phosphorylate PRMT5, an arginine methyltransferase, much more effectively than wild-type JAK2 (REF. 94).
Test_Line_9393 Average depth was 124x.
Test_Line_9394 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_9395 Of note, in the vast majority of cases the remaining DNMT3A allele remains wild-type, suggesting that DNMT3A haploinsufficiency is sufficient to contribute to myeloid transformation.
Test_Line_9396 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_9397 JAK2V617 is present in more than 95% of patients with PV, and serum EPO levels are appropriately subnormal in more than 90% of patients.
Test_Line_9398 These studies show that monosomal karyotype, independent of other unfavorable cytogenetic factors, confers very poor prognosis in both young and older patients with AML.
Test_Line_9399 IDH1 mutation was found to occur concurrently with NK-AML and NPM1 mutations.
Test_Line_9400 When considering the type of CALR mutation, patients carrying a type 1 CALR mutation had a better OS compared with patients carrying JAK2 (V617F) (P <.001).
Test_Line_9401 Data concerning the prognostic significance of DNMT3A mutations have thus far been conflicting.
Test_Line_9402 There is a lack of well-established consensus concerning common analytical issues, such as what specimen type should be tested, whether it is clinically relevant to differentiate heterozygous from homozygous mutations, whether granulocyte enrichment should be performed, how to interpret a low level of a positive result, and whether quantitative results should be used and reported (and, if yes, in which disease type and in what clinical condition).
Test_Line_9403 Future Directions for JAK2 and MPL Mutation Testing.
Test_Line_9404 For comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis, genomic DNA samples were analyzed for copy number changes using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP 6.0 arrays (for pedigree 1) or CytoScan HD arrays (for other pedigrees when material was available).
Test_Line_9405 The 4-year OS rate among intermediate-risk patients was 54% for the no-donor group and 53% for the donor group.
Test_Line_9406 The PCR reactions were carried out for 35 cycles under the following conditions: 1.5 min at 94--Degree--C for denaturation, 1.5 min at 52--56--Degree--C for annealing, 2 min at 72--Degree--C for extension, and a final extension at 72--Degree--C for 5 min.
Test_Line_9407 Changes in palpable spleen length in the ruxolitinib and placebo groups mirrored the changes in spleen volume.
Test_Line_9408 We examined the other members of the family (mother, father, the 2 other sons, maternal grandfather, maternal grandmother, and maternal cousins) for the presence of these variations.
Test_Line_9409 Also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The Krebs cycle is a series of chemical reactions that is used by all aerobic organisms to generate NADH and certain amino acids through the oxidation of acetate.
Test_Line_9410 Recently, the transcription factor GATA2 has been identified as a new predisposing gene for familial AML/MDS.
Test_Line_9411 The incidence of monosomal karyotype increased with age, from 4% in patients aged 30 years or younger to 20% in those older than 60 years.
Test_Line_9412 Point mutations have been also identified in diseases that overlap with familial AML/MDS, such as Emberger and MonoMAC syndromes.
Test_Line_9413 Our data further suggest that cohesin has a cooperative role in epigenetic regulation and transcriptional programming by virtue of the higher response rate in cohesin mutant MDS patients treated with HMAs.
Test_Line_9414 Krebs cycle.
Test_Line_9415 The model reported in Figure 6 was developed with the only objective of showing, as a proof of concept, that genetic data can significantly improve prognostication of PMF.
Test_Line_9416 In particular, members of the jumonji-domain-containing (JMJC) family of histone lysine demethylases, which demethylate lysines 9 and 36 of histone H3 (H3K9 and H3K36), have been shown to be inhibited by 2-HG.
Test_Line_9417 Longer-term follow-up will be required to better define rates of AML transformation.
Test_Line_9418 No mutations were observed in any of the AML or other tumor cell lines.
Test_Line_9419 According to the NCCN AML Panel, infusional cytarabine x 7 days combined with either idarubicin or escalated daunorubicin is a category 1 recommendation.
Test_Line_9420 Based on retrospective analysis of data from large cooperative group studies, 40% to 50% of patients with de novo AML have normal karyotype, which is associated with an intermediate risk in terms of survival outcomes.
Test_Line_9421 Other relevant genes were assessed for frequently occurring mutations or expression levels as previously described (ie, FLT3-ITD, nucleophosmin1 [NPM1], DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, and MLL5).
Test_Line_9422 Cohesin mutations co-occur with other mutations known to be drivers of clonal evolution.
Test_Line_9423 Three years later, at age 14, her second child (patient number 6225; P1, III, 3) developed an AML M2 associated with myelodysplasia-related changes with a similar cytologic presentation to his mother.
Test_Line_9424 Mutations in the spliceosome machinery, a novel and ubiquitous pathway in leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_9425 Presenting hematologic and clinical features of PMF patients according to JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status Of the 617 patients studied, 399 (64.7%) carried JAK2 (V617F), 140 (22.7%) a CALR exon 9 indel, 25 (4.0%) an MPL (W515) mutation, and 53 (8.6%) had nonmutated JAK2, MPL, and CALR (ie, triple-negative subjects).
Test_Line_9426 Although the exact incidence of therapy-related MDS/AML is unknown, and varies depending on the types of treatment modalities used for a given primary tumor, recent reports suggest that therapy-related MDS/AML may account for 5% to 20% of patients with MDS/AML.
Test_Line_9427 RA with excess blasts (RAEB1 and RAEB2) cases were considered as high-risk MDS.
Test_Line_9428 Although the biological ramifications of activating EZH2 mutations in lymphomagenesis are not well understood, biochemical studies have shown that Y641 mutation increases dimethylation and trimethylation of H3K27 despite impaired H3K27 monomethylation.
Test_Line_9429 Figure 1. (a) Frequencies and distribution of mutations. Frequencies are given for molecular mutations in EZH2, TET2, ASXL1, CBL, NRAS, KRAS, JAK2, RUNX1, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1 and MPL. Each patient is represented by a colored box. The patient cohort is further annotated according to karyotype and diagnostic category. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates of 81 CMML cases. (b) Data are shown for overall survival of CMML patients including EZH2-mutated patients (n = 9) and EZH2 wild-type patients (n = 72; alive at 3 years: 33.3 versus 69.9%). (c) Data are shown for overall survival of CMML patients including EZH2-mutated patients (n = 9), EZH2/TET2 wild-type patients (n = 40) and TET2-mutated patients with EZH2 wild-type (n = 32; alive at 3 years: 33.9 versus 49.7 versus 89.8%).
Test_Line_9430 Therefore, we performed exome sequencing on the AML diagnosis sample of the second son (patient number 6225).
Test_Line_9431 In addition, mutations in specific epigenetic modifiers including DNMT3A and MLL predict benefit from dose-intensified induction therapy with daunorubicin, which suggests that these mutant disease alleles affect the response to classical cytotoxic therapies.
Test_Line_9432 Sixty-two specimens of bone marrow and/or peripheral blood were obtained from patients diagnosed with AML at the Kaohsiung Medical College Hospital from 1992 through 1996.
Test_Line_9433 About two-thirds of mutations were either nonsense or frameshift changes, causing a premature stop codon.
Test_Line_9434 There is longstanding, yet debatable evidence that a reduction in hematocrit (Hct) level to <45% reduces the risk of vaso-occlusive events.
Test_Line_9435 Epigenetic modifiers provide new targets for therapeutic intervention.
Test_Line_9436 Because long-term survival is high with PV and ET, survival prediction may only be valuable if aggressive therapy is to be considered.
Test_Line_9437 Ficoll density centrifugation should be avoided, because it depletes the granulocytic population (which carries the mutations).
Test_Line_9438 Only 1 patient with favorable cytogenetics had a mutation in a cohesin gene (SMC1A), whereas the majority of patients with cohesin gene mutations had intermediate risk cytogenetics, most showing a normal karyotype (supplemental Tables 1 and 2-6).
Test_Line_9439 Recurrent hypomorphic cohesin defects and cohesin low expression were identified in a significant proportion of patients with MDS and AML.
Test_Line_9440 One laboratory tested only a subset of the specimens.
Test_Line_9441 RAS mutations are frequent events in CMML.
Test_Line_9442 A reasonable treatment regimen for these patients includes standard-dose cytarabine (100-200 mg/m2 by continuous infusion per day x 7 days) along with 3 days of anthracycline.
Test_Line_9443 Third, mutations with a quality score of <8000 or an allele frequency of <15% were excluded.
Test_Line_9444 In the current work, we studied a large population of patients with PMF followed at 4 different centers and analyzed the impact of driver mutations of JAK2, CALR, or MPL on clinical course, risk of leukemic transformation, and OS.
Test_Line_9445 These analyses were performed using JMP9 (SAS, Cary, NC) and R-statistical language.
Test_Line_9446 The cohesin complex is composed of 2 long structural maintenance proteins, SMC1A and SMC3, which heterodimerize at the hinge domain, forming a closed loop by binding at the alpha-klesin end to RAD21 and adapter proteins STAG1/STAG2.
Test_Line_9447 Data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program have estimated the annual age-adjusted incidence of BCR-ABL1-negative MPD to be 2.1 per 100,000, with an overall 3-year survival rate of 80%.
Test_Line_9448 Table 1. JAK2 Mutations in Myeloproliferative Neoplasms.
Test_Line_9449 The mutational status of RUNX1 was also correlated with the clinicohematological characteristics in our patients with CMML at initial diagnosis.
Test_Line_9450 Mutations have been described previously in congenital neutropenia that is isolated (eg, mutations of ELANE), associated with immunologic defects (eg, mutations of CXCR4 or WAS genes), or involves extra-hematopoietic manifestations, the most frequent being HAX1 (Kostmann disease), SDBS (Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome), or G6PC3.
Test_Line_9451 JAK2 mutations are known to activate canonical cytokine signalling pathways through the phosphorylation of STAT proteins.
Test_Line_9452 As low expression of these genes may have functionally equivalent consequences, we defined a subset of patients with altered expression of the cohesin complex in an additional 15% of patients.
Test_Line_9453 Our data indicate that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene may not play a major role in AML.
Test_Line_9454 In a review of data from adult patients treated on a phase III SWOG/ECOG intergroup study (N = 609), the 5-year survival rates for those with favorable, intermediate-risk, and unfavorable cytogenetics were 55%, 38%, and 11%, respectively.
Test_Line_9455 STRs were amplified by PCR (primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1) and analyzed by GeneScan analysis performed on an Applied Biosystems 3130XL.
Test_Line_9456 The integration of mutation assessment in diagnostic classification and prognostic scoring systems has the potential to parse diverse myelodysplastic syndromes into a set of discrete diseases with predictable clinical phenotypes, prognosis, and responses to therapy.
Test_Line_9457 Comparisons of proportions were performed by the x2 test and by Fisher's exact test, and differences in values and in ranks were assessed by Student t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests, respectively.
Test_Line_9458 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Test_Line_9459 On the basis of the same phenomenon seen in alternative splicing analysis with the use of mRNAdeep sequencing of U2AF1 mutants, among the 3 most frequently mutated spliceosomal genes, U2AF1 mutations might result in loss of function.
Test_Line_9460 Also, patients with low 5-hmC levels showed hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites.
Test_Line_9461 Technical details about sample processing for SNP-As were previously described.
Test_Line_9462 Whether Pro398Leu has a decreased transactivating ability requires further study.
Test_Line_9463 In the analyses of change from baseline to week 24, patients who discontinued the study drug or crossed over before week 24 were counted as not having a response (for response measures of a reduction in spleen volume and symptom improvement).
Test_Line_9464 These results were confirmed after adjusting for time-dependent DIPSS, with a better OS of patients with type 1 CALR mutation compared with those with JAK2 (V617F) (HR 2.01, P = .04), and no difference between patients with type 1 and those with type 2 CALR mutation, as well as between patients with type 2 CALR mutation and those with JAK2 (V617F).
Test_Line_9465 Age >65, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, leukocytosis > 25 x 109/L, circulating blasts > 1%, and presence of constitutional symptoms.
Test_Line_9466 To assess the prognostic impact of the resulting score, we included the score as a continuous covariate in a Cox survival regression model.
Test_Line_9467 Both the NCCN and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classify patients with NK-AML and mutated NPM1 or CEBPA (without FLT3-ITD) as having favorable risk.
Test_Line_9468 If a diagnosis of PMF or ET is entertained, then MPL analysis should be performed in the setting of a negative JAK2 V617F assay, if required to meet World Health Organization diagnostic criteria.
Test_Line_9469 A recent large retrospective study involved 289 patients with PMF receiving HCT from either HLA-matched identical siblings (162 patients), HLA-matched nonidentical family members (26 patients) or HLA-matched unrelated individuals (101 patients).
Test_Line_9470 A recent paper described a case of a SCN patient who acquired a CSF3R truncation mutation followed by a T618I point mutation (reported as T595I using the traditional CSF3R numbering system that does not include the signal peptide).
Test_Line_9471 They also had a lower risk of thrombosis compared with patients carrying JAK2 (V617F).
Test_Line_9472 Of the 22 laboratories, 13 used in-house tests for JAK2 V617F and the remaining 9 used commercial assays; 14 laboratories performed only qualitative assays, 5 performed only quantitative assays, and 3 performed both quantitative and qualitative assays.
Test_Line_9473 Matched unrelated BM transplantation was performed and was complicated by a grade 4 cutaneous GVHD requiring intensive immunosuppressive therapy.
Test_Line_9474 In aCML, the majority of SETBP1 mutations are located in a 14 amino acid stretch that is also mutated in Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, a rare genetic disease characterized by congenital malformations, mental retardation, and a high prevalence of epithelial tumors.
Test_Line_9475 In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis to twice-daily oral ruxolitinib (155 patients) or placebo (154 patients).
Test_Line_9476 Cytogenetic findings were divided into three categories, namely, good (normal, -Y, del[5q], del[20q]), poor (complex or chromosome 7 anomalies) and intermediate (all other abnormalities), according to the criteria developed by the International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop.
Test_Line_9477 Induction Therapy: The creation of separate guidelines for patients older than 60 years recognizes the poor outcomes in this group treated with standard cytarabine and an anthracycline.
Test_Line_9478 Written informed consent was obtained according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the studies were approved by the institutional review board of Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.
Test_Line_9479 Erik Vakil; Ayalew Tefferi.
Test_Line_9480 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are chronic and often progressive myeloid neoplasms associated with remarkable heterogeneity in the histomorphology and clinical course.
Test_Line_9481 Clinical parameters studied included age, gender, overall survival (OS), and blood counts.
Test_Line_9482 HCT may be warranted in intermediate-2-risk or high-risk patients in which median survival is expected to be <5 years.
Test_Line_9483 DNMT3A also forms complexes with DNMT3L, a DNMT family member that lacks a methyltransferase catalytic domain; formation of the DNMT3A-DNMT3L complex results in increased DNMT3A activity.
Test_Line_9484 In the last year, genes in the cohesin complex have been described as novel mutations occurring in 13% of AML patients, suggesting that the cohesin-complex presents an important pathway in the pathogenesis of AML.
Test_Line_9485 To address these issues from the laboratory perspective, here we present practice guidelines for JAK2 and MPL mutation testing and reporting.
Test_Line_9486 Patients with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL were studied for CALR exon 9 mutations as reported in our original article or by Sanger sequencing, as described elsewhere.
Test_Line_9487 Several reports have described the clinical impact of splicing factor mutations.
Test_Line_9488 Figure 3. Proportions of Patients with Mutations, According to Platelet Count, Blast Percentage, and Hemoglobin Level. Data are shown for the platelet count (Panel A), percentage of blasts in bone marrow aspirate (Panel B), and hemoglobin level (Panel C) at the time of bone marrow sample collection. The numbers in parentheses along the x axis indicate the number of patients with a mutation in the gene (patients could have >1 mutated gene). Mutations in NRAS, TP53, and RUNX1 were significantly associated with severe thrombocytopenia (defined as <50,000 platelets per cubic millimeter) (P<0.001 for each comparison) (Panel A) and elevated blast percentage (defined as >=5%) (P<0.001, P = 0.005, and P = 0.003 for mutations in the three genes, respectively) (Panel B).
Test_Line_9489 These neutropenias may be isolated or associated with immunologic defects or extra-hematopoietic manifestations.
Test_Line_9490 In exploring the effects of cohesin downmodulation/mutations on expression pattern in cohort, we noted a consistent down-modulation of DCK in patients with cohesin complex alterations.
Test_Line_9491 Relative contribution of JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status to OS as predicted by IPSS or DIPSS.
Test_Line_9492 The guidelines provide a list of several commonly used salvage regimens (see page 998).
Test_Line_9493 Allele heterozygosity is more common in ET compared with homozygosity in PV and PMF, which is thought to result from mitotic recombination.
Test_Line_9494 Because there was incomplete concordance, it is important that laboratories participate in proficiency testing programs that include a wide spectrum of clinical laboratories.
Test_Line_9495 Also, U2AF35 mutations were associated with poor prognosis or higher risk of progression to AML in univariate analysis in some series but not in others.
Test_Line_9496 The selection criteria were the absence of mutations for the major genes involved in congenital neutropenia (ELANE, CXCR4, SBDS, HAX1, and G6PC3; n = 288 patients) and the presence of clinical features associated with GATA2 mutations: leg lymphedema, warts, and evolution to MDS/AML.
Test_Line_9497 Sequences were analyzed with Sequencher (Genescode).
Test_Line_9498 In the latter study from the UK MRC, the 5-year OS rate among patients with and without FLT3-TKD mutations was 53% versus 37%, respectively.
Test_Line_9499 This is most prominent for the association of SF3B1 mutations with increased ring sideroblasts.
Test_Line_9500 In the past four decades, cytogenetic and candidate-gene studies have identified recurrent somatic alterations in patients with myeloid malignancies, including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).
Test_Line_9501 The population of HSCs that is capable of both self-renewal and the production of short-term haematopoietic stem or progenitor cells.
Test_Line_9502 A total of 3 mug of DNA extracted from the BM sample of patient number 6225 (blast infiltration, 30%) was fragmented by sonication to 150-200 bp and ligated to an oligonucleotide adaptor.
Test_Line_9503 The reduction in spleen volume was durable with continued therapy (Fig. 1C).
Test_Line_9504 The Y252H mutation, which is located in the extracellular domain of MPL, confers hypersensitivity to thrombopoietin and increases the generation of megakaryocyte colonies in vitro and leads to increased thrombopoietin signaling and cell growth and survival.
Test_Line_9505 Sequence Analysis.
Test_Line_9506 Hematologic abnormalities are based on laboratory values. The data shown are for events of the worst grade during the study, regardless of whether this grade was a change from the baseline grade.
Test_Line_9507 Although studies in the Swedish Leukemia Registry documented improvement in outcomes for patients younger than 60 years over the past 3 decades, no similar improvement was observed for the older population.
Test_Line_9508 This study suggests that 2 cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine (1 g/m2 every 12 hours x 6 days; total dose 12 g/m2 per cycle) for each consolidation cycle may be a feasible alternative to the current NCCN recommendations of 3 cycles of high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 for 6 doses; total dose of 18 g/m2 per cycle).
Test_Line_9509 This probably relates to the partially non-overlapping roles of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B, and suggests a possible unique role for DNMT3A in haematopoiesis.
Test_Line_9510 To determine the functional effect of spliceosomal mutations, we evaluated pre-mRNA splicing profiles by RNA deep sequencing.
Test_Line_9511 In addition to regulating normal neutrophil homeostasis, G-CSF levels rapidly increase during infection, resulting in elevated levels of neutrophils as a component of the immune response.
Test_Line_9512 Cytogenetics and SNP-A analyses.
Test_Line_9513 The color-space reads were aligned with NovoalignCS and genotyped with GATK's Unified Genotyper.
Test_Line_9514 Five SNVs were identified further and confirmed by classic Sanger sequencing: EPHB6 T483P, GATA2 R396Q, IMPG2 P1161L, NEK11 D87Y, and TTN P4737R.
Test_Line_9515 The occurrence of subclonal driver mutations might be closely related to the early initiating genetic lesions, as recently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_9516 Mutations occurred throughout the genes without the presence of a mutational hotspot.
Test_Line_9517 Because most laboratories offer V617F and exon 12 mutations as separate tests, exon 12 mutation may be mistakenly requested as the initial screening test instead of V617F mutation.
Test_Line_9518 After interruption of ruxolitinib therapy, myelofibrosis-related symptoms gradually returned to baseline levels.
Test_Line_9519 Preanalytic components should include the tissue source (eg, peripheral blood, bone marrow, paraffin-embedded tissue) and, if available, the clinical indication for testing.
Test_Line_9520 cDNA was fragmented with Covaris, profiled with Agilent Bioanalyzer, and subjected to Illumina library preparation with NEBNext reagents (New England Biolabs).
Test_Line_9521 For patients who are deemed unfit for standard induction or intermediate-intensity therapy such as clofarabine, recent options have focused on epigenetic agents, including hypomethylating drugs such as 5-azacytadine and decitabine, alone or in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors.
Test_Line_9522 In the 2008 WHO classification, the category of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities was expanded to include the following: t(9;11)(p22;q23), t(6;9) (p23;q34) (provisional entity), inv(3)(q21;q26.2) or inv(3;3)(q21;q26.2) (provisional entity), and t(1;22)(p13;q13) (provisional entity), in addition to the previously recognized t(8;21)(q22;q22); inv(16) (p13;1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); and t(15;17) (q22;q12) [APL subtype].
Test_Line_9523 Normal cytogenetics were present in 48% of mutant cases, whereas 10% had complex cytogenetics, a distribution comparable to WT patients.
Test_Line_9524 An understanding of the clinical effects of mutations in various genes could improve the prediction of prognosis for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and inform the selection of specific therapies.
Test_Line_9525 P, P value from univariate or multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.
Test_Line_9526 Therefore, in order to elucidate the role of PTEN/MMAC1 in leukemogenesis, 62 AML cases, 5 hemopoietic cell lines, and 30 normal controls were studied.
Test_Line_9527 Another conspicuous feature of splicing factor mutations is the presence of mutational hot spots in major mutational targets, including SF3B1, SRSF2 and U2AF35.
Test_Line_9528 We identified a heterozygous nonsense GATA2 E224X mutation (c.670G > T, supplemental Figure 1) that was not detected in the parents' samples.
Test_Line_9529 Recently, other common molecular lesions with prognostic impact have been identified in patients with AML.
Test_Line_9530 In MDS/MPN, SRSF2 mutations were more common than U2AF1; however, U2AF1 mutations were associated with shorter survival (Figure 2B).
Test_Line_9531 Although these findings reveal novel insights into noncanonical functions of JAK2, many questions remain.
Test_Line_9532 In a CALGB trial, the subgroup of patients aged 60 years or younger (n = 156) who received standard-dose cytarabine-daunorubicin induction therapy and 4 courses of high-dose cytarabine consolidation (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5, per course) experienced a 4-year DFS rate of 44%.
Test_Line_9533 Ley and colleagues first identified somatic mutation of DNMT3A in adults with AML after whole-genome sequencing of a human sample of AML with normal cytogenetics.
Test_Line_9534 For patients younger than 50 years who received high-dose cytarabine at the 3-g/m2 dose schedule for induction, the rates of treatment-related deaths (10% vs. 5%) and grade 3 or greater neurologic toxicity (16% vs. 2%) were higher than for those who received the standard dose.
Test_Line_9535 The molecular pathogenesis of cancers including leukemias involves a stepwise accumulation of mutations affecting both cellular oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
Test_Line_9536 Investigation Drug Therapy.
Test_Line_9537 Bone-marrow-aspirate mononuclear cells and buccal-swab samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes were obtained from Rush University Medical Center, the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Test_Line_9538 Estimates for general mutation detection indicate that approximately 1000-fold coverage is needed for a given base to achieve a 99% confidence of detecting more than 5% heterozygous mutant alleles.
Test_Line_9539 Assays with adequate analytic sensitivity are required for the sensitive detection of JAK2 V617F, because the mutation may be present in a small fraction of the neoplastic clonal cell population.
Test_Line_9540 Accounting for them is not only relevant to clinical decision-making, but should also be considered in designing clinical trials.
Test_Line_9541 This discovery represents a significant advance in the field of MDS research, providing a novel clue to understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS.
Test_Line_9542 Because of the strong association between NPM1 mutations and genes in the cohesin complex, we wanted to find out whether the cohesin mutations have an impact in the NPM1-mutated patient group.
Test_Line_9543 The decision to use high- versus standard-dose cytarabine for induction might be influenced by consolidation strategies; fewer high-dose consolidation cycles may be needed for patients induced with high-dose cytarabine or for those who will undergo early autologous HSCT.
Test_Line_9544 An additional patient had a silent mutation (Ile87Ile).
Test_Line_9545 Clinicohematological characteristics and outcome of patients with CMML and RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_9546 In this subgroup, we did not identify a difference in OS and RFS for patients with or without mutations in the cohesin complex (OS: HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.34-1.57; P = .42) and (RFS: HR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.19-1.16; P = .1; supplemental Figure 3A-B).
Test_Line_9547 Two missense point mutations in the middle of RHD (Arg80Cys and Arg139Gly) were described earlier.
Test_Line_9548 The postanalytic components include interpretive comments, if needed.
Test_Line_9549 An estimated 13780 people will be diagnosed with AML in 2012, and 10200 patients will die of the disease.
Test_Line_9550 Table 4. Risk Stratification and Treatment in Polycythemia Vera.
Test_Line_9551 Death occurred in 176 patients (28.5%), including 115 of 399 patients with JAK2 (V617F) (29%), 27 of 140 with a CALR exon 9 indel (19%), 10 of 25 (40%) with an MPL (W515) mutation, and 24 of 53 triple-negative patients (45%).
Test_Line_9552 Radiotherapy, especially in the context of myeloablative therapy (eg, total-body irradiation or radioimmunotherapy) given before autologous stem cell transplantation, may also increase the risk of therapy-related MDS/AML.
Test_Line_9553 For samples harboring multiple mutations, cloning analysis was carried out to clarify whether the mutations were on the same allele or on different alleles.
Test_Line_9554 This is evident from genomic studies on patient samples of myeloid malignancies, as well as of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), in which mutations in PRC2 components are more frequent than in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9555 Details of the treatment protocols have been previously reported.
Test_Line_9556 An additional three patients had identical nonsense mutations at the transactivating domain (Arg293).
Test_Line_9557 We assigned each factor an integer weight according to the corresponding HR in the multivariable-Cox regression (Table 2): weight 1 for presence of constitutional symptoms, peripheral blood blasts >=1%, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, and presence of JAK2 mutation; weight 2 for MPL mutation or nonmutated JAK2, CALR, and MPL, WBC count >25 x 109/L, and age >65 years.
Test_Line_9558 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Test_Line_9559 Both azacytidine and decitabine are approved by the FDA as treatment for patients with MDS.
Test_Line_9560 However, changes in methylation were not correlated with robust changes in gene expression.
Test_Line_9561 However, we also noted reduced expression of cohesin genes in patients without mutations, including 15% of lower- and higher-risk MDS patients with reduced expression of STAG2 and RAD21.
Test_Line_9562 Fusion genes involving the PDGFb receptor gene at 5q33 are characterized by a distinct phenotype of CMML-eos.
Test_Line_9563 Only studies in which both IDH1 and IDH2 were sequenced are included. Mutational frequencies of ASXL1 are listed as reported in the original referenced manuscripts (this may include the controversial ASXL1 pGly646fsX12 variant (REF. 83)).
Test_Line_9564 Each laboratory was asked to provide three DNA specimens: one known to be JAK2 V617F positive, one weakly positive, and one from a patient suspected to have a MPN but that was found to be JAK2 V617F negative.
Test_Line_9565 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening for potential HSCT candidates is left to institutional policies regarding provision of CMV-negative blood products to patients who are CMV-negative at time of diagnosis.
Test_Line_9566 All the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol.
Test_Line_9567 Finally, BCOR mutations in AML were often associated with a decrease in BCOR mRNA levels, absence of full-length BCOR protein, and lack or low expression of a truncated BCOR protein.
Test_Line_9568 Most improvements in recent years have been in the treatment of patients with APL, which serves as a paradigm for understanding how the biology of the disease can inform treatment.
Test_Line_9569 Induction Therapy: Standard induction regimens are appropriate for patients younger than age 60 years.
Test_Line_9570 Again, if the patient's clinical condition has deteriorated to a point at which active therapy would be detrimental, best supportive care may be the most appropriate option.
Test_Line_9571 Conclusions.
Test_Line_9572 Additionally, this study expands the current knowledge of cohesin mutations across the spectrum of myeloid diseases, identifying cohesin mutation frequencies in different disease subtypes, most prominently in sAML (20%).
Test_Line_9573 Comparison among the 12 laboratories performing quantitative JAK2 V617F assays was complicated by the various ways in which the laboratories reported their results.
Test_Line_9574 Table 2. Adverse Events Observed in 10% or More of Patients Who Received Ruxolitinib.
Test_Line_9575 Patients with PMF may carry JAK2 (V617F), a CALR exon 9 indel, an MPL exon 10 mutation, or none of these genetic lesions.
Test_Line_9576 To get a better understanding of when mutations in the cohesin complex occur during clonal evolution, we evaluated the allelic burden of mutations in the cohesin complex.
Test_Line_9577 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related myeloid neoplasms are a heterogeneous group of intractable myeloid malignancies, characterized by deregulated blood cell production with dysplastic cell morphology and a high propensity to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Test_Line_9578 Treatment decisions for patients with significant reduction without hypoplasia or those with hypoplasia are deferred until the blood counts recover and a repeat marrow is performed to document remission status.
Test_Line_9579 To the best of our knowledge, mutations of RUNX1 have only been described in two patients with CMML.
Test_Line_9580 Studies have shown significantly decreased OS outcomes among patients with DNMT3A mutations compared with those with the wild-type gene (median OS, 12-21 vs. 40-41 months).
Test_Line_9581 We included the information as to SF3B1 mutation status of 39 cases reported in our previous study.
Test_Line_9582 MDS may occur de novo or arise years after exposure to mutagens (including radiation and some types of chemotherapy).
Test_Line_9583 Further, we performed cox multivariable analysis of myeloid malignancy subtypes and identified that presence of the STAG2 mutation predicted poor survival independent of age, sex, and IPSS scores in high- and low-risk MDS patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.5 [0.9, 2.6]; P = .11) and in patients with MDS who survived beyond 12 months (HR = 2.1 [1.1, 3.8]; P = .017; Figure 3).
Test_Line_9584 One study compared MDS and MPN with the corresponding secondary AMLs that had DNMT3A mutation and identified the same DNMT3A mutation in the antecedent disorder as in the secondary AML in all ten cases.
Test_Line_9585 SNV and indel discovery was performed across all samples using standard parameters and a maximum coverage of 10000.
Test_Line_9586 A high allele burden in PV and ET is associated with progression to myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_9587 Among the patients who received high-dose cytarabine consolidation, the 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 78% for CBF AML, 40% for normal karyotype, and 21% for other cytogenetic categories.
Test_Line_9588 Exploratory end points included changes in body weight and the JAK2V617F allele burden, achievement of independence from transfusions, and additional patient-reported outcomes (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9589 Our results indicate that the PTEN/MMAC1 gene may play a role in a small percentage of AML, but its significance needs to be further evaluated.
Test_Line_9590 In addition to RUNX1 and CEBPA, mutations in the telomerase RNA (TERC) or reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunits have also been identified.
Test_Line_9591 Under normal circumstances, the CSF3R ligand, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), promotes growth and survival of myeloid precursor cells, ultimately leading to differentiation of these myeloid precursors into neutrophils.
Test_Line_9592 Due to the strong association between NPM1 mutations and mutations in the cohesin complex, we studied the impact of cohesin mutations on OS and RFS in NPM1-mutated AML patients separately.
Test_Line_9593 One control had a deletion of nucleotides (nt) 1064 through 1814, the others had deletion of nt 1180-2142, nt 1244-1526, nt 1296-2013, and nt 1835-1877.
Test_Line_9594 Recent work suggests that ASXL1 mutations are bona fide loss-of-function mutations, and that ASXL1 loss results in loss of the transcriptionally repressive H3K27 trimethylation.
Test_Line_9595 MDS is a clonal hematopoietic disorder resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis and frequently evolving to AML.
Test_Line_9596 The presence of large hyperlobulated and mature-appearing megakaryocytes without erythroid or granulocyte proliferation is diagnostic for ET according to the WHO guidelines, but reliability may depend on skilled hematopathologists.
Test_Line_9597 The importance of cooperation with coexisting mutations and/or the effects of abnormal bone marrow environment represent possible explanations.
Test_Line_9598 Patients with SNP-A lesions concordant with metaphase cytogenetics or typical lesions known to be recurrent required no further analysis.
Test_Line_9599 In our cases and in other cases reported with germline GATA2 mutations, no clear correlation between genotype and phenotype can be identified, suggesting that these clinical presentations are a spectrum of the same disease.
Test_Line_9600 In all, 10 of 13 patients had cohesin present in the dominant clone after transformation (supplemental Tables 10-11).
Test_Line_9601 Figure 2. Schematic representation of MPL gene and mutation hot spots. Locations of reported mutations are indicated by colored triangles: red triangles for W515L and W515K, and black triangles for other SNP variant mutations. Representative codon numbers are marked above exon boxes. CP, cytoplasmic domain; DCR-NRD, distal cytokine receptor domain-negative regulatory domain; PCR-LBR, proximal cytokine receptor domain-ligand binding region; TM, transmembrane domain.
Test_Line_9602 The primers for all exons of the cohesin genes are listed in supplemental Table 1, available on the Blood Web site.
Test_Line_9603 Taken together, these data suggest that the classical twohit model of myeloid malignancy pathogenesis must be modified to account for novel classes of mutant disease alleles, most notably mutations in epigenetic modifiers.
Test_Line_9604 An accurate diagnosis is more likely when one or more of a JAK2V617F mutation, cytogenetic abnormalities (+9, del[13q]), anemia, elevated serum LDH, and leukoerythroblastosis are present.
Test_Line_9605 An assay that detects less than 0.1% of JAK2 allele, therefore, is more likely to produce false-positive results in the diagnostic setting.
Test_Line_9606 These data underscore the importance of aberrant epigenetic programming in the biology of myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9607 To elucidate the exact impacts of splicing factor mutations, a well-designed control study should be required taking other common mutations also into account.
Test_Line_9608 However, recent studies have demonstrated a novel role for JAK2 in epigenetic regulation.
Test_Line_9609 The Patient Global Impression of Change and other patient-reported outcomes mirrored changes in symptom scores (Fig.
Test_Line_9610 Conclusions.
Test_Line_9611 Patients.
Test_Line_9612 Because complete remission rates rarely exceed 70% in younger patients and 50% in older patients, substantial opportunity exists for innovative clinical trials involving both patient populations.
Test_Line_9613 The only relevant observation was the higher frequency of CALR type 1 mutation in PMF compared with ET, which may suggest a particularly active role of the 52-bp deletion in causing bone marrow fibrosis.
Test_Line_9614 In fact, when comparing JAK2-mutant and CALR-mutant patients, the subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) was 2.19 (95% CI, 1.15-4.18, P = .017), indicating that the risk of thrombosis was about twofold in the former.
Test_Line_9615 Tissue typing should be broadened to include unrelated donor searches in patients younger than 60 years with karyotypes or molecular abnormalities deemed highrisk.
Test_Line_9616 A CNL patient with the CSF3R T618I membrane proximal mutation was treated with ruxolitinib and exhibited a marked, durable decrease in white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts and resolution of thrombocytopenia (initially reported as a 5-month response, now still responding after 11 months).
Test_Line_9617 Most of these methods typically do not achieve sensitivities of less than 5% of alleles (Table 4).
Test_Line_9618 A matched unrelated donor search (including cord blood) should be initiated for high-risk patients who would be candidates for HSCT in first CR, or considered at first relapse in appropriate patients concomitant with initiation of reinduction therapy.
Test_Line_9619 These patients should be considered for a clinical trial, allogeneic HSCT with matched sibling or matched unrelated donor, or best supportive care.
Test_Line_9620 For this study, we considered complete remission, partial remission, and hematologic improvement in any cell lineage as response and stable disease, death, progression, or relapse during therapy as nonresponse.
Test_Line_9621 Mutations in ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, CBL, IKAROS, and LNK genes have all been described with variable frequencies in MPN.
Test_Line_9622 SRSF2 mutations were reported to be associated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis, but may not be an independent prognostic predictor.
Test_Line_9623 Besides alterations in TET2, CBL, ASXL1 and the RAS pathway, EZH2 is targeted by various types of frameshift and point mutations.
Test_Line_9624 Moreover, knockdown of Asxl1 using shRNA in vivo in a mouse model of haematopoietic NrasG12D overexpression resulted in accelerated disease latency and increased disease burden in vivo, with concomitant loss of Asxl1 (REF. 86).
Test_Line_9625 As shown recently by us and by others, the clinical course of MPNs is profoundly influenced not only by the founding driver mutations but also by subclonal events.
Test_Line_9626 Organelles that are found in virtually all eukaryotic cells. They are involved in the catabolism of very-long-chain fatty acids, branchedchain fatty acids, d-amino acids, polyamines and the biosynthesis of plasmalogens and etherphospholipids.
Test_Line_9627 In this cross-sectional analysis of the cohesin mutant cohort, STAG2 and SMC3 mutant clones were ancestral in only 18% of the cases.
Test_Line_9628 Methylation of CpG islands and 'shores' within promoter regions leads to transcriptional silencing through binding of methyl-DNA-binding proteins and chromatin modifying enzymes.
Test_Line_9629 Although we may understand the specific activity of an individual gene and/or have derived general models of how epigenetic modifications affect transcription, we do not yet have a grasp of the crucial components that are altered by these epigenetic mutations and how this affects epigenetic patterning, gene expression and phenotypic alterations in haematopoietic cells.
Test_Line_9630 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_9631 Of note, no case revealed the Tyr641 mutation as described in follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of germinal center origin suggesting a different oncogenic mechanism in these diseases.
Test_Line_9632 Thrombotic complications occurred in 76 of 617 patients (12%) with PMF.
Test_Line_9633 One patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) has been reported to carry the 45,-Y,t(X;17)(p11;q12) karyotype, leading to the formation of a BCOR-RAR alpha fusion gene.
Test_Line_9634 RESULTS.
Test_Line_9635 Clinically, patients with exon 12 mutations typically present with isolated erythrocytosis and suppressed erythropoietin, in contrast to the trilineage hyperplasia characteristic of patients with V617F mutation.
Test_Line_9636 On the basis of the initial screen, we noted that mutations in U2AF1, SF3B1, and SRSF2 were the most frequent.
Test_Line_9637 As of writing, there were no kits cleared by the FDA for clinical use in testing for JAK2 or MPL mutations; however, it is possible that a companion diagnostic for the JAK2 V617F mutation will be developed to detect the JAK2 mutation and to quantify the response to targeted therapies.
Test_Line_9638 Recent studies have shown that the placement of 5-hmC leads to active demethylation through the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)-APOBEC DNA repair pathway (FIG. 1).
Test_Line_9639 Immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA followed by hybridization to DNA microarray chips (MeDIP-chip) revealed that AMLs with DNMT3AR882 mutations had decreased methylation at 182 specific genomic loci compared with DNMT3A-wild-type AML.
Test_Line_9640 In U2AF35, the mutations almost exclusively involved highly conserved two amino acid positions, S34 and Q157, within the N- and C-terminal zinc finger domains, while almost all SRSF2 mutations are missense changes at P95 or deletions involving this amino acid position.
Test_Line_9641 In the Italian report, transformation to acute leukemia occurred in 22 patients (40%), with a median time from diagnosis of 18 months.
Test_Line_9642 Some published methods screen for mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or high-resolution melting-curve analysis, followed by direct sequencing to confirm that a mutation is present.
Test_Line_9643 Thus JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of PRMT5 and histone H3-Y41 can lead to direct alterations in epigenetic patterning.
Test_Line_9644 We analyzed RNA sequencing results in patients with mutations in U2AF1 (n = 3), SRSF2 (n = 2), SF3B1 (n = 2), and U2AF26 (n = 1), as well as in a healthy control and 1 patients with MDS with a WT configuration of these genes.
Test_Line_9645 cytometry.
Test_Line_9646 Other alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases include enzymes involved in hypoxia sensing, collagen biosynthesis, lipid biosynthesis and DNA and RNA demethylation.
Test_Line_9647 There were no significant differences between the two groups with the exception of age (P<0.05). IPSS denotes International Prognostic Scoring System.
Test_Line_9648 The median time to AML progression was 6.8 months in patients with C-terminal mutations compared with 28.3 months in those without mutations (P = 0.022).
Test_Line_9649 The libraries were then submitted for Illumina HiSeq2000 sequencing according to standard procedures.
Test_Line_9650 The incidence of relapse was 47% and 35%, respectively, and the incidence of deaths in CRs was 5% and 20%, respectively.
Test_Line_9651 Equivalent antithrombotic efficacy with low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day) has now been demonstrated and is currently recommended for all patients diagnosed with PV regardless of risk profile and in the absence of contraindications.
Test_Line_9652 Initial studies of the role of DNMT3A in mouse haematopoiesis demonstrated no overt phenotype unless both Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were lost.

Test_Line_9654 After crossover, data for patients who were initially assigned to placebo were not included in the analyses, except for the intention-to-treat analysis of overall survival.
Test_Line_9655 Patients who require 2 cycles of chemotherapy to achieve a remission are likely to have more resistant disease and should be considered for a more intensive approach as initial consolidation whenever possible.
Test_Line_9656 Abbreviations: AVWS = acute von Willebrand syndrome; ET = essential thrombocythemia; Hct = hematocrit.
Test_Line_9657 Screening for JAK2V617F may help increase clinical suspicion of MPN and may be diagnostic in PV, and eliminate the need for bone marrow biopsy (Figure 2).
Test_Line_9658 Further work in mice and humans is needed for the identification and functional validation of collaborating genetic events that cooperate with TET2 mutations in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9659 Emberger syndrome is an autosomal-dominant primary lymphedema with a predisposition to AML.
Test_Line_9660 Samples were acquired from adult patients, who provided written informed consent, between 1994 and 2008 according to protocols approved by the institutional review board at each institution.
Test_Line_9661 In recent years, a number of somatic mutations have been associated with various myeloid malignancies, including MDS.
Test_Line_9662 To distinguish the independent contributions of mutations to the clinical phenotype and overall survival, we examined a large set of samples obtained from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes for the presence of somatic mutations in a broad spectrum of cancer-associated genes.
Test_Line_9663 Somatic cohesin mutations have been reported in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Test_Line_9664 In a multivariate analysis corrected for age, CALR-mutant patients maintained a better OS compared with either JAK2-mutant (P = .019) or triple-negative patients (P <.001).
Test_Line_9665 The IPSS risk (low, intermediate 1, intermediate 2, or high) (Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix) had been ascertained at the time of diagnosis.
Test_Line_9666 A heterogeneous group of malignant haematopoietic disorders that are characterized by dysplastic and ineffective blood cell production and a variable risk of transformation to acute leukaemia.
Test_Line_9667 Analysis of DNA from CD3+ cells showed a much lower frequency of the base change (2 of 15 reads), highlighting the somatic nature of this alteration.
Test_Line_9668 Although allele burden has been shown to decrease after use of some inhibitors, there is no one-to-one correlation of allele burden with clinical response (eg, reduction in splenomegaly).
Test_Line_9669 Mechanistically, partial loss of DNMT3A activity is thought to lead to hypomethylation, but which methylated loci are altered and directly contribute to leukaemogenesis in DNMT3A-mutant or DNMT3A-haploinsufficient cells has not yet been delineated.
Test_Line_9670 An interesting finding was the strong association between NPM1 mutations and the mutations in cohesin genes, as already indicated in the recent report of the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network.
Test_Line_9671 Taken together, these data suggest that cohesin function is integral to expression of key cell-identity genes and that reduction in gene dose of cohesin alters cellular identity.
Test_Line_9672 Based on the protocol-specified final analysis of the primary end point (OS), decitabine was associated with a statistically nonsignificant trend for increased median OS compared with physician's choice (7.7 vs. 5 months; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.69-1.04; P = .10).
Test_Line_9673 Therefore, G-CSFs or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors should be discontinued for a minimum of 7 days before bone marrow samples are assessed when documenting remission status.
Test_Line_9674 We also screened for homozygous deletion at PTEN/MMAC1 gene by PCR amplification of all exons, but no homozygous deletion was observed in any of the AML cases or 5 cell lines.
Test_Line_9675 Disclosures for the NCCN Acute Myeloid Leukemia Panel At the beginning of each NCCN Guidelines panel meeting, panel members review all potential conflicts of interest.
Test_Line_9676 The second most frequently mutated genes in the cohesin complex were SMC3 and STAG2, and we found 5 patients with these mutations, respectively.
Test_Line_9677 In particular, 11/21 alterations were observed in this CMML cohort.
Test_Line_9678 It is found in only 3% of patients with de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and is not seen in nonmyeloid malignancies or reactive myeloproliferation.
Test_Line_9679 In this study, we analyzed the frequency, clinical, and prognostic implications of mutations in STAG1, STAG2, SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21, all members of the cohesin complex, in a cohort of 389 uniformly treated AML patients by next generation sequencing.
Test_Line_9680 In contrast, FLT3-TKD may be associated with an additional favorable prognosis in the presence of NPM1 or CEBPA mutations.
Test_Line_9681 When phosphorylated, this mutational hotspot is bound by the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit b-TrCP1, leading to ubiquitination of SETBP1 and subsequent degradation.
Test_Line_9682 DIAGNOSIS.
Test_Line_9683 RESULTS.
Test_Line_9684 Diagnosis.
Test_Line_9685 When Should JAK2 and MPL Mutational Analysis Be Performed?
Test_Line_9686 The EZH2 homologue EZH1 also has similar enzymatic activity, and the redundancy of these two proteins in controlling PRC2 functionality probably differs according to cellular context.
Test_Line_9687 Fig. 3. (A) SSCP analysis of PTEN/MMAC1 exon 5. Altered mobility band (arrowhead) present in PCR products amplified from the leukemia cell line U937 DNA is seen in lane 3. (B) The result of sequencing of the altered band shows a 4-bp (CCCG) insertion at nucleotide 1423.
Test_Line_9688 RESULTS.
Test_Line_9689 IDENTIFICATION OF NEW SOMATIC MUTATIONS.
Test_Line_9690 These sites regulate the expression of specific genes that govern physiological cell identity and pluripotency/self-renewal in malignancy and in embryonic stem cells.
Test_Line_9691 New genetic findings in CNL and aCML.
Test_Line_9692 Importantly, cohesin genes can also affect transcription independently of CCCTC-binding factor.
Test_Line_9693 SETBP1 protects SET from protease cleavage, thus increasing the amount of SET available to repress the activity of PP2A.
Test_Line_9694 RT-PCR and cDNA Sequencing.
Test_Line_9695 Even among the subgroup with favorable karyotypes, those with therapy-related AML tend to do less well.
Test_Line_9696 Undoubtedly, cell division is one of the key processes for every tumor cell including AML blasts due to the increased proliferation potential of malignant cells.
Test_Line_9697 PCR products were separated by electrophoresis at 70 W for 2 hr in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed for 6-18 hr.
Test_Line_9698 These findings strengthened the importance of deregulated epigenetic modifiers in myeloid malignancy pathogenesis which had already been suggested by the finding of recurrent translocations involving histone lysine acetyltransferases (for example, lysine acetyltransferase 6A (KAT6A; also known as MOZ)-nuclear receptor co-activator 2 (NCOA2; also known as TIF2) fusion) and methyltransferases (for example, nucleoporin 98 (NUP98)-nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) fusion and mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) translocations).
Test_Line_9699 Idarubicin, which has a longer intracellular retention time, used at doses of 12 mg/m2 x 3 days, has had comparable remission rates with fewer patients requiring additional therapy at day 15 to achieve remission.
Test_Line_9700 Patients who received ruxolitinib had weight gain, whereas those receiving placebo had weight loss (Fig.
Test_Line_9701 Conclusive evidence associating specific aberrant epigenetic profiles and somatic mutations with targeted therapy or with predictive value for standard therapy is lacking for the majority of cases.
Test_Line_9702 White blood cells can be obtained by simply performing a red blood cell lysis procedure.
Test_Line_9703 JH2, which resides upstream to JH1, is structurally similar to JH1 but functions as a pseudokinase domain that negatively regulates basal activity of the kinase domain and receptor-induced activation of the catalytic function.
Test_Line_9704 Mutations in other exons include V501A, Y252H, and S204P (Figure 2).
Test_Line_9705 We subsequently screened a large cohort of patients (n = 310) with MDS and related disorders (including the initially screened 120 cases) in a stepwise fashion to determine the frequency of spliceosomal mutations discovered in the index cases.
Test_Line_9706 For U2AF1 and U2AF26 we found that accumulation of unspliced transcripts rather than abnormal alternative splicing is the main consequence of the mutations.
Test_Line_9707 We and other groups recently identified a variety of new mutations present at distinct frequencies in subgroups of patients with MDS.
Test_Line_9708 Further work to study the in vivo effects of conditional PRC2 loss or overexpression is crucial to advance our understanding of PRC2 function in HSCs and in myeloid leukaemogenesis.
Test_Line_9709 When expressed in HeLa cells, the S34F U2AF35 allele induces global defects of splicing, causing abnormal retention of intronic sequences in a wide variety of mature mRNA species.
Test_Line_9710 There is increasing evidence implicating the Polycomb-repressive deubiquitylase (PR-DUB) complex, which functions to deubiquitylate H2AK119, in a range of human malignancies.
Test_Line_9711 Karyotypes were established from bone marrow (BM) aspiration using standard procedures and described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.
Test_Line_9712 Clinical Effect of Point Mutations in Myelodysplastic Syndromes.
Test_Line_9713 Most recently, the creation of a conditional Idh1R132H knock-in mouse model reinforced the effect of IDH mutations on increasing the population of haematopoietic stem or progenitor cells and DNA cytosine and histone lysine methylation.
Test_Line_9714 Most patients who received ruxolitinib had improvement in symptoms; the majority of patients who received placebo had worsening of symptoms (Fig. 2B).
Test_Line_9715 The participating laboratories tested the samples using a combination of quantitative and qualitative assays for JAK2 mutations, and several of the laboratories also performed MPL mutation assays.
Test_Line_9716 The panel strongly recommends clinical trials as standard therapy for patients with poor prognostic features, which include FLT3 abnormalities in the setting of otherwise normal karyotype, high WBC (> 50,000/mcL) at diagnosis, or 2 cycles of induction therapy needed to achieve CR.
Test_Line_9717 Identification of a germline GATA2 R396Q mutation in pedigree 1.
Test_Line_9718 Risk stratification in PV and ET is based on thrombotic risk, and survival in PMF is estimated by the International Prognostic Scoring System.
Test_Line_9719 In addition to the 23 somatic mutations, we identified 3 SNPs (2 in STAG1 and 1 in RAD21), which have not been described by dbSNP and were not found in mononuclear cells of 30 healthy donors.
Test_Line_9720 The corepressors BCOR and BCORL1: two novel players in acute myeloid leukemia.
Test_Line_9721 Whole-exome sequencing and targeted multiamplicon deep sequencing.
Test_Line_9722 Recently, we identified high-frequency oncogenic mutations in the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (CSF3R) in CNL and in some patients with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia.
Test_Line_9723 In addition to the known cytogenetic abnormalities, we identified a single case with a focal deletion encompassing ETV6, a gene that is recurrently involved in translocations in acute leukemia but is not known to be mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (Fig. 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9724 Both disease-specific and individual patient factors are taken into consideration when deciding treatment.
Test_Line_9725 The low frequencies of RUNX1 mutations in the earlier studies were probably attributed to different patient populations along with the limited exons analyzed as well as the small number of CMML patients examined.
Test_Line_9726 Candidate mutations detected in whole-genome--amplified DNA were validated with the use of nonamplified DNA (see the Methods section, Table 4, and Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9727 Mutations in DNMT3A have also been observed in patients with MDS, as well as less commonly in patients with classic MPNs (BOX 1; TABLE 1).
Test_Line_9728 Recently, several groups reported frequent mutations of multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery in MDS and related disorders.
Test_Line_9729 IDH1 and IDH2 catalyse an essential step in the Krebs cycle that converts isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate in an NADP+-dependent manner.
Test_Line_9730 Recently, mutations in a gene encoding a spliceosomal protein, SF3B1, were discovered in a distinct form of MDS with ring sideroblasts.
Test_Line_9731 The amino terminus of DNMT3A contains both PWWP and ADD domains that recognize histone H3 lysine modifications and recruit the protein to specific gene targets (reviewed in REF. 19).
Test_Line_9732 Prespecified analyses were conducted to cross-validate the modified MFSAF, version 2.0.
Test_Line_9733 Whole exome sequencing has revealed the otherwise unexpected involvement of multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery by gene mutations that characterize MDS and related myeloid neoplasms and as such, demonstrated the power of massively parallel sequencing technologies in cancer research.
Test_Line_9734 Most TSG mutations are not canonical, though, making systematic clinical diagnostics more difficult.
Test_Line_9735 Microsatellite markers D10S215, D10S541, D10S579, and AFM086 displayed 10/20, 9/20, 12/20, and 8/20 heterozygosities, respectively. But none of 20 AML cases displayed LOH in these markers, suggesting that the regions defined by these markers had both alleles intact in these cases.
Test_Line_9736 Notably, in each model published to date, there was a considerable latency before mice developed overt myeloid leukaemias, which suggests that secondary events are required for specific disease phenotypes.
Test_Line_9737 Leptomeningeal involvement is much less frequent (< 3%) in patients with AML than in those with ALL; therefore, the panel does not recommend LP as part of the routine diagnostic workup.
Test_Line_9738 A number of AML cell lines are positive for JAK2 V617F, including HEL, MB-02, MUTZ-8, SET-2, UKE-1.
Test_Line_9739 Mutational analysis of the entire 9 coding exons showed that only one cell line (U937) had a frameshift mutation resulting in premature termination of the PTEN/MMAC1 protein.
Test_Line_9740 The adjusted VAF of STAG2, RAD21, and SMC3 mutations were significantly lower than those for other concomitantly present TET2 gene mutations (P = .01).
Test_Line_9741 Complications may occur as infectious diseases, but also less frequently as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Test_Line_9742 Over the last decade, genetic alterations in patients with MDS/CMML have been a subject of investigations.
Test_Line_9743 Treatment-related mortality at 100 days was 18%, 19%, and 35% respectively.
Test_Line_9744 These effects are thought to be secondary to the inhibition of active DNA methylation.
Test_Line_9745 In 2007, additional mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 gene were found in a small percentage of PV patients.
Test_Line_9746 The monocytopenia, together with the infectious spectrum composed by pyogenic or mycobacteria infections and HPV-related warts, have some similarities to the MonoMAC syndrome.
Test_Line_9747 However, what importance amsacrine may have served in the outcomes of the HOVON/SAKK study is currently not known.
Test_Line_9748 Finally, we used the Akaike information criterion as a measure of the relative quality of the clinical-molecular prognostic model compared with the IPSS.
Test_Line_9749 Thus, as the population ages, the incidence of AML, along with myelodysplasia, seems to be rising.
Test_Line_9750 Interestingly, in this latter study, non-R882 DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with poorer outcomes in patients younger than 60 years (but not R882 mutations); in contrast, in patients aged 60 years and older, DNMT3A-R882 mutations (but not non-R882 mutations) were associated with significantly decreased DFS (3-year rate, 3% vs. 21%; P = .006) and OS (3-year rate, 4% vs. 24%; P = .01).
Test_Line_9751 Therapy-related myeloid leukemia (secondary MDS/AML) is a well-recognized consequence of cancer treatment in a proportion of patients receiving cytotoxic therapy for solid tumors or hematologic malignancies.
Test_Line_9752 U2AF1 and SRSF2 are frequently mutated in high-risk MDS and CMML whereby RUNX1 mutations are relevant, which explains our theory that spliceosomal mutations results in similar phenotype to the corresponding loss-of-function mutations.
Test_Line_9753 Homozygous deletion of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene has also been reported in some tumor cell lines.
Test_Line_9754 Eight of the 33 TP53 mutant samples (24.2%) had abnormalities of chromosome 17 (P<0.001), suggesting that mutation and chromosomal loss are frequently found together, abrogating the activity of wildtype TP53.
Test_Line_9755 Granulocyte JAK2 (V617F) mutation status and mutant allele burden were assessed using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based allelic discrimination assay on a Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time analyzer (Qiagen), as previously described.
Test_Line_9756 In 2 cases of sAML that evolved from RAEB, cohesin mutations were observed only after transformation to AML (Figure 4A-B), indicating these mutations can occur as a late event that is associated with AML transformation.
Test_Line_9757 The 10-year cumulative incidence of thrombosis was 18.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.3-24.1) in patients carrying JAK2 (V617F), 13.6% (95% CI, 6.9-22.7) in those with CALR mutation, 17.9% (95% CI, 4.1-39.6) in those with MPL mutation, and 16.2% (95% CI, 6.3-30.1) in triple-negative subjects (Figure 2).
Test_Line_9758 HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR assay (HELP assay).
Test_Line_9759 Interestingly, the latter genotype mimicked that of the AML index patient initially used for whole-exome sequencing.
Test_Line_9760 The intersection of ASXL1-bound genomic regions - as identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) - and gene expression profiling resulted in the identification of specific targets of ASXL1, including the HOXA cluster of genes, the expression of which increases with ASXL1 loss or mutation.
Test_Line_9761 All P values were considered statistically significant when <.05 (2-tailed).
Test_Line_9762 Because of the strong association between NPM1 and cohesin mutations, the allelic ratio of mutated and wild-type NPM1 was compared with the allelic ratio of mutated and wild-type cohesin genes.
Test_Line_9763 MASS-SPECTROMETRIC GENOTYPING.
Test_Line_9764 The 2 well-documented categories of cytotoxic agents associated with the development of therapy-related MDS/AML are alkylating agents (eg, cyclophosphamide, melphalan) and topoisomerase inhibitors/agents that interact with topoisomerase (eg, etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone).
Test_Line_9765 Mutations of GATA2 described previously are highly heterogeneous (supplemental Table 3), ranging from the creation of a stop codon (R337X), a frameshift mutation scattered over the whole coding frame (R78, G81, L105, A194, G200, D259, N317, L332 and A341), deletions (ranging from large deletions encompassing the whole GATA2 locus to smaller deletions such as codons 1-290, codons 340-381, codons 341-346, and codons 362-365 or T355), and point mutations (located close to the second zinc finger domain with the exception of P254L: P304H, C319SC, T344M, T354M, L359V, R361L, R362Q, N371K, C373R, R396W, R396Q, and R398W).
Test_Line_9766 TET2 mutations can be observed as an early, probably disease-initiating event in patients with MPN, and can also be observed as a later disease event in patients with MPN whose disease transforms to AML (BOX 1).
Test_Line_9767 Based on studies with D. melanogaster homologues, ASXL1 is thought to associate with both repressive PcG and activating Trithorax complexes.
Test_Line_9768 In the HOVON trial, which randomized patients aged 60 years and older to induction therapy with standard-dose cytarabine combined with either standard-dose daunorubicin (45 mg/m2 x 3 days; n = 411) or dose-escalated daunorubicin (90 mg/m2 x 3 days; n = 402), the CR rate was 54% and 64%, respectively (P = .002).
Test_Line_9769 Moreover, these findings raise the question of whether other tyrosine and non-tyrosine kinases may localize to the nucleus and phosphorylate histones and other nuclear regulatory complexes.
Test_Line_9770 Somatic cohesin defects were detected in 12% of patients with myeloid malignancies, whereas low expression of these genes was present in an additional 15% of patients. Mutations of cohesin genes were mutually exclusive and mostly resulted in predicted loss of function.
Test_Line_9771 When the survival benefit of SF3B1 mutations was examined in patients with MDS with increased RS, the presence of SF3B1 mutations was associated with better OS and LFS in univariate analysis; however, significance was completely accounted for by the World Health Organization categorization for morphologic risk, and no additional prognostic value from the presence or absence of SF3B1 mutations was observed when RARS and RCMD-RS were analyzed separately.
Test_Line_9772 During our search for new molecular lesions associated with MDS, we identified somatic mutations affecting various components of the spliceosomal machinery, similar to previous reports.
Test_Line_9773 The abnormal transcripts may result from aberrant RNA splicing, as evidenced by the occurrence of aberrant transcripts in the AML specimens, cell lines, and normal controls, and the simultaneous presence of normal full length transcripts in all tumor samples and cell lines examined.
Test_Line_9774 Figure 2. Cooccurring somatic mutations in cohesin mutant patients. (A) Mutually exclusive cohesin gene mutations and cooccurring somatic genetic events. (B) Somatic mutational correlation in cohesin mutant/deletion cases.
Test_Line_9775 In the original study on the identification of calreticulin mutations in patients with ET or PMF, a multivariate Cox regression analysis of overall survival (OS) showed that patients with a CALR mutation had a lower risk of death than those with JAK2 (V617F) or an MPL mutation.
Test_Line_9776 Over the past decade a series of studies has implicated PRC1 activity in regulating HSC self-renewal and differentiation.
Test_Line_9777 The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for AML provide recommendations on the diagnostic evaluation and workup for AML, risk assessment based on cytogenetic and molecular features, treatment options for induction and consolidation therapies for younger and older (age >= 65 years) adult patients, and key supportive care considerations.
Test_Line_9778 No genome-wide increase in intron retention was observed in the patients with mutations.
Test_Line_9779 The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a reduction in spleen volume of 35% or more at 24 weeks, assessed by means of magnetic resonance imaging.
Test_Line_9780 The quality and quantity and the size distribution of the Illumina libraries were determined with an Agilent Bioanalyzer.
Test_Line_9781 RNA was reversely transcribed to cDNA with the superscript II RNase H2 reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Test_Line_9782 However, the spectrum of these mutations overlaps largely with that in AML, complicating the understanding of MDS-specific pathogenesis that discriminates MDS from AML.
Test_Line_9783 Functional studies are needed to investigate this and the potential effects of GATA2 mutations on dysfunction of the CXCR4 pathway, which account for the panleukopenia of WHIM patients.
Test_Line_9784 Chromosome 3 microsatellite genotyping.
Test_Line_9785 The proportion of patients with a reduction of 50% or more in the total symptom score from baseline to week 24, a prespecified secondary end point, was significantly higher in the ruxolitinib group than in the placebo group (45.9% vs. 5.3%; odds ratio, 15.3; 95% CI, 6.9 to 33.7; P<0.001).
Test_Line_9786 For whole-exome sequencing, the 50 Mb of protein coding sequences was enriched from total genomic DNA by liquid-phase hybridization using SureSelect (version 4) (Agilent Technology, Santa Clara, CA), followed by massively parallel sequencing with HiSequation 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA).
Test_Line_9787 Cytogenetic/molecular features.
Test_Line_9788 Intermediate-1-risk patients who have anemia should be treated with either erythropoietin stimulating agents, testosterone enanthate (400-600 mg intramuscularly/week), fluoxymesterone (10 mg orally, 3 times a day [t.id.]), prednisone (0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day), danazol (600 mg/day), thalidomide (50-200 mg/day), or lenalidomide (10 mg/day).
Test_Line_9789 Frameshift mutations were validated by cloning and sequencing individual colonies (TOPO TA cloning; Invitrogen).
Test_Line_9790 Serial samples were obtained for 38 patients.
Test_Line_9791 Currently, the interactions of both IDH1 or IDH2 and DNMT3 mutations with other molecular changes require further investigation to determine the prognostic value in patients with NK-AML.
Test_Line_9792 Some of these RNAs code for key proteins involved in malignant transformation.
Test_Line_9793 The risk of malignant transformation was extremely high, because 6 of 14 patients with GATA2 mutations developed a refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia and 4 patients developed AML (Figure 2B).
Test_Line_9794 Because a relatively small number of CN-AML cases has been analyzed for BCORL1 mutations and cases of s-AML have not been investigated for BCOR mutations, it is not yet clear whether or not mutations of these two homologous genes may occur in the same clinical-genetic AML backgrounds.
Test_Line_9795 We used 2 independent pipelines for identifying somatic and germline alterations.
Test_Line_9796 The CR rates were equivalent in both arms (71% and 74%, respectively), with significantly higher 5-year relapse-free survival rates with high-dose cytarabine (48% vs. 25%; P = .007).
Test_Line_9797 High-dose cytarabine therapy during induction was explored previously in 2 large cooperative group trials.
Test_Line_9798 If an HLA-matched sibling or matched unrelated donor has been identified, an allogeneic HSCT may salvage 25% to 30% of patients with induction failure.
Test_Line_9799 The HOVON/SAKK study compared a double-induction concept using intermediate- or high-dose cytarabine as part of an induction/consolidation regimen in a phase III randomized study in patients (age 18-60 years) with newly diagnosed AML (N = 860).
Test_Line_9800 Next, the analytic algorithm within DNAnexus called all the positions that vary from a reference genome.
Test_Line_9801 The NCCN AML Panel suggests that complementary diagnostic techniques can be used at the discretion of the pathology departments of the individual institutions.
Test_Line_9802 All exons of selected genes were amplified and underwent direct genomic sequencing by standard techniques on the ABI 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) as previously described.
Test_Line_9803 The PCR product was run on a 2% agarose gel, then cut from the gel, purified and subcloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
Test_Line_9804 Other genetic aberrations require identification. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) is essential for normal hematopoiesis and differentiation.
Test_Line_9805 If the LP is positive, intrathecal chemotherapy with cytarabine or methotrexate is recommended, given concurrently with systemic induction therapy.
Test_Line_9806 Mutations in epigenetic modifiers account for new classes of mutant disease alleles that contribute to the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies in addition to the classical class I genes that affect proliferation and class II genes that affect differentiation.
Test_Line_9807 In addition to the TET family, there are other alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes that may be similarly inhibited by 2-HG.
Test_Line_9808 Based on the current practice pattern and the literature, this Special Article provides recommendations and guidelines for laboratory practice for detection of mutations in the JAK2 and MPL genes, including clinical manifestations for prompting the mutation analysis, current and recommended methodologies for testing the mutations, and standardization for reporting the test results.
Test_Line_9809 Research into basic leukemia biology using banked samples from clinical trials may provide keys to altered cellular pathways, which may lead to new treatment options.
Test_Line_9810 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Test_Line_9811 Unblinding of the study-drug assignments and crossover from placebo to ruxolitinib were permitted for protocol-defined worsening splenomegaly (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9812 Although several mutational studies of ASXL1 have been impaired by the inclusion of nonsomatic variants, mutations in ASXL1 are associated with poor outcome in patients with MDS and in patients with AML.
Test_Line_9813 In the HOVON trial, the benefit in OS outcomes for the dose-escalated daunorubicin group was observed only in patients aged 65 years and younger or in those with CBF translocations.
Test_Line_9814 Instead, Li et al found BCORL1 to be mutated by searching for recurrent mutations in a discovery cohort of 8 patients with secondary AML (s-AML) that were subjected to whole-exome sequencing.
Test_Line_9815 All mutations were heterozygous apart from STAG2 and SMC1A mutations in male patients, as both genes are X-linked.
Test_Line_9816 CALR-mutant patients had a significantly longer large-splenomegaly-free survival compared with the remaining patients with PMF (P <.001, data not shown).
Test_Line_9817 Molecular Markers and Risk Stratification: The intermediate-risk cytogenetic category is the most heterogeneous group in AML, because it encompasses both normal karyotype without gross structural abnormalities and those with structural changes that are considered neither poor-risk or favorable.
Test_Line_9818 Most patients with EZH2 or ASXL1 mutations had low or intermediate-1 risk according to the IPSS (86% and 73%, respectively).
Test_Line_9819 Among patients who received ruxolitinib, anemia and thrombocytopenia were the most common adverse events, but they rarely led to discontinuation of the drug (in one patient for each event).
Test_Line_9820 For those with significant residual blasts or clear-cut induction failure, escalation to high-dose cytarabine with or without an anthracycline is the most common salvage strategy.
Test_Line_9821 Patients with significant CNS signs or symptoms at presentation should be evaluated using appropriate imaging techniques, such as radiography, CT, or MRI for detection of intracranial bleeding, leptomeningeal disease, or mass lesions in either the brain or spinal cord.
Test_Line_9822 Imai et al. found that one of five CMML patients examined had V105X mutation and Nakao et al. reported that one out of eight patients with CMML had RUNX1 mutation.
Test_Line_9823 Two laboratories reported results as one of six categories (>=78%, 50% to 78%, ..., <5%), and one laboratory reported results in three categories (homozygous, heterozygous, and low-level heterozygous).
Test_Line_9824 ASXL1, EZH2, KDM6A, IDH1 exon 4, IDH2 exon 4, and ETV6 were analyzed by means of Sanger sequencing.
Test_Line_9825 The different parental origins of the remaining chromosome 7 within the same family led to the hypothesis of the existence of a "mutator gene" located outside of chromosome 7.
Test_Line_9826 Survival rates were 77% (at 20 years) and 62% (at 30 years) in this series of 14 patients with GATA2 mutations (Figure 2A).
Test_Line_9827 Like JAK2 and MPL mutations, somatic mutations of CALR behave as driver mutations responsible for the myeloproliferative phenotype.
Test_Line_9828 For all applicable variables, however, patients with missing baseline values were excluded from the analyses of change and percent change from baseline.
Test_Line_9829 In addition, patients with unfavorable karyotypes, such as -7, -5, 11q23 abnormalities or complex cytogenetic abnormalities, are also considered poor-risk.
Test_Line_9830 One approach to improving the IPSS would be to include one additional variable: the presence or absence of a mutation in any of the five genes with independent prognostic significance.
Test_Line_9831 Also, proinflammatory cytokines that play an important role in myelofibrosis signal through JAK 1 (JAK1) and JAK2.
Test_Line_9832 A 1-muL aliquot of cDNA was used for the first PCR amplification for 30 cycles, using primers, M1u and M1d.
Test_Line_9833 For patients who present with solitary extramedullary disease (often referred to as myeloid sarcoma, granulocytic sarcoma, or chloroma) without overt marrow disease, the initial treatment should still be based on systemic induction chemotherapy.
Test_Line_9834 What Are the Needs for Standardization and Proficiency Testing?
Test_Line_9835 All of the aberrant transcripts with intragenic deletion of exon 5 contained the PTPase core motif. Aberrant transcripts from our normal controls all had the same deletion locations as the AML patients, although aberrant transcripts occurred more frequently in the AML specimens and cell lines.
Test_Line_9836 Blood and medullar tests revealed a mild neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, B-cell deficiencies, and a very slightly hypoplastic BM with a normal karyotype.
Test_Line_9837 Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm, with only ~200 patients reported to date, mostly culled from case reports and small case series.
Test_Line_9838 In sum, our studies found the widespread presence of mutations in genes involved in splicing in myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_9839 The differences in phenotypes described among these reports may be attributable to the different approaches used to target Tet2.
Test_Line_9840 In 2008, the World Health Organization expanded the classification of myeloproliferative disorders based on increasing amounts of molecular and cytogenetic data.
Test_Line_9841 We identified additional somatic mutations in spliceosomal genes, including SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2.
Test_Line_9842 A JAK2 exon-12 mutation screen may be warranted in patients who were JAK2V617F negative, particularly in those with subnormal EPO levels.
Test_Line_9843 Moreover, BCOR increases the repression of transcriptional activity by interacting with class I and II HDACs, the polycomb group protein PCGF1/NSPC1 and the histone demethylase FBXL10, which implies BCOR may suppress gene transcription by epigenetic mechanisms.
Test_Line_9844 Changes in symptoms recorded with the MFSAF were directionally consistent with the assessments made with other validated and common patient-reported outcome instruments used in this study.
Test_Line_9845 She was allografted and is still alive 1 year later.
Test_Line_9846 The median OS among patients with FLT3-ITD in the absence of a wild-type FLT3 was only 7 months compared with 46 months among both the patient subgroups with wild-type FLT3 with or without FLT3-ITD.
Test_Line_9847 Although the gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding Janus kinase (JAK) 2 (JAK2V617F) is present in approximately 50% of patients with primary myelofibrosis, other mechanisms of direct or indirect activation of the intracellular JAK- signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway are known, suggesting that dysregulation of this pathway is a central pathogenic component in myelofibrosis, regardless of the mutational status of JAK2.
Test_Line_9848 During the past decade, there have been major efforts to better define the genetic lesions underlying the large group of AML with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML) that accounts for 40-50% of all AML cases.

Test_Line_9850 Harada et al. did not find RUNX1 mutations in four patients with CMML, nor did Preudhomme et al. in 27 CMML patients.
Test_Line_9851 The hotspot region of ASXL1 exon 12 (n = 6 amplicons) was investigated by conventional Sanger sequencing using primer sequences as published by Gelsi-Boyer et al
Test_Line_9852 These regimens are based on a backbone of cytarabine and an anthracycline, and have changed little in the past 25 years.
Test_Line_9853 The model was generated from a stepwise Cox regression model that included the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category (based on the percentage of blasts in bone marrow, the karyotype, and the number of cytopenias [see Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix]), age, sex, and mutation status for genes that were mutated in 1% or more of the 428 samples for which the IPSS classification was recalculated. Age was included in the analysis as a categorical variable on the basis of a best-split algorithm showing a significant difference in overall survival between patients less than 55 years of age and those 55 years of age or older (see Table 8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_9854 Informed consent for sample collection was obtained according to protocols approved by the institutional review boards and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Test_Line_9855 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_9856 Next-generation pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified exons of TET2, RUNX1, TP53, CDKN2A, PTEN, NPM1 exon 11, and CBL exons 8 and 9 was performed with the use of a next-generation sequencing platform (454 Life Sciences).
Test_Line_9857 The present study also highlights the frequent early myeloid transformation in patients carrying a GATA2 mutation associated with a poor outcome linked to a refractory status of disease after initiation of chemotherapy.
Test_Line_9858 Although DNMT1, DNMT3B and DNMT3L have all been reported to be affected by rare somatic mutations in human malignancies, DNMT3A is the only DNMT family member that is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9859 Conditioning regimes and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was variable, and significant differences were not found between protocols.
Test_Line_9860 Although we identified 2 mutant copies of U2AF1 (21q22.3) in a sAML case with trisomy 21 (supplemental Figure 2), all other 19 cases of trisomy 21 screened for this mutation were negative.
Test_Line_9861 High numbers of informative patients (those with mutations) are needed to establish correlations with response to specific drugs.
Test_Line_9862 Preleukemic hematologic and immunologic parameters.
Test_Line_9863 All the cases were AML de novo, from 18 to 76 years old.
Test_Line_9864 Patients initially treated with high-dose cytarabine and who have significant residual blasts 7 to 10 days after completion of induction chemotherapy are considered to have experienced induction failure.
Test_Line_9865 All together, these data suggest that PRC2 alterations seem to be haploinsufficient in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9866 Somatic loss of function of HDAC8 impairs SMC3 deacetylation, leading to decreased cohesin occupancy and altered transcriptional programs, underscoring a role for cohesin in gene regulation.
Test_Line_9867 A sample report for a quantitative JAK2 V617F assay is presented as Table 5.
Test_Line_9868 Detection of somatic spliceosomal mutations in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_9869 Which Methodologies Are Used to Detect JAK2 and MPL Mutations?
Test_Line_9870 In contrast, mutations of EZH2, which lies on the distal portion of chromosome 7q, were not associated with 7q deletions.
Test_Line_9871 Similar results were obtained when considering NPM1-mutated CN-AML patients or when looking at the different prognostic groups in the European LeukemiaNet classification (data not shown).
Test_Line_9872 A total of 51% of all patients had at least one point mutation, including 52% of the patients with normal cytogenetics.
Test_Line_9873 Seishi Ogawa.
Test_Line_9874 Their impact on clinical parameters should also be clarified.
Test_Line_9875 The monocyte count was very low, with a median value of 0.05 G/L (25th percentile: 0.03; 75th percentile: 0.17).
Test_Line_9876 This will also be informative regarding the extent to which CSF3R mutation is a primary driver of disease.
Test_Line_9877 This latter observation generated the hypothesis of genetic "predestination," in which early driver mutations dictate future trajectories of subclonal evolution with distinct clinical outcomes.
Test_Line_9878 Myelodysplastic syndromes are clinically heterogeneous disorders characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, impaired differentiation, peripheral-blood cytopenias, and a risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia.
Test_Line_9879 Figure 2. Hazard Ratios for Death from Any Cause, According to Presence (vs. Absence) of Mutation in Each of Seven Genes. Results are shown, on a log10 scale, for univariate analyses as well as for analyses with adjustment for the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk category (based on the percentage of blasts in bone marrow, the karyotype, and the number of cytopenias) (for details, see Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). CI denotes confidence interval.
Test_Line_9880 Moreover, Yoshida et al analyzed 29 cases with different subtypes of myelodysplasia and identified mutations of multiple components of the RNA splicing machinery, including SF3B1, U2AF35, SRSF2, ZRSR2, SF3A1 and PRPF40B, in 16 cases.
Test_Line_9881 SF3B1 mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis, whereas U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations are predictive for shorter survival.
Test_Line_9882 An estimate of the relative abundance of mutant to wild-type alleles may be provided; this is especially important for novel mutations, which could represent previously unreported germline SNPs.
Test_Line_9883 The frequent evolution to MDS and AML of patients with GATA2 mutations reveals the importance of screening for this mutation in chronic neutropenia, especially when associated with monocytopenia because of frequent hematopoietic transformation, variable clinical expression at onset, and the need of aggressive strategy therapy in patients with poor clinical outcome.
Test_Line_9884 Therefore, if other World Health Organization major and minor diagnostic criteria are met, finding such a low-positive JAK2 mutation may still be clinically relevant.
Test_Line_9885 The results showed aberrant PTEN/MMAC1 transcripts in 15 of the 62 (24%) AML patients, 4 of the 5 cell lines (80%), and 4 of the 30 (13%) normal controls.
Test_Line_9886 If the clinical utility of mutations in other genes (eg, TET2, ASXL1, and EZH2) is established for MPNs, next-generation sequencing provides a way to expand the scope of the assay without significantly increasing the work required to perform the test.
Test_Line_9887 Thrombotic events were defined as described in detail by the CYTO-PV Collaborative Group.
Test_Line_9888 Paired-end 90-bp reads were generated and subjected to data analysis with the use of the platform provided by DNAnexus.
Test_Line_9889 The specific diagnostic criteria are presented below.
Test_Line_9890 Table 1. Frequency of Mutation and Association with Median Survival.
Test_Line_9891 Management of AML in Patients Younger Than 60 Years.
Test_Line_9892 HLA typing of family members is recommended for patients younger than 60 years who do not have favorable-risk cytogenetics.
Test_Line_9893 The allele burden varies greatly (between 1% and 100%) from patient to patient at the time of first diagnosis, and low levels of JAK2 V617F are not uncommon.
Test_Line_9894 A hypercellular bone marrow is observed with a myeloid hyperplasia and prominent granulocytic dysplasia, although multilineage dysplasia may be present.
Test_Line_9895 What Are the Currently Known JAK2 and MPL Mutations?
Test_Line_9896 Allele-specific qPCR also allows for quantification of the mutant as a percentage of all of the JAK2 alleles, as an estimate of disease burden.
Test_Line_9897 Significance was determined at a 1-sided alpha level of 0.05.
Test_Line_9898 Numerical variables have been summarized by their median and range, and categorical variables by count and relative frequency (%) of each category.
Test_Line_9899 n = 116 (mutants), 776 (WT).
Test_Line_9900 Findings were similar for each individual mutation, with clonal expansion in 7 of 8 patients with STAG2 mutations (P = .05), 2 of 4 SMC3 mutant patients, as well as in the single patient with a RAD21 mutation.
Test_Line_9901 In a second example, one assay reported a specimen positive for JAK2 V617F that was reported negative in all other laboratories; however, that specimen was found to have a JAK2 exon 12 mutation, which is mutually exclusive with the V617F mutation.
Test_Line_9902 Treatment with ATRA results in a loss of PRC2 recruitment by PLZF-RARalpha while PRC1-mediated gene repression persists in an ATRA-insensitive manner.
Test_Line_9903 Patients with CALR mutation had a lower risk of developing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and marked leukocytosis compared with other subtypes.
Test_Line_9904 In median, the burden of EZH2 mutations was 45% of bidirectional sequencing reads (range: 1.4-88%) per patient.
Test_Line_9905 Recurrent pneumonia was present in 5 patients and severe and chronic warts and/or genital HPV was observed in 6 patients.
Test_Line_9906 All except SET-2 are homozygous mutant, but some (eg, HEL) have more than two copies of JAK2 and as such are not ideal as standards.
Test_Line_9907 Nucleotide positions are determined based on the cited sources.
Test_Line_9908 The presence of an isolated NPM1 or CEBPA mutation improves prognosis only slightly less than for patients with CBF translocations (see "Initial Evaluation" on page 999).
Test_Line_9909 The median neutrophil count was 1.5 G/L (25th percentile: 1.2; 75th percentile: 2.0), although the count was mildly diminished, all patients experienced at least once a neutropenia between 0.5 and 1.2 G/L.
Test_Line_9910 STAG1, STAG2, SMC3, and RAD21 mutations had no influence on OS and RFS, whereas the analysis was not performed for SMC1A due to the low mutation frequency (Table 2).
Test_Line_9911 BM smears were available at baseline for 4 patients.
Test_Line_9912 The patient had 3 sons and 2 miscarriages.
Test_Line_9913 In vitro analyses of several of these EZH2 mutants suggest that these mutations confer loss-of-function.
Test_Line_9914 It is not clear whether BAP1 or ASXL1 mutations lead to alterations in H2AK119 ubiquitylation in vivo.
Test_Line_9915 In both cases, copy-number data and sequencing data reveal that these are loss-of-function, frequently heterozygous alterations that often occur in concert in the same patient sample.
Test_Line_9916 In 2006, mutations in a second gene, myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL), were identified in both ET and PMF patients.
Test_Line_9917 In addition, the mutation status of the RUNX1 gene was also correlated with the clinicohematological features and outcome in CMML patients to determine its clinical and prognostic relevance.
Test_Line_9918 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_9919 Patients whose performance status would make them poor candidates for the standard antineoplastic regimens may still be able to participate in clinical trials using epigenetic agents designed to target this underserved patient population.
Test_Line_9920 On the contrary, PMF with nonmutated JAK2, CALR, or MPL has a poor prognosis with a particularly high risk of leukemic transformation, as shown by a study of the Mayo Clinic and by the present work.
Test_Line_9921 Clinical phenotypes that correspond to specific cytogenetic patterns were variable among the disease groups.
Test_Line_9922 We next investigated associations of distinct mutations, however, no specific pattern was observed, that is, EZH2 mutations were detected in combination with TET2 alterations (4/10), ASXL1 (3/10), RUNX1 (3/10), CBL (2/10), JAK2 (2/10), NRAS (2/10), KRAS (1/10) and IDH2 (1/10), respectively (Figure 1a).
Test_Line_9923 Mutations in the cohesin gene complex.
Test_Line_9924 Paired BM mononuclear cells and CD3+ peripheral blood lymphocytes were used as germline controls.
Test_Line_9925 RUNX1 mutations have been described in the M0 subtype of AML, radiation-associated and chemotherapy-related MDS or AML, or in patients with de novo high-risk MDS; however, only a small number of patients with CMML have been examined for RUNX1 mutations, and the frequency and patterns of RUNX1 mutations in CMML remain to be defined.
Test_Line_9926 The most widely used methods for the detection of V617F involve allele-specific qPCR.
Test_Line_9927 A series of small studies that involved 55 patients with PMF, 25 patients with PMF, and 104 patients with PMF, PV, or ET reported a 47% 5-year probability of survival, 41% projected 2-year overall survival, and 58% 3-year survival, respectively.
Test_Line_9928 Figure 2. Clinical evolution. (A) Kaplan-Meier survival curve of GATA2-mutated patients. Confidence intervals of 95% are indicated. (B) Evolution of GATA2-mutated patients to MDS or AML from birth to evolution to MDS or AML or last follow-up. Confidence intervals of 95% are indicated.
Test_Line_9929 The spectrum of gene mutations in MDS and related myeloid neoplasms includes mutations involving classical signaling molecules, such as NRAS/KRAS, PTNP11, NF1, c-CBL, JAK2, and FLT3, and those involving hematopoietic transcription factors, such as RUNX1, ETV6, and CEBPA, together with TP53 and other tumor suppressor genes.
Test_Line_9930 No recurrent deletion, amplification, or uniparental disomy was detected by CGH (data not shown).
Test_Line_9931 Evaluation and Treatment of CNS Leukemia.
Test_Line_9932 The presence (vs. the absence) of EZH2 mutations was strongly associated with decreased overall survival in the stepwise, multi-variable model that considered age, sex, IPSS risk group, and the presence of other mutations (hazard ratio for death, 2.13 [95% CI, 1.36 to 3.33]).
Test_Line_9933 The karyotype was normal.
Test_Line_9934 We compared the allelic burden of mutations in the cohesin complex with the allelic burden of NPM1 mutations, as the level of the allelic burden can indicate clonal hierarchy of different mutations.
Test_Line_9935 The FERM domain, which resides at the amino terminus, functions as a binding protein transducing signals from JAK2 to other transmembrane cytokine receptors (Figure 1).
Test_Line_9936 To determine the relative contribution of mutation status to overall survival, we generated a multivariable Cox model, using a stepwise variable-selection procedure incorporating age, sex, IPSS classification, and mutation status for the 13 most frequently mutated genes identified in this study.
Test_Line_9937 For instance, Eed+/- mice develop severe, lethal myeloid and lymphoid proliferation.
Test_Line_9938 A heterozygous missense mutation in U2AF1 (Q157R) was found in a patient with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD) and uniparental disomy of 2q (UPD2q; Figure 1A).
Test_Line_9939 In an international study of 1054 patients with PMF, the overall median survival was found to be 5.8 years, but considerable variability was observed.
Test_Line_9940 Interestingly, a study in patients with NK-AML showed that prognosis was worse among patients with FLT3-ITD without a wild-type FLT3, compared with those with FLT3-ITD but having a wild-type FLT3 in the second allele.
Test_Line_9941 Single gene mutations are not currently used in prognostic scoring systems but are likely to be key drivers of clinical phenotypes and overall survival.
Test_Line_9942 For exploratory purposes, next we evaluated the prognostic influence of each gene in the cohesin complex separately in all patients, although this analysis is limited by the small number of mutated patients.
Test_Line_9943 In this assay, mutant transduced stem cells showed lower repopulating capacity compared to mock- or wild-type U2AF35-transduced cells, as determined by the chimerism in peripheral blood 6 weeks after transplantation, indicating that both U2AF35 mutants could disturb normal hematopoiesis.
Test_Line_9944 Bone marrow (BM) samples were obtained with informed consent from all patients at initial presentation.
Test_Line_9945 Representations generated by HpaII and by MspI restriction enzyme digestion of the genome followed by ligation-mediated PCR are compared to generate maps of methylation abundance and distribution.
Test_Line_9946 Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) that do not contain the BCR-ABL1 mutation include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Test_Line_9947 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_9948 Many institutions also use HLA typing to select platelet donors for allogeneic HSCT.
Test_Line_9949 The reaction was first denatured for 5 min at 95--degrees--C and incubated at 37--degrees--C for 60 min.
Test_Line_9950 Cohesin mutant MDS patients were more likely to be associated with high International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) scores (Table 1) and were more prevalent in patients who transformed to sAML.
Test_Line_9951 We also analyzed whether the locations and patterns of mutations had any clinical or prognostic effect on patients with CMML harboring RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_9952 DNMT3A and DNA methylation.
Test_Line_9953 Patients who do not receive postremission therapy will experience relapse, usually within 6 to 9 months.
Test_Line_9954 If a quantitative assay is clinically indicated to achieve precise mutant levels or to monitor allele burden, there will be a need for quantitative standards to accurately quantify the allele burden and to assess the sensitivity and dynamic range of the assay.
Test_Line_9955 Mutations in IDH1 have been reported in 6% to 9% of AML cases, with a higher frequency reported among patients with NK-AML (8%-16%).
Test_Line_9956 We also found that missense mutations of RUNX1 preferentially (89%) located in the RHD.
Test_Line_9957 IDH1 and IDH2: metabolic inputs.
Test_Line_9958 Analyses were conducted in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.
Test_Line_9959 Mutations in NPM1 have been described in 6% (6/97) of CMML patients and were associated with a poor prognosis.
Test_Line_9960 Patient population.
Test_Line_9961 Such phenotypes would then be absent in myeloid cells lacking the corresponding transcripts.
Test_Line_9962 We observed decreased expression of DCK and increased expression of UCK in patients with cohesin mutations or with nonmutational suppression of cohesin expression, indicating common alterations of downstream pathways (supplemental Table 12).
Test_Line_9963 In more detail, we observed 10 novel different EZH2 mutations in nine patients: 6 missense, 3 frameshifts (2 deletions, 1 insertion) and 1 splice mutation (Supplementary Table 4).
Test_Line_9964 Initial Evaluation.
Test_Line_9965 TET2 mutations, in contrast, overlapped with lesions in nearly every other mutated gene, suggesting that TET2 mutations have a pathogenic role that is at least partially independent of other abnormalities.
Test_Line_9966 Together, except for the two patients carrying biallelic heterozygous mutations, the remaining were monoallelic heterozygous mutations.
Test_Line_9967 The use of liposomal cytarabine, which has a longer half-life, for intrathecal use offers the benefit of less frequent (once weekly) administration.
Test_Line_9968 Abbreviations: AVWS = acute von Willebrand syndrome; Hct = hematocrit; PV = polycythemia vera.
Test_Line_9969 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous hematologic malignancy characterized by the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and/or other tissues.
Test_Line_9970 The IPSS assigns patients to one of four groups of increasing prognostic risk (low, intermediate 1, intermediate 2, and high) on the basis of the percentage of blasts in bone marrow, the karyotype, and the number of cytopenias present at the time of diagnosis (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
Test_Line_9971 The frequent evolution to MDS and AML in these patients reveals the importance of screening GATA2 in chronic neutropenia associated with monocytopenia because of the frequent hematopoietic transformation, variable clinical expression at onset, and the need for aggressive therapy in patients with poor clinical outcome.
Test_Line_9972 The subsequent analysis of the French Severe Chronic Neutropenia Registry allowed the identification of 6 additional pedigrees and 10 patients with 6 different and not previously reported GATA2 mutations (R204X, E224X, R330X, A372T, M388V, and a complete deletion of the GATA2 locus).
Test_Line_9973 Table 2. 2008 World Health Organization Diagnostic Criteria for Essential Thrombocythemia.
Test_Line_9974 All samples were barcode-tagged using 48.48 Access Array technology (Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA, USA), starting with 50 ng genomic DNA per sample (PCR amplification protocol, Supplementary Table 2).
Test_Line_9975 As in our previous study of TSG101, the abnormal transcripts may result from aberrant RNA splicing as evidenced by the presence of both these aberrant transcripts and normal full length transcripts in all specimens examined.
Test_Line_9976 In follow-up sequencing of an expanded cohort of 29 patients from the New England Journal of Medicine report, 21% have exhibited both CSF3R and SETBP1 mutations, with 31% of samples having CSF3R mutations only and 7% with SETBP1 mutations only (Figure 1).
Test_Line_9977 IPSS and DIPSS risks were estimated as previously described.
Test_Line_9978 In the previously discussed SWOG/ECOG trial, the 5-year survival rates (from time of CR) for patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics were 36% for the autologous HSCT group (n = 37; 59% underwent HSCT) and 52% for the allogeneic HSCT group (n = 47; 66% underwent HSCT).
Test_Line_9979 In the present study, we describe the initial identification by exome sequencing of a GATA2 R396Q mutation in a family with a history of chronic mild neutropenia evolving to AML and/or MDS.
Test_Line_9980 Chromosomal abnormalities were described according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature.
Test_Line_9981 Analysis of copy number state was done using BRLMM-PPlus algorithm with regional GC correction, embedded in Genotyping Console Version 2.0 and Chromosome Analysis Suite software (Affymetrix).
Test_Line_9982 In vivo studies demonstrated the induction of PV-, ET-, and PMF-like diseases in JAK2V617F-positive transgenic mice and the relative disease phenotypes could be partially anticipated by allelic burden.
Test_Line_9983 Allogeneic HSCT in first CR was associated with a significantly lower 3-year cumulative relapse rate (22% vs. 62%; P < .001) and higher 3-year relapse-free survival rate (56% vs. 29%; P < .001) compared with the non-HSCT group.
Test_Line_9984 PCR amplifications were carried out as described previously.
Test_Line_9985 No correlation was observed between genes in the cohesin complex and other mutations such as FLT3-ITD, IDH1, IDH2, or NRAS mutations.
Test_Line_9986 A large randomized phase III ECOG study reported a significant increase in CR rate (71% vs. 57%; P < .001) and median OS (24 vs. 16 months; P = .003) using daunorubicin 90 mg/m2 x 3 days (n = 327) versus 45 mg/m2 x 3 days (n = 330) in patients with previously untreated AML younger than 60 years.
Test_Line_9987 Some studies have reported the lack of prognostic value of IDH2 mutations, whereas others have reported favorable outcomes with IDH2 mutations.
Test_Line_9988 Likewise, enzymatic activities associated with genes involved in leukaemic transformation - including H3K79 methyl transferase activity, histone acetyltransferase activity and other chromatin enzymatic functions - have just recently been explored from a therapeutic standpoint.
Test_Line_9989 We performed a multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression considering type of mutation (CALR, JAK2, MPL, or none of the previous mutations) and each single variable included in the IPSS score at diagnosis (age >65 years, hemoglobin <10 g/dL, WBC count >25 x 109/L, peripheral blood blasts >=1%, and presence of constitutional symptoms).
Test_Line_9990 Further investigation in clinical trial settings will be required to determine whether JAK kinase inhibition in the setting of CSF3R mutation will lead to greater decreases in mutation allele burden compared with the responses observed in the setting of JAK2V617F.
Test_Line_9991 Although some mutations in these factors are activating, most are loss-of-function or hypomorphic mutations and affect bona fide tumor suppressor genes (TSGs).
Test_Line_9992 Proficiency testing for JAK2 V617F is now standard, and it is likely that MPL codon 515 mutations will be added in the future.
Test_Line_9993 Our analysis showed a similar expression profile in patients with STAG2 mutations or patients with reduced expression of cohesin complex members (Figure 6A).
Test_Line_9994 In a study of 137 patients with PV, 11% displayed abnormal genotypes, with Y- (7% of male patients), +8, +9, 20q-, and abnormalities of chromosome 1, 13q-, 11q-, 3p-, and dup13 were observed with the highest frequency.
Test_Line_9995 The long concatenated DNA was then sheared into 100 to 250 bp fragments using the Covaris System (Covaris, Woburn, MA) to obtain randomly fragmented sequences, and was size selected for 200 bp fragments using Agencourt AMPure XP reagent (Agencourt Bioscience Corp., Beverly, MA).
Test_Line_9996 In a joint study conducted by the Dutch-Belgian and Swiss cooperative groups (HOVON/SAKK) evaluating the correlation between cytogenetics and OS outcomes in patients aged 60 years or younger with AML (N = 1975), the 4-year OS rate in patients with monosomal karyotype was 4% compared with 26% in those with complex karyotype (but without monosomal karyotype).
Test_Line_9997 This Special Article also points to future directions for genomic testing in BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Test_Line_9998 Genotyping of germ-line DNA from buccal swabs revealed that the mutations in these 10 genes were somatic, except for those in MET (E168D in three samples), EGFR (T790M in one sample), and CDH1 (A617T in three samples).
Test_Line_9999 Known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), intronic polymorphisms more than six bases from a splice junction, and silent mutations were excluded from further analysis.
Test_Line_10000 The advantages and disadvantages of each technique, including financial considerations associated with intellectual property rights, must therefore be carefully weighed before deciding on the type of assay to implement (Table 4).
Test_Line_10001 Christiansen et al. found that RUNX1 mutations were significantly associated with monosomy 7 or 7q- in therapy-related MDS.
Test_Line_10002 Patients with residual blasts without hypoplasia may receive additional standard-dose cytarabine with an anthracycline or mitoxantrone.
Test_Line_10003 Interestingly, we found a strong correlation between the cohesin gene and NPM1 mutations (57% of cohesin gene mutated patients had an NPM1 mutation; 9.5% of NPM1 mutated patients had a cohesin gene mutation compared with 4% of NPM1 wild-type patients; P = .029) (Table 1).
Test_Line_10004 Epigenetic roles for class I and class II genes.
Test_Line_10005 Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (Table 1).
Test_Line_10006 Figure 1. Mutations in CSF3R and SETBP1 are common in CNL and aCML. Percentages of CSF3R, SETBP1, and JAK2 V617F mutations in 29 patients with CNL or aCML are shown. CSF3R mutations arise in 2 classes, nonsense or frameshift mutations that truncate the cytoplasmic tail (truncation mutations) and point mutations in the extracellular domain (membrane proximal mutation), and some cases exhibit both classes of mutations on the same allele (compound mutations). These mutations can occur in isolation or in combination with other mutant genes, with 21% of patients having both CSF3R and SETBP1 mutations. One patient exhibited mutations in both CSF3R (G683R) and JAK2 (V617F); however, the clonality of this double mutation could not be established due to limited material, presenting the possibility of polyclonal populations of tumor cells with distinct mutational profiles. The frequencies of each class of CSF3R mutation alone or in combination with SETBP1 or JAK2 are shown for a combined cohort of CNL and aCML (n = 29), the CNL cases only (n = 9), and the aCML cases only (n = 20).
Test_Line_10007 Best supportive care is always an option for patients who cannot tolerate or do not wish to pursue further intensive treatment.
Test_Line_10008 In general, supportive care measures may include the use of blood products or transfusion support, tumor lysis prophylaxis, neurologic assessments, antiinfective prophylaxis, and use of growth factors.
Test_Line_10009 PATIENTS AND METHODS.
Test_Line_10010 Among patients in whom the study drug was interrupted, symptoms (assessed by means of the total symptom score) returned to baseline levels over a period of approximately 1 week (Fig.
Test_Line_10011 RUNX1 mutations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and mutations at the C-terminal region might predict acute myeloid leukemia transformation.
Test_Line_10012 Mutated allele frequencies were similar between NPM1 and cohesin gene mutations. Overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and complete remission rates (CR) were not influenced by the presence of cohesin mutations (OS: hazard ratio [HR] 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-1.72 [P = .94]; RFS: HR 0.7; 95% CI, 0.36-1.38 [P = .3]; CR: mutated 83% vs wild-type 76% [P = .45]).
Test_Line_10013 Taken together, 16.7% (5/30) of CMML patients carrying RUNX1 mutations had cooperating mutations of FLT3 or RAS genes.
Test_Line_10014 Intermediate-1-risk patients who are transfusion dependent or with unfavorable cytogenetics, intermediate-2-risk patients, and highrisk patients are candidates for investigational drug therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Test_Line_10015 Four nonsense mutations were located in the RHD that generate termination codons resulting in truncated RUNX1 proteins.
Test_Line_10016 With less common mutations, it is not clear what level of analytical sensitivity is needed.
Test_Line_10017 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_10018 It should be noted, however, that there are major differences in median OS between the same genotypic entities as estimated in the Mayo Clinic vs the present study: 2.5 vs 3.2 years in triple-negative, 4.1 vs 9.1 years in MPL-mutant, 4.3 vs 9.2 years in JAK2-mutant, and 8.2 vs 17.7 years in CALR-mutant patients.
Test_Line_10019 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival rates.
Test_Line_10020 If the LP is negative, the patient can be followed with a repeat LP if symptoms persist.
Test_Line_10021 The most promising JAK2 inhibitors are TG101348 and INCB018424.
Test_Line_10022 Given that IDH mutations lead to a gain-of-function mutation, it may be possible to design small-molecule inhibitors that specifically block the synthesis of 2-HG, with therapeutic response monitored through serum 2-HG levels and epigenetic patterning.
Test_Line_10023 Demonstration of a JAK2V617 PB mutation confirms the presence of MPN and is highly suggestive of ET in the absence of erythrocytosis.
Test_Line_10024 Five of the samples resulted in failed amplifications in more than one laboratory, and these had very low DNA concentrations.
Test_Line_10025 Effect of spliceosomal mutations on clinical outcomes.
Test_Line_10026 BCORL1 is also a transcriptional corepressor and functional studies have shown that it can bind to class II histone deacetylases (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7), to interact with the CTBP1 corepressor, and to affect the repression of E-cadherin.
Test_Line_10027 For the assessment of bone marrow fibrosis, paraffin sections were stained with Gomori silver impregnation technique, and fibrosis was assessed semiquantitatively following the European consensus guidelines.
Test_Line_10028 Interestingly, among patients with AML, ASXL1 mutations seem to occur in an age-dependent manner and are more enriched in AML from an antecedent haematological disorder rather than in de novo AML.
Test_Line_10029 The beads were then added to the Flow Chip for sequencing in the SOLiD system (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany), and sequenced according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies).
Test_Line_10030 Earlier studies of RUNX1 mutations in CMML were carried out by the PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism approach, and mainly focused on RHD (exons 3--5).
Test_Line_10031 Patients with t(15;17) were excluded from any analyses.
Test_Line_10032 Adverse effects were reported in 96% of patients, and treatment was stopped in 10% of these due to toxicity.
Test_Line_10033 Another gene recently described to be mutated in clonal hematological diseases is ASXL1 on chromosome 20q11.1.
Test_Line_10034 RESULTS.
Test_Line_10035 In the ruxolitinib group, patients with new-onset grade 3 or 4 anemia had symptomatic improvement similar to that in patients without anemia.
Test_Line_10036 We did not find major differences between CALR-mutant patients with the 52-bp deletion (type 1 mutation) and those with the 5-bp insertion (type 2 mutation).
Test_Line_10037 As shown in Figure 1A, CALR-mutant patients had a lower cumulative incidence of anemia compared with JAK2-mutant (P <.001), MPL-mutant (P = .004), and triple-negative patients (P <.001).
Test_Line_10038 METHODS.
Test_Line_10039 Additionally, 5-hmC may lead to passive demethylation as DNMT1 is unable to recognize 5-hmC; methylation marks thus become lost in succeeding DNA replication cycles, as newly incorporated cytosines in the daughter strand fail to become methylated.
Test_Line_10040 We were unable to find any correlation between RAD21 and RUNX1 expression or between mutational status and expression in our patient cohorts, suggesting that this interaction in humans may be subject to pathway redundancy.
Test_Line_10041 In contrast, most patients who received placebo had progressive splenomegaly and worsening of myelofibrosis-related symptoms.
Test_Line_10042 Studies of embryonic stem cells have demonstrated enrichment of 5-hmC in CpG dinucleotides near transcriptional start sites and in intragenic regions, and 5-hmC placement in these regulatory regions is associated with increased gene expression.
Test_Line_10043 The presence of IDH2 mutations was mutually exclusive with IDH1 mutation in nearly all cases.
Test_Line_10044 Fig. 1. After the recognition of the 50 splice site by U1 snRNP complex, a protein complex consisting of a U2AF heterodimer, ZRSR2 and SRSF1/2 was recruited to the 30 splice boundary, where the smaller subunit (U2AF35) of the U2AF heterodimer binds to the AG-dinucleotide, while the larger subunits recognize a polypyrimidine tract. SRSF1 and SRSF2 belong to a SR family of proteins, having one or more Serine-Arginine-rich domains, and bind to splicing enhancer sequences and also interact with other proteins through its SR domain. To the 50 upstream of the polypyrimidine tract lies a branchpoint sequence, to which another splicing factor, SF-1, binds and together with the U2AF heterodimer and other components, participates in the establishment of the splicing E complex. Once the splicing E complex is established, a U2 snRNP complex replaces SF-1 to generate the splicing A complex. Prominently, all the major components of these splicing complex are targets of gene mutations in MDS.
Test_Line_10045 The first study to identify this high-risk subgroup was HOVON.
Test_Line_10046 BCORL1 mutations mostly occurred in patients with s-AML and/or with abnormal karyotype, and carried germline TP53, CEBPA and NPM1 genes.
Test_Line_10047 ET.
Test_Line_10048 The interaction between the TP53 mutations and the genes more recently reported to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes have not been studied in a large enough number of patients to establish their independent prognostic significance.

Test_Line_10050 The majority of the MPL mutations are found in exon 10 codon 515; W515L is the most common, followed by W515K.
Test_Line_10051 Mutations in IDH2 have been reported in 8% to 12% of patients with AML, with a frequency of 19% reported among those with normal karyotype.
Test_Line_10052 MPL.
Test_Line_10053 This includes decreased expression of signaling effectors (NRAS, JAK1, and CBL) and reduced expression of HIF1A, suggesting a novel mechanism of transformation for patients with myeloid malignancies characterized by alterations in the cohesin complex.
Test_Line_10054 Cell fractionation.
Test_Line_10055 Most of the mutations we detected were heterozygous, indicating that homozygous mutations may lead to cell death or that some of the functional consequences are related to dominant negative effects.
Test_Line_10056 The presence of hypomorphic mutations suggests that somatic alterations of cohesin lead to loss of function.
Test_Line_10057 If no donor is immediately available, patients should be considered for a clinical trial.
Test_Line_10058 The FLT3-TKD mutations predominantly occur independently of FLT3-ITD, and most frequently involve mutations in the D835 residue of a tyrosine kinase domain.
Test_Line_10059 Enriched libraries were tested for enrichment by quantitative PCR and for size distribution and concentration by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.
Test_Line_10060 Using deep sequencing and cross-sectional and serial analyses, we found that cohesin mutations were not commonly present in the founder clone but rather promoted clonal expansion and transformation to more aggressive disease.

Test_Line_10064 ==============================================================================`
Test_Line_10065 The male patients had a functionally homozygous mutation for STAG2 and SMC1A.
Test_Line_10066 Cytogenetic assessment was done in 54 of 62 cases, none had a chromosome 10 or 10q deletion.
Test_Line_10067 To define a set of somatically mutated genes in bone marrow aspirates 5 from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, we first examined 191 samples for abnormalities in known oncogenes (Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_10068 Over the last several years, our knowledge of genes being mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients has not only expanded due to the results of next generation and whole genome sequencing efforts, but we have also learned that mutations in AML occur in specific pathways.
Test_Line_10069 Interestingly, SF3B1 mutations, but not other splicing factor mutations, have also been reported in 5-15 % of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), especially in high-risk cases.
Test_Line_10070 In the ruxolitinib group, patients with new-onset grade 3 or 4 anemia had improvements in symptoms and reductions in spleen volume that were similar to those in patients without anemia (Fig. 9C and 9D in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_10071 A single NPM1 mutation, which localizes to the cytoplasm, confers a higher complete response (CR) rate and improved event-free survival (EFS) and OS compared with patients with NK-AML with wild-type NPM1, resulting in outcomes similar to patients with favorable cytogenetics (eg, CBF AML).
Test_Line_10072 Other candidate genes currently being evaluated for prognostic importance include TET2 and RUNX1.
Test_Line_10073 The u white blood count is >13 x 109/L, with immature granulocytes >10% of leukocytes and <20% blasts in the blood and marrow.
Test_Line_10074 MPL mutation detection was compared among the four participating laboratories.
Test_Line_10075 We investigated a family in which the mother (patient number 6227; P1, II, 4) developed at 35 years of age an AML M2 associated with myelodysplasia-related changes.
Test_Line_10076 Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 (StataCorp LP) software.
Test_Line_10077 The reaction was then stopped by heat inactivation at 95--degrees--C for 5 min.
Test_Line_10078 Constitutional symptoms improved significantly in 40%-60%, and dose-dependent weight gain was reported in patients with low body mass index.
Test_Line_10079 Transformation to AML occurred in 2 patients in this study; both patients received ruxolitinib and had baseline characteristics that placed them at increased risk for transformation.
Test_Line_10080 An additional five specimens were positive in all laboratories where results were obtained; some of the laboratories did not obtain a result with these specimens, most likely because of low DNA concentration.
Test_Line_10081 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_10082 Large splenomegaly was defined as a spleen tip extending >10 cm from left costal margin, as previously reported.
Test_Line_10083 Patient number 5593 (P3, II, 2) developed chronic neutropenia at the age of 30 associated with numerous HPV-induced warts since age of 14 years.
Test_Line_10084 Subsequent clinical trials have not included maintenance as postremission therapy.
Test_Line_10085 When this laboratory was excluded, there was complete concordance for 29 specimens, 18 of which were in the high category, 9 were in the moderate category, and 2 were in the low category.
Test_Line_10086 Loss-of-function mutations in ASXL1 have been identified in a range of myeloid malignancies, most commonly in patients with MDS, PMF or MDS/MPN overlap disorders.
Test_Line_10087 The PcG member that has been most frequently implicated in the pathogenesis of human malignancies is EZH2, the enzymatic component of the PRC2 complex.
Test_Line_10088 Similarly, the benefit in OS outcomes seen with CEBPA mutations seems to be lost in the presence of concurrent FLT3-ITD.
Test_Line_10089 Finally, the question of whether the recently characterized small molecular inhibitor of SF3B1 might have a therapeutic role in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms with splicing factor mutations remains to be addressed.

Test_Line_10094 The patient died 5 years later from an H1N1 influenza infection in complete remission.
Test_Line_10095 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_10096 The first PCR products were 1476 bp in length, and the length of nested PCR products was 1344 bp. Of the 62 AML specimens analyzed, 15 (24%) revealed the occurrence of aberrant PTEN/MMAC1 transcripts; a normalsized band was present in all specimens (Fig. 1A).
Test_Line_10097 Matched buccal DNA was available for 219 (49.9%) of the 439 samples analyzed in this study.
Test_Line_10098 More recently, Challen et al carried out more extensive analysis in vivo by studying the effect of Haematopoietic-specific conditional Dnmt3a deletion on self-renewal in serial transplantation assays.
Test_Line_10099 There was no clear pattern in these events to suggest a specific withdrawal effect (Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_10100 These studies thus confirmed somatic mutations in five genes (NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, JAK2, and PTPN11) known to be mutated in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and identified recurrent mutations in GNAS that have not been previously reported in hematologic cancers.
Test_Line_10101 If the relapse occurs after a relatively "long" (> 12 months) period of remission, retreatment with the previously successful induction regimen is an option.
Test_Line_10102 Clinical trials: NCCN believes that the best management for any cancer patient is in a clinical trial.
Test_Line_10103 Mutational Analysis of PTEN/MMAC1 by PCR-SSCP and Direct Sequencing.
Test_Line_10104 He developed, at the age of 18, AML with myelodysplastic features associated with a der(1;7)(q10;p10) leading to a monosomy 7q and a trisomy 1q.
Test_Line_10105 In late 2010, a sample exchange for interlaboratory comparison of assays for MPNs was organized by the AMP.
Test_Line_10106 Over the past 3 decades, the classification system for AML has evolved from the French American British (FAB) system, which relied on cytochemical stains and morphology to separate AML from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and to categorize the disease based on degree of myeloid and monocytic differentiation, to the system developed by the WHO.
Test_Line_10107 To detect allelic losses, the polymorphic short tandem repeat markers used were D10S215, D10S541, D10S579, and AFM086.
Test_Line_10108 In marked contrast, our patients with GATA2 mutations presented with monocytopenia with a median of 0.05 G/L.
Test_Line_10109 From September 2009 through April 2010, a total of 309 patients were enrolled: 155 were randomly assigned to ruxolitinib, and 154 were randomly assigned to placebo.
Test_Line_10110 MDS subtypes of refractory anemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts, and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia were classified as low-risk MDS.
Test_Line_10111 The majority of GATA2 mutations have been identified in MDS/AML, Emberger, or MonoMAC syndrome patients.
Test_Line_10112 The Roche product was added with 0.5 mM dNTP, 0.75 ml (25 mM) MgCl2, 1.6 M Betaine and three primer pairs (1 mM/each primer), with the sequences of primers and their nucleotide position shown in Supplementary Table 1, which cover the coding sequences from exons 3 to 8 of RUNX1b cDNA (GenBank accession number D43968).
Test_Line_10113 However, as a caveat, a recent study indicated that the OS benefit with CEBPA was observed for patients with double mutations of CEBPA but not for those with a single mutation of the gene; the 8-year OS rates reported in this study for patients with double-mutated CEBPA, single mutation of CEBPA, and wild-type gene were 54%, 31%, and 34%, respectively.
Test_Line_10114 IDH1 functions in the cytoplasm and in peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 functions in the mitochondria.
Test_Line_10115 Treatment with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ.1 leads to a 2-fold decrease in cohesin occupancy at superenhancer sites and normalization of the expression of oncogenic drivers.
Test_Line_10116 In first complete remission, he received a matched unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is still in remission 18 months after the allograft.
Test_Line_10117 Quantitative controls for the JAK2 V617F mutation are commercially available (Horizon Discovery, Cambridge, UK; Qiagen Marseille, Marseille, France) to serve as a quantitative or low-positive control.
Test_Line_10118 Mutation analysis was performed by sequencing the nine exons and adjacent intronic splice-junction regions of PTEN/MMAC1.
Test_Line_10119 Associations between gene mutations are represented by a Circos diagram (Figure 1).
Test_Line_10120 The representative regimens included are: 1) cladribine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), with or without mitoxantrone or idarubicin; 2) fludarabine, cytarabine, and G-CSF (FLAG regimen) with or without idarubicin; 3) etoposide and cytarabine, with or without mitoxantrone; or 4) clofarabine, cytarabine and G-CSF.
Test_Line_10121 Figure 1. Leukaemia-associated mutations in the DNA methylation and demethylation pathway. The process of DNA methylation and the enzymes involved are shown. Enzymes known to be affected by somatic mutations in myeloid leukaemia are marked with an asterisk. The catalytic domain of the TET family of methylcytosine dioxygenases is contained within the conserved carboxyl-terminal region. TET1 and TET3 each contain an amino-terminal CxxC zinc-finger domain that is probably responsible for DNA binding; by contrast, TET2 does not possess a CxxC domain, consistent with a likely requirement for other proteins to direct TET2 localization within the genome. There are splice variants of TET2 that do not contain the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain; the function of these variants, which are abundantly expressed in haematopoietic cells, are not yet understood. Although it is not yet clear whether 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) is consistently associated with activation and/or repression of transcription, 5-hmC has been shown to specifically recruit at least one protein-binding complex subunit - the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NURD) complex member methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) - to repress the transcription of genes marked by 5-hmC. Currently 5-carboxylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine, and 5-hydroxymethyluracil are only known to be by-products of 5-hmC in DNA demethylation, but no specific functions have been described. 2-HG, 2-hydroxyglutarate; alpha-KG, alpha-ketoglutarate; AID, activation-induced cytidine deaminase; BER, base-excision repair; DNMT3A, DNA methyltransferase 3A; IDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase; NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TDG, thymine DNA glycosylase.
Test_Line_10122 Re-evaluation using more sensitive techniques revealed higher frequencies: 95% to 97% in PV, approximately 55% in ET, and approximately 65% in PMF, suggesting that insensitive assay methods (eg, Sanger sequencing, which has an analytic sensitivity of 20%) generated a significant number of false-negative results.
Test_Line_10123 All patients studied during remission lost the mutation at this time point.
Test_Line_10124 Risk scores were calculated according to the International Prognostic Scoring System.
Test_Line_10125 This mutation was found in the vast majority of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and in approximately half of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Test_Line_10126 Equally disturbing is the increasing incidence of treatment-related myelodysplasia and acute leukemia in survivors of tumors of childhood and young adulthood.
Test_Line_10127 Myelofibrosis, a myeloproliferative neoplasm, is manifested by abnormal blood counts (anemia, thrombocytosis or thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis or leukopenia), splenomegaly, and debilitating symptoms (e.g., fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain, cachexia, weight loss, pruritus, night sweats, and bone pain), which are thought to be caused by the combined effects of massive splenomegaly and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines.
Test_Line_10128 Analytical Sensitivity.
Test_Line_10129 By analyzing copy-number alterations with the use of SNP arrays and oncogene mutations, by means of high-throughput genotyping, we identified new mutations in ETV6 and GNAS.
Test_Line_10130 For patients whose clinical condition has deteriorated such that active treatment is no longer appropriate, best supportive care should be continued.
Test_Line_10131 In conclusion, ruxolitinib was associated with reductions in splenomegaly and symptoms that are prominent manifestations of myelofibrosis and appeared to be associated with an improvement in overall survival.
Test_Line_10132 All P values were calculated with the use of two-sided tests.
Test_Line_10133 Mutation of NRAS, previously reported as a marker of poor prognosis, did not influence survival in this model, most likely owing to strong associations between oncogenic NRAS mutations and components of the IPSS.
Test_Line_10134 As such, elucidating the impact of epigenetic mutations on leukaemogenesis and therapeutic response will be essential for advancing our understanding and treatment of myeloid malignancies.

Test_Line_10140 Examination of the bone marrow shows a myeloid hyperplasia with full maturation with <5% myeloblasts (<1% in the peripheral blood).
Test_Line_10141 Although targeting of BCORL1 mutations to the expressed allele in female AML patients was not formally demonstrated by Li et al, the above findings again point to BCORL1 as a tumor-suppressor gene that is inactivated by mutations in a subset of AML.
Test_Line_10142 The mononuclear cells from BM samples were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (1.077 g/ml; cryofetal bovine; Amersham Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, UK) and preserved in 10% dimethylsulfoxide and 20% serum at -70--Degree--C or in liquid nitrogen until test.
Test_Line_10143 Patients who receive high-dose cytarabine should be closely monitored for changes in renal function, because renal dysfunction is highly correlated with increased risk of cerebellar toxicity.
Test_Line_10144 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_10145 AT A GLANCE.
Test_Line_10146 A subsequent study of 489 AML samples also found that DNMT3A mutations conferred poor prognosis and decreased overall survival.
Test_Line_10147 Patients with > 5% myeloblasts constituted those with advanced disease.
Test_Line_10148 As an international collaborative effort, we are currently analyzing clinical, hematologic, and molecular data of a large population of PMF patients with the aim of developing a clinically useful prognostic tool.
Test_Line_10149 Thirty-five percent of patients who received a low dose and 59% who received a high dose showed >50% reduction in splenomegaly overall.
Test_Line_10150 Results of MPL assays should be reported in a similar fashion as those described above for JAK2.
Test_Line_10151 We did not find a difference in the risk of AML transformation between CMML1 and CMML2 (P = 0.146).
Test_Line_10152 Two patients had biallelic heterozygous mutations.
Test_Line_10153 In addition, they indicate that PMF genotypes should now be considered also in designing clinical trials on the use of novel drugs for treatment of PMF.

Test_Line_10161 Further work is crucial to validate this finding and to identify genetic targets of EZH2 loss-of-function.
Test_Line_10162 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_10163 NPM1 mutations can occur concurrently with FLT3-ITD, and patients who have both genetic lesions have an outcome more similar to those with isolated FLT3-ITD mutations.
Test_Line_10164 INCB018424 is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, and phase I/II studies involved 153 patients with PMF or post-PV/ET MF, 34 patients with PV, and 39 with ET.
Test_Line_10165 Indeed, U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations were associated with worse survival in CMML and low-risk MDS, respectively.
Test_Line_10166 Five patients had frameshift mutations, one at RHD and four in the C-terminal part, all generating termination codons within the 3' -untranslated region.
Test_Line_10167 EZH2 encodes the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, a highly conserved histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase that influences stem cell renewal by epigenetic modification.
Test_Line_10168 Dosing should aim to decrease platelets below 400 x 109/L and maintain leukocytes above 2 x 109/L.
Test_Line_10169 The spectrum of GATA2 mutations in MDS/AML, Emberger, or MonoMAC syndrome patients is large.
Test_Line_10170 Genotype-phenotype association.
Test_Line_10171 Several groups have generated mouse models of TET2 loss, and in each study to date TET2 loss resulted in disruption of haematopoietic differentiation with progressive expansion of the lineage- SCA1+ KIT+ (LSK) population, which includes HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells.
Test_Line_10172 Patient population BM aspirates or blood samples were collected from 315 patients with MDS (n = 88), MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPNs; n = 66), MPN (n = 52), secondary AML (sAML; n = 54) that evolved from these conditions and primary AML (pAML; n = 55) seen at Cleveland Clinic or Nagoya University between 2003 and 2010 (Table 1).
Test_Line_10173 Although obtaining a remission is the first step in controlling the disease, it is also important for patients to emerge from the induction phase in a condition to tolerate subsequent, more intensive treatments during consolidation to achieve durable disease control.
Test_Line_10174 A total of 617 patients with PMF were recruited from 4 centers: 187 from the Department of Hematology Oncology and 171 from the Center for the Study of Myelofibrosis (Pavia, Italy), 163 from the University Hospital (Florence, Italy), and 96 from the Hospital Clinic (Barcelona, Spain).
Test_Line_10175 Nested PCR was carried out using primers flanking the full coding sequence of the PTEN/MMAC1 cDNA, as shown in Table I.
Test_Line_10176 However, in CN-AML patients, in patients with mutated NPM1, and in the NPM1 mutated/FLT3 wild-type subgroup of patients, cohesin mutations had no impact on outcome.
Test_Line_10177 This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (Comitato di Bioetica, Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico [IRCCS] Policlinico, San Matteo, Pavia, Italy), and by the institutional review boards of the remaining centers.
Test_Line_10178 Highly sensitive qPCR for JAK2 V617F may have value in followup of patients with primary and secondary myelofibrosis after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.
Test_Line_10179 Direct Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing has been used for assessment of JAK2 and MPL mutations.
Test_Line_10180 The proportion of patients with a reduction of 35% or more in spleen volume at week 24 (primary end point) was 41.9% in the ruxolitinib group as compared with 0.7% in the placebo group (odds ratio, 134.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18.0 to 1004.9; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A).

(A) OS of the whole population of PMF patients: the genetic basis of MPNs was unknown before 2005, and therefore no genotypic subgroup could be defined. (B) PMF patients stratified according to JAK2 or MPL mutation status: these mutant genes where identified in 2005 and 2006, respectively. (C) PMF patients stratified according to JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation status: somatic mutations of calreticulin were identified in 2013.
Test_Line_10183 The main genes involved in congenital neutropenia were characterized during the last decade, with ELANE being involved in half of them (for review, see Donadieu et al).
Test_Line_10184 The familial segregation of the GATA2 R396Q mutation (GATA2 gene location according to hg19, chr3:128.2 Mb) in pedigree 1 was investigated using 4 highly polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs), 2 of which were centromeric to GATA2 (D3S3606 and D3S3607, located at chr3:127.2 Mb and chr3:127.3 Mb, respectively) and 2 of which were telomeric to GATA2 (D3S1587 and D3S1292 located at chr3:130.8 Mb and chr3:131.6 Mb, respectively).
Test_Line_10185 All patients were followed up until death or for up to 88 months.

Test_Line_10188 Splicing factor mutations in myelodysplasia.
Test_Line_10189 The father (patient number 7106; P4, II, 2) has the same mutation.
Test_Line_10190 This consolidation therapy is based on a CALGB trial comparing 100 mg/m2, 400 mg/m2, and 3 g/m2 doses of cytarabine.
Test_Line_10191 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.
Test_Line_10192 The discovery of high-frequency CSF3R mutations in CNL, and to a lesser extent in aCML, identifies a new major diagnostic criterion for these diseases and suggests a close relationship between these neutrophilic leukemias.
Test_Line_10193 Mutation of R882 occurred in nearly 60% of the DNMT3A-mutant samples (37 of 62 mutations) and has been shown to decrease catalytic activity and DNA binding affinity.
Test_Line_10194 Mutations in PTEN/MMAC1 are most frequently found in advanced cancers.
Test_Line_10195 In 2 large observational studies, therapy with hydroxyurea was not shown to contribute to an increased rate of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome in patients with PV or ET.
Test_Line_10196 To avoid any misunderstanding, we included information as to which cases were analyzed by whole exome sequencing in supplemental Table 2.
Test_Line_10197 Other.
Test_Line_10198 At least part of the difference is likely due to the fact that, in the Mayo Clinic study, OS was estimated from the date of diagnosis or first referral, whereas in this study it was always estimated from the date of diagnosis.
Test_Line_10199 RUNX1 and CEBPA were not mutated in any member of this family (data not shown).
Test_Line_10200 Compared with the very-low-risk category, the estimated HR were 4.2 (95% CI, 1.4-12, P = .007) for the low risk, 10.2 (95% CI, 3.6-28.6, P <.001) for the intermediate risk, 37.5 (95% CI, 13.3-105.8, P <.001) for the high risk, and 88.6 (95% CI, 30.3-259, P <.001) for the very-high-risk category.
Test_Line_10201 Single-agent use of any of these drugs have comparable response rates of approximately 20% that last 1-2 years.
Test_Line_10202 The loss of function for PTEN/MMAC1 appears to occur during the progression of multiple human cancers. PTEN/MMAC1 has also been identified as the gene responsible for Cowden disease, a rare familial syndrome associated with an elevated risk for tumors of the breast, thyroid, and skin, and BannayanZonana syndrome, a related harmartomatous polyposis syndrome.
Test_Line_10203 In a large SWOG study, patients younger than 65 years (N = 665) were randomized to receive high-dose cytarabine (2 g/m2 every 12 hours x 6 days for a total of 24 g/m2; patients aged < 50 years were initially randomized to receive 3 g/m2 at the above schedule before the high-dose arm was redefined to 2 g/m2 because of toxicity concerns) or standard-dose cytarabine (200 mg/m2/d x 7 days); patients in both treatment arms also received daunorubicin (45 mg/m2/d x 3 days).
Test_Line_10204 However, in another recent study, IDH2 mutation (restricted to IDH2-R140) was associated with improved survival among the overall study population, and among the subgroup of patients with favorable risk (intermediate-risk AML with NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD).
Test_Line_10205 The role of TET2 in the classification of MPN is limited because TET2 mutations have been identified in most other myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_10206 Using mass-spectrometric genotyping, we examined these samples for 953 recurrent mutations in 111 cancer-associated genes.
Test_Line_10207 Finally, PRC2-mediated transcriptional repression has also recently been identified as an important pathogenic event in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL).
Test_Line_10208 Various somatic mutations are involved in the pathogenesis of MDS.
Test_Line_10209 A few gene mutations are highly specific to MDS or myelodysplasia, whereas a number of chimeric genes and other mutations, including those in MPN1 and CEBPA, are highly specific to AML.
Test_Line_10210 However, the strategies leading to the discovery of BCOR and BCORL1 mutations in AML differed.
Test_Line_10211 Grade 4 episodes of bleeding occurred in 1.3% of patients who received ruxolitinib and in 1.3% of patients who received placebo.
Test_Line_10212 She presented with aspergillosis during induction therapy and received several lines of chemotherapy because of a refractory disease.
Test_Line_10213 Thus, for this subgroup of patients, high-dose cytarabine followed by autologous HSCT should be the preferred HSCT option, and allogeneic HSCT may be better reserved as salvage therapy or for those with c-KIT mutations.
Test_Line_10214 We have performed deep sequencing of mRNA in hematopoietic cells derived from mutant cases and compared the results obtained in cells with a corresponding WT form of the gene.
Test_Line_10215 V Grossmann; A Kohlmann; C Eder; C Haferlach; W Kern; NCP Cross; T Haferlach; S Schnittger.
Test_Line_10216 However, based on the substantial difference in relapse-free survival data between the Intermediate I and Intermediate II groups defined by ELN, the NCCN has continued to place NK-AML with FLT3-ITD mutations in the unfavorable risk group rather than the intermediate risk group (see "Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities," on page 995).
Test_Line_10217 Frequencies and patterns of RUNX1 mutations in patients with CMML.
Test_Line_10218 However, phlebotomy is still recommended with current guidelines that suggest an Hct target of <50%.
Test_Line_10219 This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at 89 sites in the United States, Australia, and Canada.
Test_Line_10220 The lymphocyte count was also low, with a median at 1.1 G/L (25th percentile: 1.0; 75th percentile: 1.7); with B cells and NK cells were also low.
Test_Line_10221 Pairwise comparisons of variables were performed for exploratory purposes using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Student t test for continuous variables and the x-squared test for categorical variables.
Test_Line_10222 Additional exon 12 mutations have been reported, but their clinical significance is unknown.
Test_Line_10223 When 310 patients genotyped for these mutations were analyzed, the presence of SF3B1 mutations was associated with longer survival and U2AF1 mutations with shorter survival, whereas SRSF2 mutations had no effect on survival.
Test_Line_10224 Cytogenetic and molecular analysis.
Test_Line_10225 The sponsor, in collaboration with the academic investigators, interpreted the data.
Test_Line_10226 The MPL gene maps to chromosome band 1p34 and encodes the thrombopoietin receptor, which binds to thrombopoietin, the primary cytokine that regulates megakaryocyte development and platelet production, as well as hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis.
Test_Line_10227 Adverse events of grade 3 or higher developed in 8 of 49 patients in the ruxolitinib group (16.3%) and in 7 of 54 patients in the placebo group (13.0%) after interruption of the study drug and in 12 of 21 patients in the ruxolitinib group (57.1%) and 17 of 37 patients in the placebo group (45.9%) after discontinuation.
Test_Line_10228 In practice, however, clinicians find it easier to order both the BCR-ABL1 and the JAK2 assays at the same time in screening peripheral blood.
Test_Line_10229 Unlike granulocyte isolation, optimization in a PCR procedure does not increase time, labor, or cost on a routine basis.
Test_Line_10230 Similarly, in a retrospective review of adult patients with AML treated on CALGB protocols (N = 1213), the 5-year survival rates for those with favorable, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk cytogenetics were 55%, 24%, and 5%, respectively.
Test_Line_10231 Higher analytical sensitivity may be achieved by using clamped PCR, followed by nucleotide sequencing.
Test_Line_10232 Table 2. Clinical characteristics of patients treated with HMAs.
Test_Line_10233 Induction therapy with high-dose cytarabine was associated with significantly higher rates of treatment-related mortality (14% vs. 5% for patients age < 50 years; 20% vs. 12% for patients age 50-64 years; P = .003) and grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicity (8% vs. 2% for patients < 50 years; 5% vs. 0.5% for patients age 50-64 years; P < .0001).
Test_Line_10234 Four patients were identified with missense mutations in SMC3 and 1 patient with the stop codon being changed to leucine (Figure 1 and supplemental Table 4).
Test_Line_10235 Recent studies have also identified subclonal mutations in genes like ASXL1, SRSF2, EZH2, IDH1, and IDH2, which are commonly associated with disease progression and identify PMF patients at high risk for leukemic transformation or premature death.
Test_Line_10236 We then examined whether the mutation status for each gene was associated with clinical variables, including specific cytopenias, the proportion of blasts, and overall survival.
Test_Line_10237 In addition, they do not carry JAK2 (V617F), which is instead found in two-thirds of PMF patients.
Test_Line_10238 The PRC2 complex consists of four core members: EZH1 or EZH2, embryonic ectoderm development (EED), suppressor of zeste 12 homologue (SUZ12) and RBAP48 (also known as RBBP4) (reviewed recently 61).
Test_Line_10239 A deficit of monocytes, B cells, and NK cells was detected, the T-cell count remained normal (Table 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_10240 TET2 and DNA hydroxymethylation.
Test_Line_10241 The expanded sample size of our cohort also enabled precise analysis of clinical associations.
Test_Line_10242 Patients with STAG2/RAD21 mutations were more likely to respond to treatment with HMAs compared with WT cases (79% vs 47%; P = .04) and were comparable in age and IPSS scores with the nonresponders.
Test_Line_10243 Through the whole exome sequencing of nine cases with low risk MDS, of which eight were MDS with ring sideroblasts, Papaemmanuil et al identified SF3B1 mutations in six cases and in a subsequent large-scale mutation analysis, confirmed the high frequency of SF3B1 mutations in MDS (72/354; 20 %), which were rare in other myeloid neoplasms, including AML (3/57; 5 %), CML (0/53), and MPNs (12/420, 3 %).
Test_Line_10244 As expected, in sAML and pAML, because of overall poor prognosis, the presence of spliceosomal mutations did not further affect survival (supplemental Figure 4).
Test_Line_10245 The study design adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our institutional review board before its initiation.
Test_Line_10246 The most common of these include mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 genes, which encode for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2, respectively, and mutations in DNMT3A, which encode for DNA methyltransferase 3A.
Test_Line_10247 As reference standards for quantitative JAK2 testing are made available, comparable results across laboratories can be achieved in monitoring treatment response and minimal residual disease.
Test_Line_10248 The cytogenetic risk categories adopted by these guidelines are primarily based on analyses of large datasets from major cooperative group trials (see "Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities," page 995).
Test_Line_10249 Adverse effects were reported in 89% of patients, and treatment was stopped in 24% due to toxicity.
Test_Line_10250 In this latter subgroup, presence of IDH1 or mutations was associated with significantly increased 3-year OS rate compared with patients with NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD and without IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (89% vs. 31%; P < .0001).
Test_Line_10251 This Special Article summarizes results from a nationwide laboratory survey of JAK2 and MPL mutation analysis.
Test_Line_10252 A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Ruxolitinib for Myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_10253 On the opposite, triple-negative patients were older, had lower hemoglobin level, lower platelet count, and higher IPSS risk (P values in Table 1).
Test_Line_10254 All SF3B1 mutations were located in exon 14 or 15, with the K700 mutation being the most recurrent (Figure 1B).
Test_Line_10255 The CALGB trial also included maintenance chemotherapy following the consolidation phase; however, not all patients in remission received maintenance (55% of patients in CR) following high-dose cytarabine consolidation.
Test_Line_10256 The estimated 2-year AML transformation free was 21% for mutation-positive patients and 55% for mutationnegative patients.
Test_Line_10257 Details of the modeling strategy are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.
Test_Line_10258 The initial evaluation of AML has 2 objectives.
Test_Line_10259 (Ipsogen became Qiagen Marseille in 2013.)
Test_Line_10260 GATA2 might be this putative mutator gene suggested by Minelli et al GATA2 mutation could act as a preleukemic event followed by an overt transformation due to the loss of genes located in the long arm of chromosome 7.
Test_Line_10261 The primary end point was the proportion of patients with a reduction of 35% or more in spleen volume from baseline to week 24, measured by means of magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography.
Test_Line_10262 In univariate analysis, CALR-mutant patients had a better OS than JAK2-mutant (hazard ratio [HR] 2.3, P <.001), MPL-mutant (HR 2.6, P = .009), and triple-negative patients (HR 6.2, P <.001).
Test_Line_10263 Although patients older than 75 years with significant comorbidities generally do not benefit from conventional chemotherapy treatment, the rare patient with favorable or normal karyotype and no significant comorbidities might be the exception to this dogma.
Test_Line_10264 Among patients with MDS/MPN, SF3B1 mutations were not common in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), but they were frequent in patients with RARS-T; thus, the presence of RS was found to correlate highly with SF3B1 mutations, irrespective of other clinical or morphologic features (Figure 2A).
Test_Line_10265 A screening assay may be warranted in patients with thrombocytosis >1000 x 109/L because the risk of acquired von Willebrand syndrome increases with increasing platelets levels.
Test_Line_10266 This review will focus on the latest developments in the molecular biology, diagnosis, and treatment of classic BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs.
Test_Line_10267 Treatment of acute leukemia has been divided into induction chemotherapy and postremission (or consolidation) therapy.
Test_Line_10268 The contamination was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis after magnetic bead sorting.
Test_Line_10269 In a study using direct sequencing, lower frequencies of the JAK2 V617F were found in all three classical MPN entities: 65% in PV, 23% in ET, and 30% in PMF.
Test_Line_10270 Among all patients who received consolidation with high-dose cytarabine, the rates of treatment-related deaths and serious neurotoxicity were 5% and 12%, respectively.
Test_Line_10271 Although the initial report did not break down remission duration by cytogenetic groups, subsequent analysis showed a 5-year relapse-free survival (continuous CR measured from time of randomization) rate of 50% for CBF AML, 32% for patients with normal karyotype, and 15% for patients in other cytogenetic categories, overall (P < .001).

Test_Line_10273 Methods.
Test_Line_10274 Mutations of BCOR mainly clustered with CN-AML, were virtually mutually exclusive with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations and showed an association with DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_10275 Direct sequencing of the aberrant band showed an insertion of 4 bases (CCCG) at nt 1423 of exon 5 (Fig. 3B).
Test_Line_10276 With the availability of a broad selection of test methods, laboratories may find it challenging to select the methodology and platform most suitable for their practice.
Test_Line_10277 Diagnosis was confirmed at each institution according to World Health Organization classification criteria.
Test_Line_10278 The PCR amplification was performed in a volume of 25 muL containing 0.5 mug of genomic DNA, 2.5 pmol each of the primers, 5 muCi 35SdATP, 0.2 mM each of dNTPs, 1.25U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, and 1x PCR buffer.
Test_Line_10279 In a multivariable Cox regression model, the presence of mutations in five genes retained independent prognostic significance: TP53 (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.60 to 3.84), EZH2 (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.33), ETV6 (hazard ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.08 to 3.86), RUNX1 (hazard ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.15), and ASXL1 (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.89).
Test_Line_10280 Although variations exist between institutional standards and practices, several supportive care issues are important to consider in the management of patients with AML.
Test_Line_10281 Patients with RUNX1 mutations had a trend of increased risk of AML transformation compared with that in mutation-negative patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.
Test_Line_10282 Thirty-six patients in the placebo group (23.4%) crossed over to ruxolitinib (16 before and 20 after week 24; see the Supplementary Appendix.)
Test_Line_10283 These data are underscored by recent studies which suggest that alterations in these pathways have prognostic relevance in MDS and AML.
Test_Line_10284 Similarly, all mutations in SRSF2 affected position P95 (Figure 1D).
Test_Line_10285 These truncated receptors may also lack the binding site for suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, which reduces trafficking of CSF3R to the lysosome.
Test_Line_10286 RESULTS.
Test_Line_10287 Risk of development of anemia, thrombocytopenia, marked leukocytosis, and large splenomegaly during the clinical course according to JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status.
Test_Line_10288 Gene set enrichment analysis of expression data from DNMT3A-mutant compared with DNMT3A-wild-type AML patient samples identified altered expression of genes in key metabolic and apoptosis pathways.
Test_Line_10289 These likely include patient genetic background, characteristics of the distinct CSF3R mutation (eg, hematopoietic cell of origin, allele burden, activation of distinct signaling cascades), and the accompanying clonal architecture of these neoplasms (eg, mutations of SETBP1, JAK2 V617F, or other genes).
Test_Line_10290 It may be difficult to accumulate JAK2 exon 12 or MPL mutant cases for validation, given the low frequency of these variants.
Test_Line_10291 In summary, cohesin mutations, which likely result in loss of function, are recurrent molecular genetic events in both solid and hematopoietic tumors.
Test_Line_10292 She developed a disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection and later an AML M4 subtype.
Test_Line_10293 Thus, there is a functional convergence of diverse spliceosomal mutations toward effects on specific genes, a phenomenon that explains the similar phenotypes of some of the different mutations.
Test_Line_10294 In a literature review of 40 patients meeting WHO criteria for true CNL, the median survival was 23.5 months (range, 1-106 months).
Test_Line_10295 Routine screening LPs are not warranted at the time of diagnosis in patients with AML.
Test_Line_10296 The 16 specimens having a high rate of false-negative results tended to have lower JAK2 allele burden in those laboratories doing quantitative assays, suggesting that the false-negative results were mostly due to assays with lower analytical sensitivity.
Test_Line_10297 In addition, two recent reports found that the (R)-enantiomer of 2-HG ((R)-2HG) may actually serve as a cofactor for the activation of the EGLN family of prolyl hydroxylases (EGLN1-3).
Test_Line_10298 The improvement was rapid and was maintained over the 24-week period during which symptom data were collected (Fig. 2A).
Test_Line_10299 The age of patients with mutations was younger than those without mutations (mean+=s.e. 66.3+=24 years vs 71.5+=1.6 years, P = 0.055).
Test_Line_10300 In support of this possibility, we found that both patients harbor heterozygous mutation of GATA2.
Test_Line_10301 The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are characterized by clonal hematopoiesis, a variety of chromosomal abnormalities, bone marrow (BM) failure, and a propensity for evolution to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Test_Line_10302 It contains three critical domains: JH1, JH2, and four-pointone, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) homolog domains.
Test_Line_10303 To understand the role of these mutations in MDS pathogenesis, the effects of the mutant alleles on RNA splicing should be evaluated in more physiological conditions using primary hematopoietic cells.
Test_Line_10304 Additional prespecified analyses showed that among the patients for whom baseline and week 24 data were available, the 129 patients receiving ruxolitinib had a mean improvement of 46.1% (median, 56.2%) in the total symptom score at week 24; the 103 patients receiving placebo had a mean worsening of 41.8% (median, 14.6%) in the score (P<0.001).
Test_Line_10305 Cohesin mutations were significantly associated with RUNX1, Ras-family oncogenes, and BCOR and ASXL1 mutations and were most prevalent in high-risk MDS and secondary AML.

(A) Abnormal transcripts are noted in AML patients (cases 10, 22, 24, 35, and 72) and normal controls (N6, N7, N10, N16). (B) Abnormal transcripts in cell lines. Lane 1, U937; lane 2, Raji; lane 3, HL60; lane 4, KG-1; lane 5, K562. M represents pGem marker.
Test_Line_10307 SETBP1 is mutated at lower frequencies in unclassified MDS/MPN (10%) and CMML (4%), but no SETBP1 mutations are found in AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or solid tumors.
Test_Line_10308 There is no difference in analytical performance using peripheral blood or bone marrow samples for testing for JAK2 mutations, because granulocytes constitute the predominant population in both specimens.
Test_Line_10309 First, whole exome assembly was nonredundantly mapped with the reference genome hg19.
Test_Line_10310 The mean coverage of all amplicons was 2484 reads per amplicon.
Test_Line_10311 In a European trial that compared idarubicin 12 mg/m2 x 3 or 4 days versus daunorubicin 80 mg/m x 3 days in patients between ages 50 and 70 years, CR rates were 83% and 70%, respectively (P = .024).
Test_Line_10312 PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel, gel-purified with a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced in both directions with BigDye Terminators v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kits on an automated ABI PRISM 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Test_Line_10313 Cohesin is a multiprotein complex that has an established role as an effector of sister-chromatid cohesin during metaphase.
Test_Line_10314 Cohesin mutations likely represent secondary events in clonal hierarchy and contribute to clonal transformation.
Test_Line_10315 To date, mutation or alterations in expression of EZH1 have not been found in human malignancies.
Test_Line_10316 Within "lower-risk" subjects (Figure 5A), CALR-mutant patients had a better OS compared with either JAK2 (V617F)-mutant (P = .011) or triple-negative patients (P <.001).
Test_Line_10317 Rare mutations in TET2, ASXL1, IDH1/IDH2, EZH2, DNMT3A, and CBL have been described, although the precise roles of these mutations in the pathogenesis of ET and PMF are unknown.
Test_Line_10318 The presence of hot spots and the absence of nonsense or frameshift changes strongly suggested that they could be associated with some gain of function rather than represented simple loss of functions.
Test_Line_10319 There are no standard methods for detecting the rare JAK2 mutations, nor for MPL mutations.
Test_Line_10320 The mutations consisted of 9 missense, 1 silent, 7 nonsense and 15 frameshift mutations.
Test_Line_10321 In patients with both anemia and splenomegaly, erythropoietin stimulating agents are not recommended because increased extramedullary hematopoesis can lead to worsening splenomegaly.
Test_Line_10322 Whole exome sequencing.
Test_Line_10323 Ultimately, comparison of TKI-treated patients to historical controls will help determine whether these therapies impact disease endpoints such as leukemia-free progression and overall survival.
Test_Line_10324 GATA2 mutation screening.
Test_Line_10325 In the aforementioned EORTC/GIMEMA trial, a 43% 4-year DFS rate was reported in the donor group of patients with poor-risk cytogenetics (n = 64; 73% underwent HSCT); this was significantly higher than the 4-year DFS rate (18%; P = .008) among the no-donor group (n = 94; 46% underwent HSCT), although only approximately half of the patients were able to proceed with the planned HSCT in the no-donor group.
Test_Line_10326 Use of both the HpaII tiny fragment enrichment by ligation-mediated PCR assay (HELP assay) and LC-MS to detect global levels of DNA methylation in AML patient samples with TET2 mutations revealed hypermethylation as well as lower global 5-hmC levels.
Test_Line_10327 In keeping with the prominent role of G-CSF in the production of neutrophils, deletion of CSF3R leads to neutropenia in mouse models.
Test_Line_10328 In line with other studies, cohesin mutations were not associated with an increase in the frequency of complex cytogenetic abnormalities.
Test_Line_10329 KEY POINTS.
Test_Line_10330 The changes in the total symptom score among patients with the JAK2V617F mutation were -52.6% (improvement) in the ruxolitinib group and 42.8% (worsening) in the placebo group, and the changes among those without the mutation were -28.1% and 37.2%, respectively (P = 0.11 for interaction).
Test_Line_10331 The discovery of recurrent somatic mutations in various genes encoding spliceosomal proteins indicates that spliceosomal defects constitute an important and ubiquitous pathway in malignant transformation.
Test_Line_10332 Truncated CSF3R may lack the di-leucine internalization motif, resulting in an increase in cell surface expression of the receptor.
Test_Line_10333 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_10334 Adverse effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a rapid return of symptoms after discontinuation of therapy.
Test_Line_10335 PATIENTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS.
Test_Line_10336 Genotyping of 953 mutations representing 111 genes was performed on amplified DNA with the use of iPlex extension-chemistry methods (Sequenom) and mass spectrometry, as previously described for the complete set of OncoMap assays.
Test_Line_10337 Mutations in ASXL1 and EZH2 had associations with clinical phenotypes, including overall survival, that differed from those of TET2 mutations, suggesting that these genes drive distinct and additive aspects of cellular transformation to myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_10338 The former had a lower AIC value (1744.5 vs 1764.3), indicating a better quality for the given set of data.
Test_Line_10339 Metaphase cytogenetics details were retrieved from 892 patients.
Test_Line_10340 In our analysis, the allelelic burden of mutations in the cohesin genes were very similar to that observed for NPM1 mutations.
Test_Line_10341 In both diseases, trisomy 8 and del (20q) are the most common nonspecific chromosomal abnormalities observed at diagnosis or at the time of progressive disease.
Test_Line_10342 Affymetrix 250K and 6.0 Kit (Affymetrix) were used.
Test_Line_10343 Statistical analyses.
Test_Line_10344 The different genetic subtypes of PMF should also be considered in designing clinical trials on the use of novel drugs.
Test_Line_10345 Secondary efficacy variables were tested in a fixed-sequence testing procedure at an alpha level of 0.05.
Test_Line_10346 For the secondary end point of overall survival, at the time of data cutoff, 10 deaths were reported in the ruxolitinib group (6.5%) as compared with 14 deaths in the placebo group (9.1%) (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.30 to 1.50; P = 0.33).
Test_Line_10347 We propose limiting the use of hematopoietic growth factors and implementing intensive treatment such as allograft in patients with neutropenia and GATA2 mutations as soon as an unrelated donor has been identified.
Test_Line_10348 Sensitivity analyses were performed on CR and RFS, and results are displayed for exploratory purposes.
Test_Line_10349 Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by abnormal proliferation of megakaryocytes, deposition of fibrous connective tissues in the bone marrow, abnormal stem cell trafficking, and extramedullary hematopoiesis (myeloid metaplasia).
Test_Line_10350 Her brother and parents are healthy.
Test_Line_10351 Figure 6. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of PMF patients stratified according to the risk categories defined by a clinical-molecular prognostic model. This model includes the variables reported in Table 2, that is, IPSS variables plus CALR, JAK2, and MPL mutation status. We assigned each factor an integer weight according to the corresponding HR in the multivariable-Cox regression of Table 2. Scores were then recoded into the 5 risk categories shown in this figure: details are reported in the last section of "Results." Based on the Akaike information criterion, which compares quality of models, the clinical-molecular model provided a better stratification than the IPSS. This analysis serves as a proof of concept that accounting for driver mutations improves the risk stratification provided by IPSS.
Test_Line_10352 Inhibition of Janus kinase 2 or SRC kinase signaling downstream of mutated CSF3R is feasible and should be explored therapeutically.
Test_Line_10353 A group of clonal myeloid disorders that involve precursor cells with a reduced capacity to differentiate into more mature cellular elements and with increased proliferation and self-renewal.
Test_Line_10354 These adverse events were manageable, as evidenced by the low discontinuation rate (one patient in each group for each event).
Test_Line_10355 Our clinical trial protocol allowed an intent-to-treat analysis on the basis of donor availability in patients with CN-AML.
Test_Line_10356 Somatic mutations in other cohesin genes (SMC1A, PDS5B, WAPAL, MAU2, REC8, NIPBL, SMC5, and ESCO2) were present in <.% of our cohort (Figure 1 and supplemental Tables 2-4).
Test_Line_10357 In all analyses, P-values were two-tailed and values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Test_Line_10358 Using an enhanced sequence-specific approach to examine methylation status, IDH-mutant AMLs were found to have a unique methylation profile that is distinct from AMLs arising from MLL translocations.
Test_Line_10359 Insensitive molecular assays would cause an even bigger problem in ET, in which up to 75% of cases have a JAK2 V617F level of less than 25% and a considerable number (40% of cases) have a JAK2 V617F level of less than 10%.
Test_Line_10360 Time to large splenomegaly could be estimated only in patients from the Pavia Center for the Study of Myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_10361 Sample preparations and hybridizations were performed using Genome-wide Human SNP Nsp/Sty and CytoScan assay kits (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Test_Line_10362 Epigenetics refers to heritable DNA-sequence-independent processes that regulate gene expression.
Test_Line_10363 Survival ranges from approximately 2 to 11 years, depending on defined prognostic factors.
Test_Line_10364 Even with this "low-intensity" treatment approach, induction death occurred in 26% of patients, and overall prognosis remained poor for older patients who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy regimens.
Test_Line_10365 At least one mutation was present in 226 of the 439 samples (51.5%). (Missense mutations of KDM6A were found in three samples, but the mutations could not be confirmed as somatic and are not included in the totals listed above.)
Test_Line_10366 CpG islands contain a high concentration of CpG sites and are frequently near promoter regions.
Test_Line_10367 Three AML cases with cohesin mutations (SMC3, STAG2, and RAD21) at diagnosis achieved remission with cytarabine and idarubicin treatment.
Test_Line_10368 Harada et al. observed that N-terminal mutations were highly associated with therapy-related MDS, whereas C-terminal mutations of RUNX1 preferentially occurred in de novo high-risk MDS or AML after antecedent de novo MDS.
Test_Line_10369 Further study will be needed to clarify these possibilities and to understand how different genotypic combinations of leukaemia-associated disease alleles result in biologically, therapeutically and prognostically distinct myeloid leukaemia phenotypes.
Test_Line_10370 In an Australian Leukemia Study Group trial, patients younger than 60 years were randomized (N = 301) to receive either high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 for a total of 24 g/m2) or standard cytarabine therapy (100 mg/m2/d x 7 days via continuous infusion); patients in both arms received daunorubicin (50 mg/m2 on days 1-3) and etoposide (75 mg/m2/d x 7 days).
Test_Line_10371 A group of proteins that function in histone-modifiying complexes to activate gene expression by inducing trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) at specific sites in chromatin that are recognized by the complex.
Test_Line_10372 Our sequence library for deep sequencing was generated by TruSeqCustom Amplicon (Illumina).
Test_Line_10373 Traditional Sanger sequencing has been used extensively, but it has relatively poor sensitivity.
Test_Line_10374 Moreover, spliceosome-associated gene mutations were screened with whole exome sequencing results available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (National Cancer Institute).
Test_Line_10375 Examination of the blood and the BM revealed a refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia.
Test_Line_10376 Treatment with antimetabolites, such as the purine analog fludarabine, has also been associated with therapy-related MDS/AML in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly when administered in combination with alkylating agents.
Test_Line_10377 His elder brother (patient number 6165; P1, III, 2), 16 years of age, also had a history of chronic neutropenia with a chronic EBV replication in the gut and a severe respiratory distress syndrome requiring supplemental oxygen at age 14 linked to pulmonary bronchiectasis.
Test_Line_10378 ASXL1, additional sex combs-like 1; DNMT3A, DNA methyltransferase 3A; EZH2, enhancer of zeste homologue 2; NA, data have not been reported.
Test_Line_10379 Figure 3. Cumulative incidence of leukemic transformation in PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation. Vertical tick marks indicate right-censored patients. Triple-negative patients had higher incidence of leukemic transformation compared with both CALR-mutant and JAK2-mutant patients (maximum P value equal to .043).
Test_Line_10380 In the ruxolitinib group, 62.7% of patients with a reduction in spleen volume of 35% or more had improvement of 50% or more in spleen-related symptoms (as indicated by the sum of MFSAF scores for abdominal discomfort, pain under the ribs on the left side, and a feeling of fullness [early satiety]); however, this level of improvement also occurred in 46.9% of patients with a reduction in spleen volume of less than 35%.
Test_Line_10381 The study was designed to enroll 240 patients, providing 97% power to detect a treatment difference in spleen-volume response at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, assuming a response rate of 30% or more for ruxolitinib and a response rate of 10% or less for placebo.
Test_Line_10382 Statistical analysis.
Test_Line_10383 Largely specific to myelodysplastic phenotypes, these splicing factor mutations provide a potential clue to better understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS.
Test_Line_10384 In addition, one laboratory provided formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of spleen from a patient with polycythemia vera.
Test_Line_10385 The methodology summary should include source information regarding any commercial primers and probes used, and it must include a statement of assay sensitivity.
Test_Line_10386 Bone marrow evaluation is recommended only if the hemogram becomes abnormal, rather than as routine surveillance at fixed intervals, unless this is being performed as part of a clinical research protocol.
Test_Line_10387 Low-dose cytarabine resulted in a CR rate of 18% (vs. 1% with hydroxyurea) and a survival benefit compared with hydroxyurea in patients with favorable or normal karyotype.
Test_Line_10388 The analysis of overall survival was updated at the time of a planned data-collection cutoff 4 months after the primary analysis.
Test_Line_10389 CSF3R and SETBP1 mutational overlap.
Test_Line_10390 MOLECULAR BIOLOGY.
Test_Line_10391 Epigenetic modifications have long been known to govern genetic programming and cellular differentiation.
Test_Line_10392 Facing a patient with PMF, his or her genetic lesion must now be taken into account carefully because this has an impact on clinical decision-making.
Test_Line_10393 Limitations of the Ipsogen qualitative assay (MutaScreen assay) were highlighted in a report that described two MPNs containing variant JAK2 mutations, each with the typical codon 617 (1849G>T) mutation, and in one case an additional codon 617 (1851C>T) substitution and a codon 618 (1852T>C) mutation, and in the other case an additional codon 618 (1853G>T) mutation.
Test_Line_10394 Karyotype was normal.
Test_Line_10395 The basis for phenotypic differences between CSF3R mutation-positive CNL and aCML may relate to multiple factors.
Test_Line_10396 Previously identified mutations, such as janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-V617F and fusion proteins involving translocation of the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene, also contribute to epigenetic modifications in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_10397 Patient number 6183 (P7, II, 1) is a young girl with an initial presentation of neutropenia evolving to MDS associated with the loss of chromosome 7 (Table 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_10398 Similarly, all mutations of SF3B1 and SRSF2 were heterozygous, and patients with somatic UPD2q33.1 or UPD17q25 (regions containing SF3B1 and SRSF2, respectively) did not harbor homozygous mutations of the associated genes.
Test_Line_10399 These tended to be low positive when tested in laboratories using quantitative assays, so it is likely that these specimens had JAK2 V617F levels that were below the limit of detection for most laboratories.
Test_Line_10400 Early studies also suggest that HOXB genes may also be important targets of DNMT3A, and the methylation of HOXB genes is altered in DNMT3A-mutant AML cells.
Test_Line_10401 Clinical phenotypes at diagnosis are reported in Table 1.
Test_Line_10402 The 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) definition of PMF includes JAK2 (V617F) or MPL (W515) mutations as a major diagnostic criterion that unequivocally proves the clonal nature of the disease.
Test_Line_10403 c-KIT mutations have been reported in approximately 20% of patients with CBF AML.
Test_Line_10404 Five mutants (nos. 26--30) with frameshift mutations located in exons 7b or 8 producing stop codons downstream of the normal termination codon 453 are expected to retain the DNA-binding potential but to lose transactivation ability, and to act as dominant negative inhibitors of wild-type RUNX1, as described by Harada et al.
Test_Line_10405 MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Test_Line_10406 In the present study, we identified GATA2 mutations as a cause of congenital mild neutropenia associated with a high risk of leukemic transformation.
Test_Line_10407 In patients with the favorable-risk CBF AML [eg, t(8;21) or inv(16)], the presence of a mutation in c-KIT significantly increased the risk of relapse.
Test_Line_10408 When considering all mutations in the cohesin complex as 1 group, OS and RFS were not influenced by the presence of cohesin mutations (OS: HR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.56-1.72; P = .94; Figure 2A) (RFS: HR 0.70; 95% CI, 0.36-1.38; P = .3, Figure 2B and Table 2).
Test_Line_10409 These distinct mechanisms may contribute to the differential downstream signaling and drug sensitivity of truncation vs membrane proximal mutations.
Test_Line_10410 RUNX1 mutations were detected in 30 of 81 CMML patients (37%) at initial diagnosis (Supplementary Figure 1).
Test_Line_10411 Table 1. Demographic and clinical features at diagnosis of 617 patients with PMF subdivided according to their genotype (JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status).
Test_Line_10412 A product with exons 4-6 missing and an insertion of 51 bp was expressed in one specimen.
Test_Line_10413 These two novel classes of epigenetic mutations probably contribute to leukaemic transformation by affecting epigenetic regulation, thus generating a chromatin landscape that can sustain, and cooperate with, the effect of class I and class II mutations.
Test_Line_10414 CSF3R is known to signal downstream through both Janus kinase (JAK) and SRC tyrosine kinase pathways, and the 2 classes of CSF3R mutations that we observed exhibit different downstream signaling and kinase inhibitor sensitivities.
Test_Line_10415 Although CSF3R truncation mutations may exhibit sensitivity to JAK kinase inhibition in the context of high concentrations of the CSF3R ligand, downstream signaling operates predominantly through SRC kinases and exhibits drug sensitivity to SRC kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib.
Test_Line_10416 Although initial studies identified metabolic alterations in samples of IDH-mutant AML and glioma, the mechanism by which these mutations contribute to malignant transformation was not known.
Test_Line_10417 All these findings point to mutational targeting of corepressors as a new mechanism of leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_10418 In conclusion, our study revealed mutations in 66/81 (81.5%) CMML patients providing new insights into the molecular heterogeneity of this disease.
Test_Line_10419 Leukemic cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow were collected from patients at diagnosis, and genomic DNA was extracted, whole genome amplified (GenomePlex whole genome amplification kit, Sigma-Aldrich, Seelze, Germany) and polymerase chain reaction amplified for 119 amplicons with not more than 5 amplicons per well using standard conditions.
Test_Line_10420 Table 6. Risk Stratification and Treatment in Primary Myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_10421 Our results showed that 72% of RUNX1 mutations in CMML were located at the N-terminal region and 28% at the C-terminal region.
Test_Line_10422 The overall survival of patients with RUNX1 mutations did not differ from those without mutations (median 15.7 months vs 12.8 months, P = 0.928, Figure 2a).
Test_Line_10423 JAK2V617F remains the best clinical marker of disease despite the identification of numerous other mutations prevalent in subsets of MPN.
Test_Line_10424 Unexpectedly, S34F U2AF35 mutant-transduced HeLa cells showed severely suppressed cell growth rather than enhanced cell proliferation, accompanied by apoptosis and G2/M arrest.
Test_Line_10425 Although, traditionally, histomorphology-based schemes have been applied to subclassify patients with MDS, this approach is unlikely to be reflective of the underlying pathogenesis.
Test_Line_10426 Reports of quantitative JAK2 V617F assays should include a statement of qualitative results (eg, JAK2 V617F mutation DETECTED), as well as a statement of quantitative allele burden.
Test_Line_10427 We performed genomewide analysis of copy-number changes in a subgroup of 75 samples, using Affymetrix 6.0 SNP arrays.
Test_Line_10428 Recently, GATA2 has been identified as a new predisposing gene for familial AML/MDS.
Test_Line_10429 It has been shown that granulocytic isolation achieves, on average, only 15% higher JAK2 allele burden compared with that of whole white blood cells.
Test_Line_10430 Staining was performed in a Gene Stain Automated Gel Stainer using PlusOne Silver Staining Kit (Pharmacia Biotech).
Test_Line_10431 Notably, most of the mutated splicing factors in MDS belong to the A complex, occurring largely in a mutually exclusive manner, strongly indicating that the common functional target of these mutations should be the 30 splice site recognition (Table 1).
Test_Line_10432 Of the 5 patients with STAG2 mutations, 2 patients were female and 3 were male.
Test_Line_10433 A 5-muL aliquot of each sample was loaded, and electrophoresis was carried out in a GenePhor Electrophoresis Unit using the GeneGel Excel 12.5/24 Kit.
Test_Line_10434 As seen from the earlier discussions, patients with NK-AML may present with multiple molecular lesions.
Test_Line_10435 In contrast, mutations of ZRSR2 on X chromosome were distributed along the entire coding region.
Test_Line_10436 This prognostic significance was observed when IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were separately analyzed, although patient numbers were small for each subgroup and statistical significance was reached only for the relapse-free survival analysis.
Test_Line_10437 Patients completed the MFSAF every night; this electronic diary was used to evaluate symptoms of night sweats, itching, abdominal discomfort, pain under the ribs on the left side, a feeling of fullness (early satiety), muscle or bone pain, and inactivity.
Test_Line_10438 Set binding protein (SETBP1) interacts with SET, a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A).
Test_Line_10439 Of special interest in our study was EZH2, that localizes to chromosome 7q36, proposed to function as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene in different diseases.
Test_Line_10440 Any clinician seeking to apply or consult the NCCN Guidelines is expected to use independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances to determine any patient's care or treatment.
Test_Line_10441 In patients who have symptomatic anemia, thalidomide or lenalidomide should be considered, although therapy may be limited by toxicity.
Test_Line_10442 These observations indicate that driver mutations define distinct disease entities within PMF.
Test_Line_10443 Molecular profiling is increasing the ability to identify mutations at the molecular level, which carry prognostic impact.
Test_Line_10444 Another hypomethylating agent, decitabine, has also been evaluated as remission induction therapy for older patients with AML.
Test_Line_10445 These findings strongly suggest that, although BCOR and BCORL1 are homologous genes, they encode for proteins that are likely to play distinctly different roles in normal human cells.
Test_Line_10446 Inclusion in the current study required the availability of demographic, clinical, and hematologic data at diagnosis (age, evaluation of constitutional symptoms, hemoglobin level, white blood cell count, and percentage of blasts in peripheral blood) that allow calculation of IPSS, and at least 1 DNA sample to assess mutation status of the 3 driver genes: JAK2, MPL, and CALR.
Test_Line_10447 Recurrent mutations in SETBP1 were recently identified in 25% of aCML patients.
Test_Line_10448 These outcomes with dose-escalated daunorubicin seemed similar to those with idarubicin (12 mg/m2 x 3 days) from the ALFA-9801 study, in which the 3-year EFS and OS rates were 30% and 40%, respectively.
Test_Line_10449 Nine of the 21 patients (43%) with N-terminal mutations had AML transformation compared with seven of nine patients with C-terminal mutations (P = 0.118).
Test_Line_10450 In addition, AML with molecular lesions such as mutated NPM1 or CEBPA genes are considered provisional entities (further information on these genetic lesions is provided later).
Test_Line_10451 Affecting at least eight components of the RNA splicing machinery, mutations were found in 130 of 228 MDS (57 %), 48 of 88 CMML (55 %) and 16 of 62 secondary AML (25.8 %) cases, but relatively rare in de novo AML (10/151; 6.6 %) and MPNs (5/53; 9.4 %).
Test_Line_10452 Additional high-dose cytarabine at this time is unlikely to induce remission in these cases.
Test_Line_10453 The resulting list of candidate SNVs was filtered with R.
Test_Line_10454 Sequencing data were analyzed with Illumina CASAVA1.7 software and the human genome reference sequence hg19.
Test_Line_10455 Patients were eligible for the study if they were 18 years of age or older and had primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis according to 2008 World Health Organization criteria, with a life expectancy of 6 months or longer, an International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) score (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) of 2 (intermediate-2 risk) or 3 or more (high risk), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3 or less (on a scale from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating greater disability; see the Supplementary Appendix for further details), less than 10% peripheral-blood blasts, an absolute peripheral-blood CD34+ cell count of more than 20x106 per liter, a platelet count of 100x109 per liter or more, and palpable splenomegaly (>=5 cm below the left costal margin).
Test_Line_10456 The median follow-up was 4.44 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.12 to 6.19), during which time 332 patients died and the data for 107 were censored at the last date they were known to be alive.

Test_Line_10459 What Are the Technical Issues Associated with JAK2 and MPL Mutation Testing?
Test_Line_10460 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_10461 This includes the discovery of the direct histone modifying activity of janus kinase 2 (JAK2), as well as identification of interactions between the fusion oncoproteins that are characteristic of APL and PcG proteins.
Test_Line_10462 In terms of understanding the effects of ASXL1 loss in vivo, Fisher et al reported the phenotype of mice with a germline gene-trap allele of Asxl1.
Test_Line_10463 Of the 617 subjects studied, 399 (64.7%) carried JAK2 (V617F), 140 (22.7%) had a CALR exon 9 indel, 25 (4.0%) carried an MPL (W515) mutation, and 53 (8.6%) had nonmutated JAK2, CALR, and MPL (so-called triple-negative PMF).
Test_Line_10464 Participation in clinical trials is especially encouraged.
Test_Line_10465 Cox models were used to identify correlates with OS.
Test_Line_10466 It is thus possible that functionally decreased expression may produce a clinical phenocopy of cohesin mutations.
Test_Line_10467 Figure 1. Schematic representation of JAK2 gene and mutation hot spots. Locations of reported mutations are indicated by colored triangles: red triangles for V617F, black triangles for other SNP mutations, and blue triangles for insertions/deletions. Representative codon numbers are marked above exon boxes. FERM, four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin domain; JH1, kinase domain; JH2, pseudokinase domain; SH2-like, SH2-like domain.
Test_Line_10468 Given the poor prognosis of these disorders, the potential applicability of JAK or SRC kinase inhibitors is an important bench-tobedside implication of the discovery of activating CSF3R mutations.
Test_Line_10469 On the other hand, the same mutation was shown to promote splicing and exon skipping of a minigene reporter in 293T cells.
Test_Line_10470 The role of TET2 in MPN was established while investigating a chromosomal rearrangement at locus 4q24 previously described in patients with AML and MDS.
Test_Line_10471 In one study, an association was found between IDH2 mutations and poorer prognosis in the subgroup of patients with NK-AML with otherwise favorable risk (NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD).
Test_Line_10472 LOH analysis in our 20 AML cases (all lacked chromosome 10 or 10q deletions) with hair follicle constitutional DNA showed that regions defined by markers D10S215, D10S541, D10S579, and AFM086 were intact in both alleles.
Test_Line_10473 This suggests that cohesin mutations may occur at a similarly early time point of leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_10474 The use of aspirin in reducing thrombotic complications in ET is less defined than for PV, because no formal clinical trials have been conducted.
Test_Line_10475 Recent observations indicate that the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway is activated in all MPNs regardless of founding driver mutations.
Test_Line_10476 These findings show that the association of some mutations with poor survival may be indirectly captured by the IPSS because of their associations with cytopenias, blast percentage, and karyotype.
Test_Line_10477 Of the 4 RAD21 mutated patients, 3 harbored a concomitant NPM1 mutation, and 1 of the 2 SMC1 mutated patients was also NPM1 mutated (supplemental Tables 2-6).
Test_Line_10478 RUNX1 mutation-positive patients were younger and had a higher BM blast percentage than did mutation-negative patients, but the difference did not reach statistical significance.
Test_Line_10479 We first analyzed the entire cohort of patients (Table 1) and determined the survival of patients in whom the 3 most common spliceosomal mutations were present.
Test_Line_10480 To provide quantitative information on the relevance of results, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) were computed.
Test_Line_10481 Mutations of the MPL gene occur in BCR-ABL1-negative MPN.
Test_Line_10482 The most frequent genetic abnormalities detected using a sensitive next-generation amplicon deep-sequencing method were found in TET2 with aberrations also seen in CBL, RUNX1 and RAS.
Test_Line_10483 Histopathologic and clinical features of CNL and aCML.
Test_Line_10484 The new risk stratification incorporating molecular data along with cytogenetics is summarized in the guidelines (see "Risk Status Based on Cytogenetics and Molecular Abnormalities," on page 995).
Test_Line_10485 The overall median survival was 25 months compared with survivals ranging from 14 to 30 months gleaned from 3 smaller studies.
Test_Line_10486 In comparison, a 10-fold to 100-fold increase in assay sensitivity can be easily achieved by designing a sensitive PCR method.
Test_Line_10487 On the contrary, despite the fact that calreticulin mutations involve high platelet counts also in PMF, the risk of thrombosis of these patients is relatively low, at least compared with that of JAK2-mutant patients.
Test_Line_10488 He had a previous history of recurrent infections and mild neutropenia.
Test_Line_10489 Over the past 10 years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MDS and other myelodysplasias, including chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, through identification of common gene mutations found in these neoplasms.
Test_Line_10490 No significant differences were observed in EFS, DFS, or OS outcomes between treatment arms.
Test_Line_10491 Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.
Test_Line_10492 It is not yet clear whether these differences in results are due to the differences in the diseases studied (AML versus MDS) or in the platforms used to assess alterations in methylation, which may not accurately distinguish between 5-mC and 5-hmC.
Test_Line_10493 Splenic irradiation when using either 100-500 cGy in 5-10 fractions or 100 cGy in 4 fractions may help transiently reduce spleen size.
Test_Line_10494 Numerous studies have shown the negative prognostic influence of FLT3-ITD in patients with AML, resulting in shorter remission durations (eg, decreased diseasefree survival [DFS] in patients with a CR) and poorer survival outcomes compared with patients with wild-type FLT3.
Test_Line_10495 Clinical features of cases harboring cohesin complex gene mutations.
Test_Line_10496 The accurate classification of AML requires multidisciplinary diagnostic studies (using immunohistochemistry, cytochemistry, or both, in addition to molecular genetics analysis) in accordance with the 2008 WHO classification.
Test_Line_10497 Similar to findings with IDH1 mutations, reports on the prognostic effect of IDH2 mutations have also been inconsistent.
Test_Line_10498 Among SMC3 alterations, 8 out of 19 were nonsense (n = 1), frameshift (n = 1), or splice site (n = 6) mutations, whereas 11 out of 19 were missense mutations.
Test_Line_10499 Best supportive care includes red cell and platelet transfusions to alleviate symptoms of anemia and thrombocytopenia; prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal drugs to reduce the risk of infection; and hydroxyurea for management of leukocytosis.
Test_Line_10500 Postremission or Consolidation Therapy: Although successful induction therapy clears the visible signs of leukemia in the marrow and restores normal hematopoiesis in patients with de novo AML, additional postremission therapy (ie, consolidation) is needed to reduce the residual abnormal cells to a level that can be contained by immune surveillance.
Test_Line_10501 The UK MRC study (AML 10) also reported no DFS or OS advantage with allogeneic HSCT among patients (age < 55 years) with favorable-risk cytogenetics.
Test_Line_10502 Identification of GATA2 mutations is critical for the management of these patients.
Test_Line_10503 Analysis of clonal dynamics in patients in whom serial samples are obtained at various time points along their disease course provides important insight into the timing and effect of cohesin loss of function on leukemia initiation and progression.
Test_Line_10504 Extrapolation from studies conducted in patients with PV may suggest commensurate efficacy of aspirin in patients with ET.
Test_Line_10505 SURVEY OF MUTATIONS IN THE STUDY SAMPLES.
Test_Line_10506 In spite of their similarities, the BCOR and BCORL1 proteins show a number of different features, including their capability to interact with BCL6, their expression levels in human tissues, and their localization within subnuclear structures (Table 1).
Test_Line_10507 Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Patients.
Test_Line_10508 Because the maternal grandfather had no clinical or biologic phenotypes, we focused our analysis on the GATA2 R396Q mutation.
Test_Line_10509 Other methods used to detect V617F include restriction fragment length polymorphism, denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography, high-resolution melting-curve analysis, pyrosequencing, and various allele-specific PCR systems with electrophoretic analysis of the products.
Test_Line_10510 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy characterized by myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic features.
Test_Line_10511 Diagnosis was confirmed and assigned according to World Health Organization classification criteria.
Test_Line_10512 Somatic mutations of the PTEN/MMAC1 gene have been identified in a number of cancer cell lines and primary cancers.
Test_Line_10513 Other options include an allogeneic HSCT if a matched sibling or alternative donor has been identified, or participation in a clinical trial.
Test_Line_10514 First, mutations outside the coding region were excluded.
Test_Line_10515 Cancer-associated mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 are heterozygous and occur at one of three highly conserved arginine residues: IDH1-R132, IDH2-R172 and IDH2-R140.
Test_Line_10516 In addition to their association with sporadic MPN, MPL mutations are also associated with familial diseases.

Test_Line_10518 All RT-PCR products were then subjected to direct sequencing analysis.
Test_Line_10519 Ethnic differences among cohorts might also be a reason for the distinct frequency of RUNX1 mutations between ours and earlier studies.
Test_Line_10520 Although initial studies demonstrated that these mutants lead to reduced enzymatic function with respect to alpha-ketoglutarate production, the presence of focal, recurrent heterozygous mutations suggested these might lead to an aberrant gain-of-function.
Test_Line_10521 Figure 3. Unsplicing of specific genes because of spliceosomal mutations as detected by deep RNA sequencing. Next-generation-based RNA deep sequencing was used to quantitatively study splicing patterns. (A) The top panel shows the intron 5 and exon 6 boundary of TET2 (dotted line). Five reads correspond to transcripts that were not spliced (unspliced) and 4 were spliced at this boundary. The bottom panel shows read counts at the 5' and 3' splice sites of each intron (3-10) of TET2. White and black bars indicate the number of spliced and unspliced reads, respectively. In a case of AML with a U2AF1 mutation, more unspliced than spliced reads were observed at the 3' splice site of intron 5 (left panel), probably because of a loss of spliceosome function. However, unspliced RNAs were less frequent than spliced RNAs in WT RNA sequencing (right panel). (B) At both the 3' and 5' splice sites of RUNX1 intron 6, unspliced reads were more frequent than spliced reads in AML cases with U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations. However, there were fewer unspliced transcripts at the same site in WT and SF3B1 mutant samples. Splicing abnormalities in the selected genes are summarized (bottom right), including the results presented in detail in supplemental Figures 7 and 8.
Test_Line_10522 Ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2, has clinically significant activity in myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_10523 To simplify the implementation of the score, we recoded it into 5 broader categories of adequate numerosity by pooling consecutive score values.

Test_Line_10525 It is also possible that the phenotypic features are related to the transcriptional spectrum of cells in which the mutations occur.
Test_Line_10526 A comparison of clinicohematological features between CMML patients with and without RUNX1 mutations was carried out (Supplementary Table 2).
Test_Line_10527 These patients were entered into the multicenter treatment trial AML SHG 0199 (#NCT00209833, June 1999 to September 2004, n = 276) or AML SHG 0295 (February 1995 to May 1999, n = 113) for whom pretreatment cell samples were available.
Test_Line_10528 When compared with the cohesin WT cohort, cooccurring mutations in RUNX1 (P = .0001), Ras-family oncogenes (P = .0001), BCOR (n = 15; P = .003), and ASXL1 (P = .03) were significantly enriched in patients with cohesin mutations (Figure 2 and supplemental Table 7).
Test_Line_10529 Somatic cohesin mutations have been reported in several cohorts of patients with de novo AML.
Test_Line_10530 Because the OS outcomes for the high-dose arm in the SWOG trial (high-dose cytarabine induction and 2 cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation; 4-year OS rate of 52% for patients age < 50 years) is comparable to those of the CALGB trial with standard-dose infusional cytarabine induction and 4 cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation (4year OS rate of 52% for patients age <= 60 years), the use of high-dose cytarabine in the induction phase outside of a clinical trial remains controversial.
Test_Line_10531 None had an earlier history of radiation exposure or chemotherapy.
Test_Line_10532 DNA SEQUENCING.
Test_Line_10533 Less prominently, SRSF2 mutations were more frequently found in CMML (30.7-47 %) than in other subtypes of myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_10534 In addition, HLA testing should be performed promptly in those who may be candidates for either fully ablative or reduced-intensity allogeneic HSCT from a matched sibling or an unrelated donor, which constitutes the best option for long-term disease control.
Test_Line_10535 Category 2A: Based upon lower-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate.
Test_Line_10536 At both the 3' and 5' splice sites of RUNX1 intron 6, unspliced reads were more frequent than spliced reads (Figure 3B).
Test_Line_10537 Studies have shown that FLT3-TKD mutations can occur in a subgroup of patients with the prognostically favorable NPM1 or CEBPA mutations.
Test_Line_10538 Congenital neutropenia is a group of genetic disorders that involve chronic neutropenia and susceptibility to infections.
Test_Line_10539 Likewise, little is known about the timing of DNMT3A mutations during disease evolution.
Test_Line_10540 Again, no difference was found in CR rates (mutated 88% vs wild-type 78%; P = .39).
Test_Line_10541 Patients who experienced a remission continued to receive therapy every 4 to 6 weeks to maintain remission for up to 6 additional treatment cycles.
Test_Line_10542 We investigated its origin using 4 highly polymorphic short tandem repeats, 2 centromeric to GATA2 (D3S3606 and D3S3607) and 2 telomeric to GATA2 (D3S1587 and D3S1292).
Test_Line_10543 Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive oral ruxolitinib phosphate tablets or matched placebo.
Test_Line_10544 Patients with ET are risk stratified in the same manner as those with PV (Table 5).
Test_Line_10545 Median follow-up time for all patients was 5.1 years (range, 0.19 to 12.2 years).
Test_Line_10546 Although initial reports (354 patients) suggested SF3B1 mutations convey significantly longer OS, leukemia-free survival (LFS), and event-free survival in their cohort, subsequent analysis of 323 MDS cases, patients carrying an SF3B1 mutation showed a significantly better OS and no effect on LFS in RARS and refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia with ringed sideroblasts (RCMD-RS).
Test_Line_10547 Management of AML.
Test_Line_10548 Patients with PML-RARA or t(15;17)-positive AML were excluded from these trials.
Test_Line_10549 There have been promising results from clinical trials that involve the JAK tyrosine kinase inhibitors TG101384 and INCB018424, but their role in future therapy is yet to be established.
Test_Line_10550 These pathways can be categorized according to their function.
Test_Line_10551 Although complex karyotype (having >= 3 clonal cytogenetic abnormalities) and -5 or -7 monosomies are categorized in the high-risk/unfavorable cytogenetics group, the presence of a monosomal karyotype was found to confer further negative prognostic influence within the high-risk group.
Test_Line_10552 In RAD21, we found 2 patients with missense mutations, 1 patient with a frameshift mutation, and 1 with a nonsense mutation (Figure 1 and supplemental Table 5).

Test_Line_10554 In contrast, mutations in U2AF1 affected exons 2 and 6, corresponding to the 2 zinc finger domains of this protein (Figure 1A; supplemental Figure 3).
Test_Line_10555 Moreover, molecular defects have the potential to serve as biomarkers and probably are more suitable for the identification of therapy targets and responsiveness/refractoriness to treatment.
Test_Line_10556 MDS indicates myelodysplastic syndromes; RCUD, refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia; RCMD, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia; MDS-U, MDS unclassifiable; RARS, refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts; RAEB, refractory anemia with excess blasts; MDS/MPN, MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms; CMML, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia; aCML, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia; JMML, juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia; RARS-T, RARS associated with marked thrombocytosis; PV, polycythemia vera; PMF, primary myelofibrosis; ET, essential thrombocythemia; and AML, acute myeloid leukemia.
Test_Line_10557 Significantly decreased OS with DNMT3A mutations has also been reported in the subgroup of patients with NK-AML with wild-type NPM1 with or without FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutation in the presence of FLT3-ITD, but not in the favorable subgroup with NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD.
Test_Line_10558 RNA splicing provides a basic cellular mechanism for expression of genetic information.
Test_Line_10559 In all cases, hematologic parameters fluctuated with time, except for monocytes, which remained low.
Test_Line_10560 Numerous studies have identified BMI1, a core member of the PRC1 complex that is crucial for its H2AK119 ubiquitin ligase activity (FIG. 2), as an important regulator of both HSC and leukaemia stem cell (LSC) self-renewal.
Test_Line_10561 That these mutations were not overlapping and also not found in cases with other spliceosomal defects suggests that the effect of a spliceosomal mutation on myeloid malignancies might be inhibited by mutation in another factor or that they might not have a synergetic effect on leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_10562 We have demonstrated that somatic alterations in cohesin complex genes occur in 11.6% of patients with myeloid neoplasms in our cohort, consistent with recent reports in smaller patient cohorts.
Test_Line_10563 Conditional deletion of Ezh2 in the haematopoietic compartment results in B-lymphoid defects without alterations of stem or progenitor cell function or of myelopoiesis in vivo.
Test_Line_10564 Illumina libraries were made from qualified fragmented gDNA with the use of NEBNext reagents (New England Biolabs), and the resulting libraries were subjected to exome enrichment with the use of NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Human Exome Library Version 2.0 (Roche NimbleGen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Test_Line_10565 Follow-Up Testing.

Test_Line_10569 When choosing among these options, decisions are influenced by: 1) the expected relapse rate with high-dose cytarabine consolidation chemotherapy (which in turn is strongly influenced by cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities); 2) the additional morbidity and mortality associated with the transplant procedure, which in turn are strongly influenced by patient-specific comorbidity; and 3) salvage therapy options.
Test_Line_10570 For a qPCR assay, the threshold for a positive result must be determined, because of cross-amplification of the wild-type allele.
Test_Line_10571 Recurrent mutations in JAK2 and MPL genes are genetic hallmarks of BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.
Test_Line_10572 Although the CALGB trial did not show an overall benefit for higher doses of cytarabine consolidation in older patients, a subset of patients with a good performance status, normal renal function, and a normal or low risk karyotype might be considered for a single cycle of cytarabine (1.0-1.5 g/m2/d x 4-6 doses) without an anthracycline.
Test_Line_10573 SRSF2 has also been implicated in genetic stability, and its defect could lead to hypermutability.
Test_Line_10574 The majority of patients receiving placebo had spleen growth.
Test_Line_10575 SUMMARY.
Test_Line_10576 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Test_Line_10577 Biological impact of mutations.
Test_Line_10578 Mutations affecting spliceosomal genes that result in defective splicing are a new leukemogenic pathway.
Test_Line_10579 [SIDEBAR TEXT].
Test_Line_10580 The cutoff date was July 1, 2012.
Test_Line_10581 A higher allelic burden in PV is associated with pruritus and increased splenomegaly, and has been implicated in myelofibrotic transformation.
Test_Line_10582 In both studies, these mutations were subsequently studied in larger series of AML patients.
Test_Line_10583 Cohesin gene family sequence alterations in myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_10584 Collectively, these studies suggest that RIC allogeneic HSCT is a feasible treatment option for patients aged 60 years and older, particularly those in first CR with minimal comorbidities and who have an available donor.
Test_Line_10585 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_10586 We recently reported that ~50% to 60% of patients with CNL or aCML harbor mutations in the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3R; GCSFR).
Test_Line_10587 Although all patients with AML are best managed within the context of an appropriate clinical trial, this poor-risk group of patients, in particular, should be entered into a clinical trial (incorporating either chemotherapy or low-intensity therapy), if available, because only 40% to 50% of these patients experience a CR with standard induction therapy.
Test_Line_10588 Sequencing results containing mutations were repeated using DNA samples.
Test_Line_10589 Environmental factors that have long been established to increase the risks of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML include prolonged exposure to petrochemicals; solvents such as benzene; pesticides; and ionizing radiation.
Test_Line_10590 Based on data from a large study in elderly patients (N = 1406), patient and disease factors significantly associated with CR and/or early death were identified and risk scores were developed based on multivariate regression analysis.
Test_Line_10591 ChIP for EZH2 in the presence and absence of ASXL1 revealed that EZH2 recruitment was markedly reduced in the absence of ASXL1, suggesting that ASXL1 may be important for the recruitment and/or stability of the PRC2 complex in myeloid haematopoietic cells.
Test_Line_10592 Two patients with mutations in STAG2 had missense mutations, 2 patients had frameshift mutations, and 1 patient had a nonsense mutation in this gene (Figure 1 and supplemental Table 3).
Test_Line_10593 A stringent algorithm was applied for the identification of SNP-A lesions.
Test_Line_10594 Our results are also different from McGlynn study and Padua study of RAS, FMS, and p53, in which the loss of FMS gene, mutation of RAS, FMS, and p53 were common in AML and myelodysplasias.
Test_Line_10595 Results were concordant for 26 of the 66 specimens (ie, the same results were obtained by all participating laboratories), with 21 positive and 5 negative.
Test_Line_10596 Notwithstanding case reports of JAK2 V617F positivity in selected cases of CNL and aCML, no other recurrent genetic mutations had been identified in these diseases until the recent discoveries of mutant SETBP1 and CSF3R.
Test_Line_10597 All amplicons from 1 patient were pooled and randomly ligated (Quick Ligation Kit, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).
Test_Line_10598 Following the identification of IDH1 and DNMT3A mutations, this strategy has recently led to the discovery that two homologous genes, i.e. BCOR and BCORL1, are recurrently mutated in AML.
Test_Line_10599 Other codon 515 mutations include W515A and W515R.
Test_Line_10600 The prognostic value was only demonstrated for PMF when an "unfavorable" cytogenetic profile (complex karyotype, +8 or abnormalities other than isolated +9, 13q-, or 20q-) predicted inferior survival not already accounted for by the International Prognostic Scoring System for PMF.
Test_Line_10601 In contrast, U2AF1 mutations were most frequent in the high-risk MDS/AML cohort (11%), whereas SRSF2 was most frequently mutated in MDS/MPN (24%) particularly in CMML (28%; Figure 2A).
Test_Line_10602 Identical somatic activating mutations of GNAS have been identified in several types of solid tumors but not in hematologic cancers.
Test_Line_10603 About half of all grade 3 or 4 adverse events of anemia in the ruxolitinib group occurred during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
Test_Line_10604 In a retrospective analysis comparing outcomes with RIC allogeneic HSCT and autologous HSCT in patients aged 50 years and older based on large registry data, allogeneic HSCT was associated with lower risk for relapse and superior DFS and OS relative to autologous HSCT.
Test_Line_10605 If the relapse is detected when the tumor burden is low and the patient has a previously identified sibling or unrelated donor, salvage chemotherapy followed by allogeneic HSCT can be considered.
Test_Line_10606 However, azoles should not be given during anthracycline chemotherapy because they impair drug metabolism and can increase toxicity.
Test_Line_10607 Similar cytogenetic profiles in ET did not predominate in the older age group but were associated with palpable splenomegaly; concurrent tobacco use; venous thrombosis; and anemia, with a hemoglobin <10 g/dL.
Test_Line_10608 Kaplan-Meier survival curves corresponding to the 5 score categories were significantly different by log rank-test (Figure 6, P <.001).
Test_Line_10609 Furthermore, patients with mutant TP53 and a complex karyotype had a paucity of mutations in other genes, suggesting that this group could be considered to have a distinct molecular subclass of myelodysplastic syndromes with a unique pathogenic mechanism.
Test_Line_10610 Nevertheless the potential mechanisms of pathogenesis remain largely unknown.
Test_Line_10611 In a separate phase 3 trial with a median follow-up of 61 weeks, there were no transformations to AML in 146 patients who received ruxolitinib and two transformations in 73 patients who received the best available therapy.
Test_Line_10612 Among cases with an abnormal karyotype, trisomy 8 was more common in cohesin mutant patients (19% vs 9%; P = .004; supplemental Table 6), whereas 25/del(5q) and 27/del(7q) were less common (Table 1).
Test_Line_10613 In a large phase II study from the MD Anderson Cancer Center, 112 patients (age > 60 years; median age, 71 years), most of whom had additional risk factors, received clofarabine, 30 mg/m2 intravenously for 5 days.
Test_Line_10614 Asxl1 attenuation resulted in significant perinatal lethality, although surviving mice had defects in B-lymphopoiesis and multiple constitutional developmental defects.
Test_Line_10615 Data were analyzed using our in-house pipeline for somatic mutation calling (Genomon) as previously described (http://genomon. hgc.jp/exome/en/index.html).
Test_Line_10616 A reduction in spleen volume was maintained in patients who received ruxolitinib; 67.0% of the patients with a response had the response for 48 weeks or more.
Test_Line_10617 When taking into account the type of CALR mutation, both patients with type 1 and those with type 2 mutation had a lower risk of thrombosis compared with patients carrying JAK2 (V617F) (P = .042 and P = .021, respectively).
Test_Line_10618 The first is to characterize the disease process based on factors such as 1) prior toxic exposure, 2) antecedent myelodysplasia, and 3) karyotypic or molecular abnormalities, which may provide prognostic information that could impact responsiveness to chemotherapy and risk of relapse.
Test_Line_10619 However, the demonstrated oncogenecity in transgenic mice provides a reasonable rationale for JAK2 inhibition as a targeted treatment strategy.
Test_Line_10620 This latter condition is characterized by increased bone marrow cellularity, multilineage dysplasia, severe cytopenia involving high transfusion requirement, unfavorable cytogenetics, and poor survival.
Test_Line_10621 In patients older than 60 years, the proportion of those with favorable CBF translocations decreases, as does the number with isolated NPM1 mutations, whereas the number of those with unfavorable karyotypes and mutations increases.
Test_Line_10622 Genomic DNA was isolated and used to produce whole genome amplified DNA (by means of a kit [Qiagen]).
Test_Line_10623 The spectrum of infections associated with GATA2-deficient neutropenic patients encompasses bacterial and fungal infection with frequent skin or mucosal involvements and a higher risk of mycobacterial and viral infections, reflecting either the profound deficit of NK cells in MonoMAC syndrome or the importance of the cooperation between neutrophils and NK cells.
Test_Line_10624 Diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were analyzed from 389 adult patients (aged 17-60 years) with de novo (n = 348) or secondary AML (n = 41, and of these, 35 patients had antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome and 6 patients had treatment-related secondary AML) with French-American-British classification M0-M2 or M4-M7.
Test_Line_10625 The use of immunophenotyping and molecular markers to monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) in adult AML has not yet been incorporated into postremission monitoring strategies, except in patients with APL.
Test_Line_10626 The observation that most mutations are nonsense and frameshift types suggests that cohesin mutations lead to decreased function of the cohesin complex.
Test_Line_10627 Mutations and translocations involving mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) as well as mutations in Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) components and interacting proteins affect histone modifications and can promote myeloid transformation.
Test_Line_10628 DNAnexus software (DNAnexus Inc; https://dnanexus.com) was used to visualize single nucleotide changes, insertions, and/or deletions at the gene, exon, and base pair levels.
Test_Line_10629 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_10630 Table 1. Splicing factor mutations in myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_10631 Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and related myeloid neoplasms are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms, which frequently terminate in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Test_Line_10632 Thus, in addition to basic cytogenetic analysis, new molecular markers help to refine prognostics groups, particularly in patients with a normal karyotype.
Test_Line_10633 First, not all patients have mutations in class I or class II genes; as one example, class I mutations are only present in approximately 50% of patients with AML and, to date, genetic studies have not identified additional class I mutations in the remaining cases of AML.
Test_Line_10634 Biallelic mutations were frequently observed in AML-M0 and in myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21 and trisomy 13, but were rarely found in other leukemia subtypes.
Test_Line_10635 Reductions in spleen volume were durable; 67.0% of patients with a response had this response for 48 weeks or longer with continued therapy.
Test_Line_10636 Disease phenotypes associated ET PMF with MPL mutations include older age, female gender, lower hemoglobin level, and higher platelet count.
Test_Line_10637 A quantitative assay or a reasonably sensitive qualitative assay is therefore essential for capturing the cases with low levels of the mutation.
Test_Line_10638 Two patients had two mutations and one (no. 4) had two missense mutations in RHD; cloning analysis showed that 14 clones harbored 238 C>T (Arg80Cys) and another 8 clones harbored 251 C>A (Thr84Asn).
Test_Line_10639 However, outcomes in favorable-risk patients who have c-KIT mutations are more similar to those of patients with intermediate-risk karyotype, and these patients should be considered for either clinical trials targeted toward the molecular abnormality or consolidation strategies similar to those used in the intermediate-risk group.
Test_Line_10640 One laboratory had a higher rate of discordance than the others; it is possible that this laboratory was testing will be reliable when such testing becomes truly an outlier, although it is also possible that there were clerical errors in reporting the results to the study.
Test_Line_10641 SF3B1 mutations are prevalent in low-risk MDS with ring sideroblasts, whereas U2AF1 and SRSF2 mutations are frequent in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and advanced forms of MDS.
Test_Line_10642 In addition, SF3B1 are mutated in several solid cancers, including breast, bladder, endometrial and other cancers, although the mutation frequencies were low.
Test_Line_10643 Box 1. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers and transformation of chronic myeloid malignancies Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders of haematopoiesis that are characterized by an accumulation of mature-appearing cells in the bloodstream and include the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-ABL1-translocated disorder chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), as well as the 'classic' BCR-ABL1-negative MPNs polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Patients with CML or with BCR-ABL1-negative classic MPNs are at increased risk of leukaemic transformation, which is associated with dismal clinical prognosis. Prior work identifying the role of nucleoporin 98 (NUP98)-homeobox A9 (HOXA9) translocations as well as the overexpression of musashi homologue 2 (MSI2) following the leukaemic transformation of CML suggested a potential role for alterations in genetic regulators of HOXA cluster genes in leukaemic transformation of MPNs. Notably, mutations in TET2 (REFS 29,103-105) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 (REFS 106,107) occur in a significant subset of patients with MPN that undergoes leukaemic transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) (see the table). Although there is evidence that TET2 may regulate the HOXA cluster, more work needs to be done to determine its functional relevance in disease transformation. The most common genetic alterations identified in AMLs that have developed from chronic myeloid malignancies include mutations in epigenetic modifying genes as well as genes without known direct chromatin-modifying functions such as TP53, KRAS, NRAS, CBL, Wilms tumour 1 (WT1) and runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1). Further comprehensive genomic and epigenomic characterization of paired chronic- and leukaemic-phase patient samples will be needed to further elucidate the mechanisms of transformation from MPN or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) to AML, and how these alterations compare to those observed in classical, de novo AML.
Test_Line_10644 These supportive care measures are tailored to address the specific needs and infection susceptibility of each individual patient.
Test_Line_10645 Eight patients had nine frameshift mutations at the N-terminal region resulting in truncation of the proteins.
Test_Line_10646 RESULTS.
Test_Line_10647 Genetic evaluation finally identified a heterozygous missense GATA2 A372T mutation (c.1114G > A, supplemental Figure 1).
Test_Line_10648 Recently, a putative tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1, has been identified at chromosome 10q23.3.
Test_Line_10649 Recently, we characterized 81 cases according to cytogenetics and mutations in seven candidate genes, detecting an overall mutation rate of 72.8%.
Test_Line_10650 Despite the optimism, it is increasingly apparent that pathogenicity in BCR-ABL1-negative MPN is more complex than for chronic myeloid leukemia, and a pathognomonic mutation may not be forthcoming.
Test_Line_10651 No advantage was observed with the addition of ATRA.
Test_Line_10652 Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2 or tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2) affect 5-hydroxymethylcytosine modification of DNA, which alters methylation and haematopoietic development.
Test_Line_10653 The extended cohort of patients was used to identify phenotype/genotype associations (supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_10654 SETBP1 mutations.
Test_Line_10655 In the UK MRC AML 10 trial, significant benefit with allogeneic HSCT was observed for the subgroup of patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (but not for those with favorable or high-risk cytogenetics); in this subgroup, the DFS (50% vs. 39%; P = .004) and OS rates (55% vs. 44%; P = .02) were significantly higher among the donor groups than the nodonor groups.
Test_Line_10656 Based on subgroup analyses, however, the survival benefit with high-dose daunorubicin was shown to be restricted to patients with favorable- and intermediate-risk cytogenetic profiles (median OS, 34 vs. 21 months; P = .004) and those younger than 50 years (median OS, 34 vs. 19 months; P = .004).
Test_Line_10657 Two patients (patient numbers 5677 and 6184) had infection profiles compatible with MonoMAC syndrome.
Test_Line_10658 A subset of these patients had mutations in cohesin complex members and reduced expression of STAG2/RAD21/SMC3; indeed, we noted that most patients with cohesin mutations had reduced expression of the entire cohesin complex.
Test_Line_10659 Beginning in 1991, 81 patients with CMML were diagnosed and treated in the Division of Hematology-Oncology at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.
Test_Line_10660 Occasionally, patients with both myeloid and lymphoid markers at diagnosis (biphenotypic leukemia) may experience response to ALL therapy if an AML induction regimen failed.
Test_Line_10661 The guidelines were developed by an expert panel from the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) based on the current literature and practices in the United States and Canada.
Test_Line_10662 Data were collected by the academic investigators and analyzed by the sponsor of the study, Incyte.
Test_Line_10663 No mutation hotspot was identified in any of the genes (Figure 1 and supplemental Tables 2-6).
Test_Line_10664 To avoid infections associated with neutropenia, a large percentage of these patients are treated chronically with G-CSF to improve neutrophil production.
Test_Line_10665 The 4-year DFS rate for patients receiving consolidation with 3 g/m2 of high-dose cytarabine was 44%, with a 5% treatment-related mortality rate and a 12% incidence of severe neurologic toxicity.
Test_Line_10666 We also investigated expression signatures of genes associated with cohesin mutations or with reduced expression of STAG2/RAD21/SMC3.
Test_Line_10667 Fragmented genomic DNA (0.5-2.5 mug) was tested for size distribution and concentration with the use of an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
Test_Line_10668 Gene expression and epigenomic analyses have identified a subset of downstream targets of epigenetic modifiers, such as the HOX gene clusters, that are essential for malignant transformation by specific epigenetic mutations.
Test_Line_10669 Disease phenotypes associated with JAK2 exon 12 mutations include younger age at diagnosis, subnormal erythropoietin (EPO) levels, and isolated erythrocytosis at clinical onset.
Test_Line_10670 They display the typical WHIM-associated dysfunctions of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor pathway without mutations of CXCR4 that are frequent in WHIM syndrome.
Test_Line_10671 In our series, none of the patients bearing GATA2 mutations exhibit lymphedema or deafness.
Test_Line_10672 In patients for whom the cause of neutrophilia is not easily discernible, the incorporation of CSF3R mutation testing can be a useful point-of-care diagnostic to evaluate for the presence of a clonal myeloid disorder, as well as the potential for genetically informed therapy (Figure 2).
Test_Line_10673 In an analysis of data from patients treated on SWOG protocols (N = 1344; age 16-88 years), 13% of patients were found to have monosomal karyotype; nearly all of these cases (98%) occurred within the unfavorable cytogenetics category.
Test_Line_10674 An ECOG-led phase III trial is currently in progress, which will compare induction therapy with single-agent clofarabine versus cytarabine/daunorubicin in patients older than 60 years.
Test_Line_10675 RESULTS.
Test_Line_10676 n = 42 (mutants), 281 (WT).
Test_Line_10677 We screened the whole cDNA of RUNX1b by direct sequencing for each of the three PCR products, which cover the entire coding sequences of RUNX1b.
Test_Line_10678 Researchers should be prepared to take on this difficult task, since in the future, novel low frequency mutations in other genes are likely to emerge from the sequencing of additional AML genomes.
Test_Line_10679 Figure 1. Location and type of mutations in genes of the cohesin complex in 389 patients with AML, and associations of gene mutations in the AML patient cohort outlined by a Circos diagram.
Test_Line_10680 However, treatment-related morbidity and mortality were higher in the high-dose cytarabine arm; the 5-year OS rates were 33% in the high-dose arm compared with 25% with the standard dose.
Test_Line_10681 What Is the Current State of Practice in Clinical Laboratories for JAK2 and MPL Mutation Testing?
Test_Line_10682 The optimism for targeted JAK2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been tempered with increasing data to suggest that the oncogenic role of JAK2 mutations may be more complex than for BCR-ABL1 in CML.
Test_Line_10683 In 10 of 13 cohesin mutant patients with serial samples, the cohesin mutant clone achieved clonal dominance at the time of transformation.
Test_Line_10684 The serious and usually sudden infections occurring in 4 patients led to their deaths.
Test_Line_10685 In patients who have symptomatic splenomegaly, hydroxyurea (500 mg t.i.d.) should be used.
Test_Line_10686 From a total of 23 putative mutations in cohesin genes, the somatic status could be confirmed in 16 by analyzing remission samples or T-cells (CD3+ CD11b- CD14- CD3+), which were purified from diagnostic samples by flow cytometry (supplemental Tables 2-6).
Test_Line_10687 However, we could not detect a significant difference in OS when subgroups with RS were analyzed separately, perhaps because of low number of WT cases.
Test_Line_10688 There is also reasonably good agreement among laboratories for quantitative testing.
Test_Line_10689 Supportive Care for AML.
Test_Line_10690 Total genomic DNA was isolated and extracted from bone marrow or peripheral blood leukocyte of the subjects as described previously.
Test_Line_10691 These mutations are specific for PV and are observed in predominantly patients who are JAK2V617F negative, with an overall frequency of 3%.
Test_Line_10692 Background.
Test_Line_10693 Cloning analysis.
Test_Line_10694 All of these mutations were somatic as confirmed by sequencing of the corresponding germline-derived DNA.
Test_Line_10695 Although germline mutations in SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21 have been associated with cohesinopathies, pathogenic STAG1 germline mutations have not been reported.
Test_Line_10696 When comparing patients with reduced expression or mutation of STAG2 to patients with intact expression of WT STAG2, we identified 28 genes, which were differentially expressed in patients with STAG2 alterations regardless of whether this was due to somatic mutations or transcriptional downregulation (supplemental Table 13).
Test_Line_10697 Figure 4. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival of PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation. Vertical tick marks indicate right-censored patients. In univariate analysis, CALR-mutant patients had a better OS than JAK2-mutant (HR 2.3, P = .001), MPL-mutant (HR 2.6, P = .009), and triple-negative patients (HR 6.2, P = .001). Three JAK2-mutant patients had short follow-up and were not included in the analysis.
Test_Line_10698 Objective prognostic markers have yet to be established for PV and ET, and the risk of thrombosis continues to be the main criteria for risk stratification.
Test_Line_10699 GATA2 mutations are indicated as protein (first line) or nucleotide (second line) variations. Complete blood count was collected during routine at baseline before HSCT in absence of clonal hematopoiesis.
Test_Line_10700 Reverse transcription was performed in a 20 muL final volume containing 1 mug RNA, 0.5 mug random primers (10 mers), 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM dNTPs, 5 units RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI), 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 200 units Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus reverse transcriptase.
Test_Line_10701 Recently, a putative tumor suppressor gene, PTEN/MMAC1, has been identified at chromosome 10q23.3, which encodes a 403 amino acid dual-specificity phosphatase containing a region of homology to tensin and auxillin.
Test_Line_10702 Systematic screening studies found that such mutations do not only occur as sole abnormalities but are often found in combination, probably contributing to the phenotypic heterogeneity found in MDS.
Test_Line_10703 This study identified age >65 years, presence of constitutional symptoms, hemoglobin level <10 g/dL, leukocyte count >25 x 109/L, and circulating blast cells 1% or greater as independent predictors of shortened survival at diagnosis.
Test_Line_10704 JAK2 Sanger sequencing assays, such as those for exon 12 mutations, should report any detected mutations using standard Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nucleotide and amino acid nomenclature (HGVS, http://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen, last accessed February 19, 2013).
Test_Line_10705 Survival analysis confirmed the prognostic validity of the IPSS risk recalculation in our sample set (Table 3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_10706 Overall, in this cohort of 81 CMML patients 32 variants (17 different) were detected in 13/81 cases (16.0%) for these four genes.
Test_Line_10707 In a patient with sAML, we identified a somatic mutation (M1307I) in PRPF8 and a heterozygous mutation (R27X) in LUC7L2, respectively (Figure 1C).
Test_Line_10708 Cytogenetic and molecular lesions are the most significant prognostic indicators, with failure to achieve remission after 1 cycle of induction therapy and tumor burden (WBC >= 100,000/mcL) included as poor-risk factors for long-term remission.
Test_Line_10709 Genetic and functional studies have suggested that there are at least two classes of myeloid leukaemia disease alleles that contribute to haematopoietic transformation: class I alleles, which confer a growth advantage by activating downstream effectors of various signalling pathways including members of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), PI3K and RAS-MAPK pathways; and class II alleles, which alter the expression of key transcriptional targets in myelopoiesis.
Test_Line_10710 Interestingly, we found a similar mutation burden between NPM1 and genes of the cohesin complex in most patients (supplemental Figure 1), suggesting that cohesin gene mutations occurred in the same clone as NPM1 mutations.
Test_Line_10711 Genes differentially expressed between these 2 groups were then identified using the Bioconductor package limma and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted (ie, to correct for multiple hypothesis testing) P values of <=.001; specifically, we used the limma pipeline of voom() ---> lmFit() ---> eBayes(), which can be applied to both microarray and RNA-sequencing data.
Test_Line_10712 While compromised 30 splice site recognition seems to be a common consequence of different splicing factor mutations, there exist strong genotype and phenotype associations for splicing factor mutations.
Test_Line_10713 This first involved variant allelic frequency (VAF) analyses of cooccurring mutations in samples, adjusted for copy number.
Test_Line_10714 This suggests that mutation in early stem cells may confer an advantage in clonal evolution.
Test_Line_10715 The frequency of type 1 mutation in patients with PMF was significantly higher than that previously reported by us in patients with ET16 (72% vs 46%, P <.001).
Test_Line_10716 Indeed, we observed a higher response rate in patients with cohesin mutations treated with azacitidine.
Test_Line_10717 A complete remission was obtained, but she developed a progressive loss of neutrophils, monocytes, B cells, and NK cells associated with numerous infections (Table 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_10718 Figure 1. Cumulative incidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and marked leukocytosis in PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation. The thresholds for hemoglobin level and WBC count are those of the IPSS, whereas that for PLT count is the lower limit of normal range. Cumulative incidences were estimated with a competing risk approach, considering death for any cause as a competing event. Vertical tick marks indicate right-censored patients. (A) Cumulative incidence of anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dL). CALR-mutant patients had a lower incidence of anemia compared with the remaining patients (maximum P value equal to .004). (B) Cumulative incidence of thrombocytopenia (PLT count <100 x 109/L). The cumulative incidence of thrombocytopenia was significantly lower in CALR-mutant patients compared with the remaining ones (P = .001 in all comparisons). (C) Cumulative incidence of marked leukocytosis (WBC count >25 x 109/L). The cumulative incidence of marked leukocytosis was significantly lower in CALR-mutant patients compared with JAK2-mutant (P = .004) or triple-negative patients (P = .001).
Test_Line_10719 However, with respect to the clinical data, a poor outcome was observed for patients that carried EZH2 mutations compared with EZH2 wild-type cases (alive at 3 years: 33.3 versus 69.9%; P = 0.001) as shown in Figure 1b.
Test_Line_10720 ONCOGENES.
Test_Line_10721 The reason of rapid AML progression in patients with C-terminal mutation is unclear.
Test_Line_10722 Within our cohort, we analyzed response to therapeutic interventions of lenalidomide (n = 92; supplemental Table 7) or the hypomethylating agents (HMAs) decitabine and azacitidine (n = 140; Table 2).
Test_Line_10723 There was no significant difference between patients with or without a mutation in the cohesin complex with regard to gene expression of MN1, ERG, EVI1, MLL5, and WT1.
Test_Line_10724 These are observations in highly artificial systems; no information about abnormal splicing is available for other splicing factor mutants.
Test_Line_10725 Full sequencing of JAK2 and MPL, as well as other genes relevant for MPNs, may be performed in this manner.
Test_Line_10726 A limitation of allele-specific qPCR is that, in many cases, signal is generated in the mutant PCR reaction at high CT counts even for known negative samples.
Test_Line_10727 C-terminal mutations of RUNX1 were detected in nine patients with CMML; they would have been overlooked had the mutation analysis not included exons 7b and 8 of the RUNX1 gene.
Test_Line_10728 Because of their often protracted course, MDSs recapitulate the stages of acquisition of a malignant phenotype, thereby offering insights into leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_10729 The somatic deletions and mutations of PTEN/MMAC1 gene were identified in several cancer cell lines and primary cancers including glioma, breast, endometrium, prostate, thyroid, and malignant melanoma.
Test_Line_10730 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_10731 Despite cohesin's role in alignment of sister chromatids during metaphase, these data provide further evidence that the leukemogenic consequences of cohesin defects do not involve disrupted mitosis and global chromosomal instability.
Test_Line_10732 Figure 2. Change in Symptom Scores. Panel A shows the results of an intention-to-treat analysis of the proportion of patients with at least a 50% reduction in the total symptom score over time (each value plotted represents the moving average for the previous 7 days). Patients who discontinued the study drug or for whom data were missing were considered not to have had a response. The majority of responses occurred rapidly, within the first 4 weeks after treatment. Only patients with baseline data were included in this analysis. Panel B shows the percent change from baseline in the total symptom score at week 24 (in 129 patients in the ruxolitinib group and 103 patients in the placebo group) and at the last evaluation during receipt of the randomly assigned study drug (in 16 patients in the ruxolitinib group and 42 patients in the placebo group). Five patients with a baseline score of 0, 8 patients with missing baseline values, and 6 patients with insufficient data after baseline are not included. Whereas most patients who received ruxolitinib had a reduction in the total symptom score, the majority of patients who received placebo had a worsening of symptoms (worsening in the total symptom score of >=150% is shown as 150%). Panel C shows the mean percent change in the score for each symptom in the modified Myelofibrosis Symptom Assessment Form, version 2.0. All symptoms improved in the ruxolitinib group and worsened in the placebo group (P<0.01 for all comparisons with placebo). T bars denote standard errors.
Test_Line_10733 Tumor Samples and Tumor Cell Lines.
Test_Line_10734 Recently, several groups have reported whole exome sequencing of MDS and other myelodysplasias, in which a common finding was frequent mutations of genes involved in RNA splicing in MDS and related myeloid neoplasms.
Test_Line_10735 A claim of intellectual property rights has been made for the list of mutated genes with independent prognostic significance identified in this analysis.
Test_Line_10736 The fragments were loaded and amplified with the SOLiD sequencing control beads during emulsion polymerase chain reaction.
Test_Line_10737 All the 81 BM samples were re-evaluated and reclassified according to the World Health Organization system.
Test_Line_10738 Anemia and thrombocytopenia were more common in patients who received ruxolitinib than in patients who received placebo.
Test_Line_10739 Further analyses were performed using oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/).
Test_Line_10740 Clinicopathologic characteristics of aCML include splenomegaly and a neutrophilic leukocytosis with left shift and prominent granulocytic dysplasia (eg, hypogranular and hypolobated neutrophils, abnormal chromatin clumping, pseudo-Pelger-Hoet neutrophils).
Test_Line_10741 RNA splicing is accomplished by recruitment and disengagement of multiple snRNP complexes and other protein factors to newly transcribed pre-mRNA, through which exon-intron boundaries are recognized and intronic sequences were correctly spliced out to generate mature mRNA.
Test_Line_10742 A global immunologic defect was identified with a very low number of CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B-cell lymphocytes, and CD3-/CD56+ NK cells, along with a normal CD3+ T-cell lymphocyte count (supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_10743 Therapeutic response and clinical outcomes in patients with cohesin alterations.
Test_Line_10744 A treatment decision-making algorithm for previously untreated, medically fit, elderly patients (age >= 60 years) with AML was recently developed by the German AML cooperative group.
Test_Line_10745 A higher frequency of cohesin defects was found in sAML and high-risk MDS patients, with somatic alterations in 20% and 17% of these disease phenotypes, respectively (Figure 1C).
Test_Line_10746 Three other samples appeared to have adequate DNA but still resulted in failed amplification in more than one laboratory.
Test_Line_10747 In our cohort, we detected one case with a homozygous mutation pattern, in detail, a splice mutation before exon 17.
Test_Line_10748 BAALC expression was lower in patients with a mutation compared with patients without a mutation in a gene of the cohesin complex (P = .033) (Table 1).
Test_Line_10749 Because many older patients have some evidence of antecedent myelodysplasia, full normalization of peripheral blood counts often does not occur even if therapy clears the marrow blasts.
Test_Line_10750 Treatment-related mortality frequently exceeds any expected transient response in this group, particularly in patients older than 75 years or in those who have significant comorbid conditions or ECOG performance status greater than 2.
Test_Line_10751 Two principle studies have helped to establish INF-alpha as an effective therapy.
Test_Line_10752 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_10753 The median spleen volume was more than 2500 cm3 (>10 times the median normal spleen volume of 200 cm3).
Test_Line_10754 A routine blood test performed at 11 years of age revealed a mild chronic neutropenia, monocytopenia, and mild lymphopenia with a profound B-cell defect (Table 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_10755 In addition, the guidelines can serve as a reference guide for clinical practitioners and other health care professionals in interpretation and utilization of the results.
Test_Line_10756 She had additional infections such as pulmonary aspergillosis, recurrent oral herpes, and onychomycosis infections.
Test_Line_10757 APL uniquely responds to differentiation-inducing therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide.
Test_Line_10758 The remainder are six novel missense mutants at RHD (nos. 1-6) and one nonsense mutant, Arg293X, in three patients (nos. 14-16); whether these mutants can induce RUNX1 functional changes needs further investigation.
Test_Line_10759 Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains the most common form of acute leukemia among adults and accounts for the largest number of annual deaths due to leukemias in the United States.
Test_Line_10760 In ET and PMF, JAK2 V617F mutations and/or MPL exon 10 mutations are present in approximately 60% to 70% of patients, with no other well-defined, recurrent JAK2 or MPL mutations found in the remaining patients.
Test_Line_10761 Radiation or surgical resection may be incorporated with systemic chemotherapy in emergent situations; however, these modalities, if needed at all, should be optimally deferred until count recovery to avoid excess toxicity.
Test_Line_10762 Stata Version 10 software was used for all statistical analyses.
Test_Line_10763 Mutations associated with CN-AML include those affecting NPM1, FLT3, MLL, CEBPA, TET2, ASXL1, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, RUNX1 and other genes.
Test_Line_10764 Subgroups.
Test_Line_10765 Nucleotide positions are determined based on the cited sources.
Test_Line_10766 JAK2 exon-12 mutations are present in the majority of patients who were JAK2V617 negative and 3% of patients with PV overall.
Test_Line_10767 The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.
Test_Line_10768 Genomic DNA samples from 62 AML patients and 5 cell lines were examined. PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 5 showed abnormal bands in the cell line U937 (Fig. 3A).
Test_Line_10769 Low-dose radiation therapy (100-1000 cGy in 5-10 fractions) also is effective at temporarily resolving symptoms associated with nonsplenic sites of extramedullary hematopoiesis.
Test_Line_10770 The normal role of CSF3R in promoting neutrophil production is biologically consistent with our observation of CSF3R activating mutations in hematologic malignancies characterized by high levels of neutrophils.
Test_Line_10771 For each mutation, we therefore compared the clinical characteristics of patients who had the mutation with those of patients who did not have the mutation.
Test_Line_10772 The cumulative incidence of thrombocytopenia was significantly lower in CALR-mutant patients compared with the remaining ones (P = .001), whereas no significant difference was observed between triple-negative and JAK2-mutant (P = .292) or MPL-mutant patients (P = .627) (Figure 1B).
Test_Line_10773 Their involvement in AML emerged from in-solution whole-exome capture followed by massively parallel sequencing of paired leukemic cells at diagnosis and normal hematopoietic cells at the time of complete remission from patients with AML.
Test_Line_10774 High-dose cytarabine should also be discontinued in patients with rapidly rising creatinine caused by tumor lysis.
Test_Line_10775 Overall, SF3B1 mutations were less prevalent in patients with advanced forms of MDS, indicating that mutation of this factor does not contribute to progression (Figure 2A).
Test_Line_10776 Figure 1. Mutations and Cytogenetic Abnormalities in 223 Samples with at Least One Mutation. Mutations in the 11 most frequently mutated gene groups are shown by colored bars. Each column represents 1 of the 223 samples with a mutation in one or more of the genes listed. Darker bars indicate samples with two or more distinct mutations in that gene group. The karyotype of each of the 223 samples is also shown.
Test_Line_10777 The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was applied to compare quality of models.
Test_Line_10778 In a more recent report, Tet2-knockout mice developed a disease with MDS-like features including erythroid progenitor expansion.
Test_Line_10779 International Prognostic Scoring System.
Test_Line_10780 The 2008 World Health Organization classification of hematopoietic neoplasms includes JAK2 mutations as diagnostic criteria in PV and JAK2 and MPL mutations in ET and PMF.
Test_Line_10781 S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_10782 Importantly, conditional TET2 loss in the haematopoietic compartment leads to the development of myeloid leukaemia, most accurately characterized as CMML.
Test_Line_10783 This led to metabolic studies that showed that mutant IDH proteins acquire a neomorphic enzymatic activity that converts alpha-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).
Test_Line_10784 Thus, many phase I/II trials for AML in the older patient include categories such as CR incomplete (CRi) for patients who have fewer than 5% marrow blasts but mild residual cytopenia.
Test_Line_10785 The NPM1 mutation has been shown to be associated NK-AML with a reported frequency of 48% to 53%.
Test_Line_10786 Since 1994, multiple (3-4) cycles of high-dose cytarabine therapy have been the standard consolidation regimen for patients younger than 60 years with either good- or intermediate-risk cytogenetics.
Test_Line_10787 We also identified three samples with activating mutations of amino acid R201 in GNAS, the gene encoding the Gsalpha subunit of the heterotrimeric Gs-protein complex.
Test_Line_10788 Symptoms and Other Patient-Reported Outcomes.
Test_Line_10789 Patient number 6184 (P2, II, 1) was diagnosed at the age of 13 with an AML M5.
Test_Line_10790 Although these recent studies have increased our understanding of the genetic drivers of CNL and aCML, this knowledge is lacking in ~30% of patients.
Test_Line_10791 As shown in Table 2, all of these variables retained a significant independent prognostic effect on OS.
Test_Line_10792 For a qualitative assay, the sensitivity must be defined.
Test_Line_10793 Therefore, lower-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who have EZH2 and ASXL1 mutations may require more aggressive treatment than would be predicted by the IPSS.
Test_Line_10794 These SNPs have not been reported in dbSNP (version 137) and were not identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 healthy controls.
Test_Line_10795 Mutations in TP53, NRAS, RUNX1, TET2, and IDH1 and IDH2 have each been reported to influence overall survival in univariate analyses.
Test_Line_10796 Daunorubicin Pathway Interaction Database: http://pid.nci.nih.gov .
Test_Line_10797 She suffered from a chronic genital papillomavirus infection evolving to carcinoma.
Test_Line_10798 All the reactions were repeated at least three times with controls.
Test_Line_10799 Greater efforts in this regard, coupled with advances in epigenomic platforms, will help to gain greater insight into the role of these mutations in MDS, MPN and AML.
Test_Line_10800 The insertion resulted in the frameshift mutation of codon 130 with premature termination of the coding sequence.
Test_Line_10801 RUNX1 mutations have been described in chemotherapyrelated MDS, MDS of atomic bomb survivors or in de novo MDS, whereas RUNX1 mutations were rarely reported in CMML.
Test_Line_10802 These genetic and epigenetic data suggested that IDH and TET2 mutations affect the same pathway.
Test_Line_10803 The first JAK2 mutation (JAK2-V617F) was identified in patients with MPN and was found to be an activating mutation within the JH2 pseudokinase domain (reviewed in REF. 92).
Test_Line_10804 Data from 3 large studies have identified monosomal karyotypes (defined as having >= 2 autosomal monosomies, or a single monosomy with additional structural abnormalities) as a subset of unfavorable cytogenetic prognosticators.
Test_Line_10805 Similarly, EZH2 mutations are associated with worsened overall survival in PMF (TABLE 1).
Test_Line_10806 However, more than half of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes have a normal karyotype, and patients with identical chromosomal abnormalities are often clinically heterogeneous.
Test_Line_10807 In this Review we discuss recent genetic and functional data implicating mutations in epigenetic modifiers, including tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), in the pathogenesis of MPN, MDS and AML, and discuss how this knowledge is leading to novel clinical, biological and therapeutic insights.
Test_Line_10808 Seventeen patients who received ruxolitinib (11.0%) and 16 patients who received placebo (10.6%) discontinued the study treatment because of adverse events (of any grade).
Test_Line_10809 Activating mutations of FLT3 or RAS gene in CMML patients with RUNX1 mutations.
Test_Line_10810 Harada et al. found that patients with de novo or secondary MDS/AML carrying RUNX1 mutations had a significantly poorer overall survival than those without mutations.
Test_Line_10811 Karyotyping and cytogenic profiling is increasingly important in evaluating patients with BCR-ABL1-negative MPN.
Test_Line_10812 In the recent report of the Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, no mutations in STAG1 were detected, whereas the mutation frequency in STAG2, SMC1A, SMC3, and RAD21 was slightly higher (2.5%-3.5%).
Test_Line_10813 Adverse effects were mild and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anemia, and asymptomatic increases in serum amylase, lipase, and transaminases.
Test_Line_10814 Cytogenetic analysis was performed successfully in 53 patients.
Test_Line_10815 These mutations fall into 2 classes: nonsense or frameshift mutations that lead to premature truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (truncation mutations) and point mutations in the extracellular domain of CSF3R (membrane proximal mutations).
Test_Line_10816 The presence (vs. the absence) of mutations of ASXL1 carried a more modest hazard ratio for death (1.38 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.89]), but ASXL1, as the second most commonly mutated gene identified in this study, contributed additional risk to the greatest number of patients.
Test_Line_10817 Therefore, as shown in Figure 1a, in total 81.5% of cases harbored at least one molecular aberration (range: 1-7) with a median of two genes being mutated (range: 1-5).
Test_Line_10818 Blood and medullar tests were normal except for a mild B-cell deficiency.
Test_Line_10819 Allelic Losses of PTEN/MMAC1 Gene Characterized by Loss of Heterozygosity Analysis
Test_Line_10820 Total RNA was purified as described previously or using a commercial kit (TRIzol Reagent, GIBCOBRL, NY). The extracted RNA was treated with RNasefree DNase I. cDNA was synthesized from 1 mug of total RNA.
Test_Line_10821 Patients with mutations of these genes, as compared with patients who did not have such mutations, were also more likely to have an elevated blast percentage (Fig. 3B), but the two groups did not differ significantly with respect to neutropenia or anemia (Fig. 3C).
Test_Line_10822 The results can be better clarified by incorporating a disclaimer in the exon 12 test report: This test does not include testing for the more common JAK2 V617F (exon 14, c.1849G>T) mutation.
Test_Line_10823 Please Note:
Test_Line_10824 The exon 12 mutations and the V617F mutation are mutually exclusive; either V617F or exon 12 mutations are present in virtually all cases of PV.
Test_Line_10825 Table 3. Indications for JAK2 and MPL Mutation Testing.
Test_Line_10826 The majority of patients had improvements in symptoms, which occurred even in patients who did not have a reduction in spleen volume of 35% or more.
Test_Line_10827 The prognostic significance of some mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes has been described, but prior studies have generally examined small sample sets, have involved limited analyses of one or a small number of genes, or have focused exclusively on a particular subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome.
Test_Line_10828 In a study of patients with MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), mutations in TET2 were identified in CD34+ cells (which include HSCs), and some patients had more than one TET2 mutation.
Test_Line_10829 However, the diverse mutations likely involve additional abnormalities in other metabolic pathways; for instance, mutant calreticulin might have peculiar effects on megakaryocyte biology.
Test_Line_10830 Grade 3 episodes of bleeding (terms for bleeding events are described in the Supplementary Appendix) occurred in 2.6% of patients who received ruxolitinib and in 2.0% of patients who received placebo.
Test_Line_10831 These two cases gave no signal and a wild-type result, respectively, by the Ipsogen assay, but were detected as abnormal by melting curve analysis and subsequent Sanger sequencing.
Test_Line_10832 Presence of mutational hot spot in SF3B1, SRSF2, and U2AF35.
Test_Line_10833 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 30 healthy volunteers were used to assess the frequency of germline single nucleotide variants (SNVs).
Test_Line_10834 Frequently, in these trials, marrow examination is not performed until completion of 1 to 2 cycles of therapy.
Test_Line_10835 Fisher's exact test, the X2 analysis, the unpaired t-test and Wilcoxon's rank-sum test were used whenever appropriate to make comparisons between groups.
Test_Line_10836 Among patients with unfavorable cytogenetics, the 4-year OS rate in the subgroup of patients with monosomal karyotype was 3% compared with 13% in the subgroup without monosomal karyotype.
Test_Line_10837 Amplified DNA was used for mutation discovery.
Test_Line_10838 Clinical associations and frequencies of spliceosomal mutations in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_10839 DNMT3L binds to histone H3 tails in the absence of K4 methylation, which leads to the recruitment of DNMT3A activity to specific loci.
Test_Line_10840 For survival analyses, end points were death and the first episode of cancer.
Test_Line_10841 In contrast with our incomplete understanding of the biological implications of EZH2 mutations in myeloid malignancy pathogenesis, correlative studies have demonstrated that EZH2 mutations are a marker for adverse outcome in MDS and PMF.
Test_Line_10842 However, several lines of evidence suggest that there are leukaemia disease alleles that cannot be classified into this widely accepted two-hit model of myeloid leukaemogenesis.
Test_Line_10843 For patients younger than 50 years, consolidation with high-dose cytarabine was associated with similar rates of treatment-related mortality (2% vs. 0%) and grade 3 or higher neurologic toxicity (2% vs. 0%) compared with standard dose.
Test_Line_10844 Furthermore, we performed a survival analysis taking both EZH2 and TET2 mutations into account, as TET2-mutated patients showed a better survival in our first analysis (Figure 1c).
Test_Line_10845 In addition, 5 hemopoietic cell lines (HL60, U937, Raji, KG-1, K562) and peripheral blood samples from 30 normal control were also studied.
Test_Line_10846 Two major classes of activating FLT3 mutations have been identified in patients with AML, which include the internal tandem duplications (ITD) and tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) point mutations.
Test_Line_10847 Blood and medullar tests revealed mild neutropenia; monocytopenia; B-, NK-, and dendritic-cell deficiencies; and an hypoplastic BM with a karyotype harboring the same chromosomal alteration observed in the BM of his brother, a der(1;7)(q10;p10) leading to a partial monosomy 7q.
Test_Line_10848 Clonal acquisition of cohesin complex gene mutations.
Test_Line_10849 Although karyotype and molecular markers are powerful predictors of DFS outcomes, induction chemotherapy will be initiated before this information is available in most instances.
Test_Line_10850 The prognostic value of JAK2V617F in PV and ET is yet to be established.
Test_Line_10851 Further studies will clarify the whole alteration of mRNA splicing profiles induced by spliceosomal gene mutations.
Test_Line_10852 To ensure that more than 90% of cases are detected, the adequate analytical sensitivity of a clinical JAK2 assay should be at least 1%.
Test_Line_10853 Several methods have been used to detect JAK2 and MPL mutations.
Test_Line_10854 Secondary end points included the durability of response, changes in symptom burden (assessed by the total symptom score), and overall survival.
Test_Line_10855 A subsequent post hoc analysis of OS with additional follow-up time showed the same median OS with a statistically significant advantage associated with decitabine (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99; P = .03).
Test_Line_10856 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_10857 Moreover, loss of PRC2 components in mouse models of APL results in differentiation of APL cells.
Test_Line_10858 A minority of patients present with variant translocations fusing RARA to other nuclear receptors such as promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF).
Test_Line_10859 The role of cytogenetics in the classification of MPN is less defined than for the pathognomonic t(9;22) karyotype of CML.
Test_Line_10860 The NCCN AML Panel convenes annually to update recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of AML in adults.
Test_Line_10861 Mutations of two or more genes were present in 79 samples (18.0%) (Fig. 1, and Table 6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Test_Line_10862 Factors such as patient age, comorbid conditions, and features of the disease at diagnosis, including elevated leukocyte counts (>= 50,000/mcL) or number of cycles of induction to achieve remission, should play a role in choosing a consolidation strategy, as should issues regarding fertility and salvage options.
Test_Line_10863 In addition, in supplemental Table 1, we clarified the mutational status of spliceosomal genes.
Test_Line_10864 Congenital neutropenia is a group of genetic disorders that involve chronic neutropenia and susceptibility to infections.
Test_Line_10865 Some studies in the overall AML population and in patients with intermediate risk reported no significant effect of DNMT3A mutations on survival outcomes, whereas other studies have shown a negative prognostic effect in the overall population or specific subgroups.
Test_Line_10866 Nonetheless, overall IPSS risk was higher in cohesin-mutated patients, driven by high blast count, suggesting a stem cell defect in the mutant clone.
Test_Line_10867 Current prognostic scoring systems consider karyotypic abnormalities and certain clinical features to stratify patients with myelodysplastic syndromes into risk groups.
Test_Line_10868 However there appear to be discrepancies in this impact among different studies.
Test_Line_10869 Most laboratories reported analytical sensitivities in the 1% to 5% range; only two laboratories indicated analytical sensitivities of less than 1%.
Test_Line_10870 In fact, this identification has split PMF patients with nonmutated JAK2 and MPL (about one-third of all patients with PMF) into 2 distinct subtypes (Figure 7): (1) CALR-mutant PMF, a condition with an indolent clinical course and (2) PMF with nonmutated JAK2, CALR, and MPL, a very aggressive myeloid neoplasm.
Test_Line_10871 These latter showed a particularly high risk at 3 years (>30%, Figure 1C).
Test_Line_10872 We analyzed the effect of allogeneic transplantation on OS of patients with cohesin mutations.
Test_Line_10873 The median follow-up of the cohort was 18 months (1-168 months).
Test_Line_10874 These agents can elicit improvement in blood counts but exhibit no proven disease-modifying benefit.
Test_Line_10875 Clinically verified MPL mutations are listed in Table 2.
Test_Line_10876 ELN classifies patients with t(9;11)(p22;q23), MLLT3-MLL and other cytogenetic abnormalities that fall into neither the favorable or adverse category into the "Intermediate II" group.
Test_Line_10877 It could be possible that a negative prognostic impact of cohesin mutations might have been missed because of the favorable prognostic impact of NPM1 mutations and the strong association between these mutations.
Test_Line_10878 For this secondary end point, among patients who had a reduction of 35% or more in spleen volume, 67.0% (95% CI, 46.4 to 81.1) had a reduction in spleen volume that was maintained for 48 weeks or more (loss of response was defined as a reduction of <35% from baseline and an increase of >=25% from the nadir).
Test_Line_10879 Similar studies that map 5-hmC localization in the haematopoietic system, and the identity of specific TET2 target genes in haematopoietic cells, have not been reported to date.
Test_Line_10880 This data implements that cohesin mutations could be potentially used for minimal residual disease monitoring.
Test_Line_10881 Adapted from Tefferi et al.
Test_Line_10882 In this study, we aimed to further characterize this defined cohort of CMML patients by studying five additional genes: IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, ASXL1 and EZH2.
Test_Line_10883 In clinical practice, neutrophilia most commonly relates to leukemoid reactions due to chronic infections, inflammatory diseases, or various types of malignancies.
Test_Line_10884 The guidelines consider recommendations for patients older or younger than 60 years of age separately.
Test_Line_10885 Moreover, alternative splicing analysis showed that exon 9 of FECH was skipped in U2AF1 mutant cases but not in U2AF1 WT cases, including those with SF3B1 mutations (supplemental Figure 8).
Test_Line_10886 APL is a genetically distinct subtype of AML that is most commonly associated with a recurrent chromosomal translocation fusing the promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) gene to retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA).
Test_Line_10887 The high frequency of mutations in different components of the RNA splicing machinery in MDS suggests that abnormal RNA splicing is the common consequence of these mutations, which is relevant to the pathogenesis of MDS.
Test_Line_10888 One approach to the integration of mutational-analysis results into the IPSS would be to include a variable for mutations in one or more of these five prognostic genes (Fig. 4).
Test_Line_10889 Figure 1. Schematic representation of the BCOR (top) and BCORL1 (bottom) transcriptional corepressors with their respective domains and the location and type of mutations occurring in AML patients. The numbers above the arrows indicate the presence, in more than one case, of the same type of mutation occurring at the same exonic location or involving the splicing of the same intron. BCORL1 mutations also include five mutations that were found in four AML cell lines and in the Jurkat T-lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. The specific type (i.e. frameshift, nonsense, missense or splice-site) of BCORL1 mutations was inferred from Li et al.
Test_Line_10890 The observation that about half the BCOR-mutated cases also carry mutations of the DNMT3A gene suggests that these two mutations may act synergistically to induce AML, possibly interfering with epigenetic mechanisms.
Test_Line_10891 Similar results were reported for myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_10892 Although various JAK2 mutations have been reported in exons 12, 13, 14, and 15, in the vast majority of the cases mutations are found in codon 617, resulting in the replacement of the amino acid valine with phenylalanine [V617F, alias JAK2 NM_004972.3:c.1849G>T (p.Val617Phe)].
Test_Line_10893 They were aligned to hg19 using STAR.
Test_Line_10894 In this study, trisomy 13 or trisomy 21 was only present in one each of those harboring RUNX1 mutations, whereas they were not detected in mutation-negative patients.
Test_Line_10895 Because a familial MDS/AML was suspected in pedigree 1, we looked for a putative germline mutation.
Test_Line_10896 The sequencing of the exome was performed by IntegraGen using a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina).
Test_Line_10897 These data suggest that TET2 can function as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in most patients; biallelic TET2 inactivation occurs in <10% of patients with leukaemia.
Test_Line_10898 Subsequent analysis identified the MPLW515L mutation that resulted in a MPN-like disorder in a murine bone marrow transplant assay.
Test_Line_10899 Comparable 5-year DFS rates were reported in patients younger than 60 years with normal karyotype after either 4 cycles of intermediate- or high-dose cytarabine (41%) or autologous HSCT (45%).
Test_Line_10900 Different types of CALR exon 9 mutations and their frequency.
Test_Line_10901 Because the allele burden varies between MPN entities or between patients at diagnosis and after treatment, samples with a low allelic frequency should be included.
Test_Line_10902 The mean coverage for cohesin genes (STAG2, SMC3, and RAD21) is 265X for the deepsequencing samples.
Test_Line_10903 Figure 3. Effect of cohesin mutational status on OS in MDS. Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with MDS are shown for (A) STAG2 mutant patients and cohesin WT patients and (B) all cohesin mutant patients vs WT cohesin patients. Median OS of MDS patients with a STAG2 mutation was 35 months vs 50 months (P = .17; HR: 1.8 CI [1.1-3.1]), median survival for cohesin mutant MDS cases was inferior to WT MDS cases (34.2 vs 48.2; P = .21), and a significant survival difference was pronounced in patients with MDS who survived for at least 12 months (P = .01).
Test_Line_10904 GATA2 is a member of the GATA transcription factor family characterized by a 2 zinc finger domains binding to the DNA sequence WGATAR and a transactivation domain.
Test_Line_10905 Finally, all patients require attentive supportive care related both to the underlying leukemia (ie, tumor lysis syndrome) and the adverse effects of chemotherapy (see on page 996).
Test_Line_10906 In our studies in myeloid malignancies, the most commonly affected spliceosomal genes included SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2.
Test_Line_10907 Pretreatment samples from all patients were studied centrally by G- and R-banding analysis.
Test_Line_10908 During this transition from the FAB system to the WHO classification, the percent blasts threshold for defining high-grade MDS and AML was lowered.
Test_Line_10909 In an analysis of patients with CBF AML treated on CALGB trials (n = 110), c-KIT mutations among patients with inv(16) were associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years (56% vs. 29%; P = .05) and decreased 5-year OS rate (48% vs. 68%) compared with wild-type cKIT; in multivariate analysis, the presence of c-KIT mutations remained a significant predictor of decreased OS in the subgroup with inv(16).
Test_Line_10910 The findings of this study provide a proof of concept that a genetic classification of PMF is not only feasible but also highly relevant to clinical decision-making as regards diagnostic approach and prognostication.
Test_Line_10911 Another recent study evaluating treatment in older patients (age 60-70 years) compared outcomes between RIC allogeneic HSCT (reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research; n = 94) and standard chemotherapy induction and postremission therapy from the CALGB studies (n = 96).
Test_Line_10912 DNMT3A and its homologue DNMT3B are responsible for initiating de novo DNA methylation; by contrast, DNMT1 maintains methylation through cell division.
Test_Line_10913 The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) are a statement of consensus of the authors regarding their views of currently accepted approaches to treatment.
Test_Line_10914 Analysis for mutational burden after therapy demonstrated the STAG2 and SMC3 mutant clones in 2 cases were undetectable and the third case had persistence of a small RAD21 clone (44% to 7%).
Test_Line_10915 Previous work in a zebrafish model identified runx dependence on rad21 expression, and given the high association of RUNX1 mutations in cohesin mutant myeloid disease, we queried if this relationship would be evident in our patient cohort.
Test_Line_10916 Such mutations may lead to distinct phenotypes and, because there is effect on survival, their detection may have future diagnostic utility.
Test_Line_10917 Mutations in CEBPA have been reported in 7% to 11% of patients with AML (or 13%-15% of those with NK-AML) and has been associated with a favorable outcome (similar to patients with CBF translocations) with regard to increased remission duration and OS outcomes compared with wild-type CEBPA.
Test_Line_10918 Figure 2. The role of mutations and aberrant expression of chromatin modifiers in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. In the hierarchical recruitment model, transcriptional silencing begins with the recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and the induction of enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)-mediated dimethylation (me2) and trimethylation (me3) of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27). PRC1 recognizes H3K27me3 through the chromodomain of Polycomb (PC) homologues. PRC1-mediated ubiquitylation (Ub) of lysine 119 of histone H2A (H2AK119) follows, leading to chromatin compaction and the recruitment by PRC2 of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) to target-gene loci. Currently, EZH2 is known to be affected by loss-of-function mutations in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), and MDS/MPN overlap disorders. Other PRC2 members are less commonly affected by loss-of-function mutations and copy-number loss, including suppressor of zeste 12 homologue (SUZ12), embryonic ectoderm development (EED) and JARID2. Overexpression of a PRC1 component, BMI1, is known to result in increased haematopoietic stem cell self-renewal from mouse studies, but BMI1 overexpression is not known to be a recurrent alteration in human myeloid malignancy. PRC1 activity recruits DNMTs, including DNMT3A, which is known to be affected by suspected loss-of-function mutations in all types of human myeloid malignancies. Removal of H2AK119 ubiquitylation in Drosophila melanogaster and in mammalian cells in vitro occurs by the Polycomb-repressive deubiquitylase (PR-DUB) complex, which consists of calypso (the D. melanogaster orthologue of BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1)) and addition of sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1). However, the presence of this PR-DUB has not been demonstrated in mammalian cells in vivo, and more recent data in mammalian myeloid leukaemia cells suggest that ASXL1 expression is strongly correlated with an abundance of H3K27me3 in addition to physically interacting with PRC2. Mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) is a member of a multiprotein complex that mediates methylation of H3K4 within the promoter region of genes through its SET domain. MLL is known to be affected by mutations that result in a partial tandem-duplication (PTD) and by translocations that result in in-frame fusions of the amino-terminus of MLL to one of >50 different partners and loss of the H3K4 methyltransferase SET domain. MLL-PTD has been shown to result in increased levels of H3K4me3, whereas translocated MLL recruits the H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L. The multiple physical associations that MLL requires for its function has led to the development of various therapeutic approaches to abrogate the activity of mutant MLL.
Test_Line_10919 CALR-mutant patients were significantly younger, had lower leukocyte count, higher platelet count, and lower IPSS risk.
Test_Line_10920 All the patients with PV no longer required phlebotomy after treatment, but only 13% of patients with ET had a reduction of platelets to <400 x 109/L.
Test_Line_10921 The inclusions criteria of the registry are: neutrophil count lower than 0.5 G/L observed at least 3 times in a period of 3 months or a neutrophil count lower than 1 G/L observed at least 3 times in a period of 3 months associated with infection.
Test_Line_10922 Our results in the whole cohort of 310 patients with MDS were generally consistent with those studies.
Test_Line_10923 Notably, we found that patients with C-terminal mutations had a significantly higher risk of AML transformation (P = 0.023) and a shorter time to AML progression compared with mutation-negative patients (median 6.8 months vs 28.3 months, P = 0.022, Figure 2b), whereas the N-terminal mutations had no influence on outcome (P = 0.955 for overall survival and P = 0.759 for time to AML progression).
Test_Line_10924 Second, and more importantly, emerging genetic data suggest that there are additional classes of mutations that commonly occur in patients with myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_10925 Notably, somatic mutations in BAP1, a binding partner of ASXL1 and a probable antagonist of PRC1 activity, have been described in mesothelioma, melanoma and renal cell carcinoma but not to date in haematopoietic malignancies.
Test_Line_10926 The analysis of global methylation levels by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in DNMT3A-mutant AMLs did not reveal a difference in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) levels.
Test_Line_10927 The French ALFA 98 trial randomized patients aged 65 years and older who achieved remission (n = 164 randomized for postremission therapy), to consolidation with either 1 additional course of standard-dose cytarabine (200 mg/m2 x 7 days) plus the anthracycline to which they had been randomized for induction (idarubicin, 9 mg/m2 x 4 days or daunorubicin, 45 mg/m2 x 4 days) or 6 monthly courses of anthracycline (1 day only) at the above doses and 60 mg/m2 of cytarabine every 12 hours as a subcutaneous infusion at home for 5 days each month.
Test_Line_10928 If available, results of prior serial testing may be provided.
Test_Line_10929 In addition, high-dose cytarabine, if not previously used as treatment for persistent disease at day 15, with or without anthracycline may also be considered in the salvage setting.
Test_Line_10930 Fragments were purified and amplified by PCR for 6 cycles.
Test_Line_10931 On the other hand, frameshift or nonsense mutations were distributed throughout the entire RUNX1 gene in both N-terminal and C-terminal parts.
Test_Line_10932 ET.
Test_Line_10933 The prospectively defined cut-off point for data analysis occurred when half the patients remaining in the study had completed the week 36 visit and when all the patients had completed the week 24 evaluation or discontinued treatment.
Test_Line_10934 One patient (no. 26) had 780_797 duplication and 798 T>C; cloning analysis revealed that the mutations were located on the same allele, which resulted in frameshift and a stop at codon 460.
Test_Line_10935 Spliceosomal genes are probably tumor suppressors, and their mutations may constitute diagnostic biomarkers that could potentially serve as therapeutic targets.
Test_Line_10936 On the opposite, triple-negative patients were more likely to develop anemia compared with either CALR-mutant (P <.001) or JAK2-mutant subjects (P = .013).
Test_Line_10937 Figure 2. Prognostic impact of cohesin mutations in all investigated AML patients. (A) OS in AML patients with wild-type (WT) or mutated genes of the cohesin complex. (B) RFS in AML patients with WT or mutated genes of the cohesin complex.
Test_Line_10938 Patients who experienced a CR after both treatment cycles were eligible to receive consolidation with a third cycle of chemotherapy or autologous or allogeneic HSCT.
Test_Line_10939 Megakaryocytes are typically normal, but can include some small hypolobated megakaryocytes.
Test_Line_10940 CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) is mutated in familial AML with an autosomaldominant transmission and a high penetrance.
Test_Line_10941 In patients with monosomy 7, monosomal karyotype did not appear to influence outcomes (4-year OS, 0%-3%); the 4-year OS rates for patients with inv(3)/t(3;3) and t(6;9) and those without monosomal karyotype, were 0% and 9%, respectively.
Test_Line_10942 For those cases in which a sample was collected after diagnosis, the IPSS risk was recalculated on the basis of clinical variables at the time of sample collection.
Test_Line_10943 Mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing and are only reported if they were detected by Sanger sequencing either in genomic DNA or in an independently whole genome-amplified DNA sample.
Test_Line_10944 Fourteen months after the transplantation, no severe infection was noted and immunologic recovery was obtained.
Test_Line_10945 Germline heterozygous mutations of RUNX1 occur mostly in the Rel homology domain, leading to the loss of its DNA-binding capacity and being associated with a familial platelet disorder and an autosomaldominant transmission.
Test_Line_10946 Summarizing this data and taking our previously published data into account we were able to detect at least one molecular mutation in 61/81 (75.3%) patients (Figure 1a).
Test_Line_10947 Careful analysis of the methylome in HSCs revealed that deletion of Dnmt3a resulted in both hypermethylation and hypomethylation of different loci; notably, they observed hypomethylation and increased expression of a core set of genes that are crucial for regulating HSC self-renewal and promoting malignancy.
Test_Line_10948 Associated morbidities.
Test_Line_10949 Each potential mutation was compared against databases of known SNPs, including Entrez Gene and the Ensembl Genome Browser.
Test_Line_10950 This technique was chosen for its high-throughput detection of recurrent oncogene mutations limited to well-characterized locations.
Test_Line_10951 Sanger sequencing analysis.
Test_Line_10952 Among STAG2 sequence alterations, 62 out of 63 predicted loss of function, including frameshift (n = 19), splice site (n = 10), and/or nonsense (n = 33) mutations.
Test_Line_10953 Younger patients (age < 50 years) who received high-dose cytarabine induction and consolidation in the SWOG trial had the best OS and DFS rates at 4 years (52% and 34%, respectively) compared with those who received standard-dose induction and consolidation (34% and 24%, respectively) or standard induction with high-dose consolidation (23% and 14%, respectively).
Test_Line_10954 Although there are no FDA-cleared tests, a number of methods have been developed for detecting JAK2 V617F mutation.
Test_Line_10955 The starting dose of ruxolitinib depended on the baseline platelet count: 15 mg twice daily for a platelet count of 100x109 to 200x109 per liter and 20 mg twice daily for a count that exceeded 200x109 per liter.
Test_Line_10956 However, in AML, cohesin mutations have not been associated with aneuploidy or complex cytogenetics, suggesting an alternate mechanism of transformation.
Test_Line_10957 Hair follicles from 20 of the 62 AML patients were collected to evaluate constitutional DNA for LOH analysis.
Test_Line_10958 Perturbation of other functions of cohesin complex genes may contribute to hematopoietic transformation, particularly through their role in regulating gene expression and DNA-loop formation.
Test_Line_10959 Immunoglobulin levels were almost in the normal range.
Test_Line_10960 However, these studies have used purified mutant protein alone, and further studies of in vivo function in the presence of the wild-type allele are required to definitively establish the expression level and effect of R882 and other mutations on normal enzymatic function.
Test_Line_10961 Alternatively, these mutations may modulate the ability of class I and class II alterations to alter the methylation and/or chromatin state and to contribute to leukaemogenesis.
Test_Line_10962 OS according to JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status.
Test_Line_10963 Before the evolution to MDS or AML, a median of 4 blood counts were available per patient.
Test_Line_10964 The oncogenic role of mutant JAK2V617F tyrosine kinase in patients with BCR-ABL1-negative MPN has not been fully established.
Test_Line_10965 Current diagnostic strategies are increasingly reliant on molecular markers, and their prognostic value continues to be investigated.
Test_Line_10966 Two patients in the ruxolitinib group had a transformation to AML during the study: one patient with 7% bone marrow blasts at baseline and a history of breast cancer had AML transformation after 8 months in the study; the second patient entered the study with 2% bone marrow blasts and a trisomy 8 chromosomal abnormality at baseline and had AML transformation after 5 months in the study.
Test_Line_10967 The remarkable differences in clinical course and outcomes observed among the diverse genetic subtypes suggest that, in spite of similar clinical features (bone marrow fibrosis, abnormal stem cell trafficking, and myeloid metaplasia), the disease biology varies considerably according to the different genetic lesions.
Test_Line_10968 The randomized French ALFA-9801 study (N = 468) showed that idarubicin induction (the standard 12 mg/m2 x 3 days or intensified with 12 mg/m2 x 4 days) compared with high-dose daunorubicin (up to 80 mg/m2) yielded a significantly higher CR rate in patients aged 50 to 70 years (80% vs. 70%, respectively; P = .03).
Test_Line_10969 Systematic recording of infectious episodes was obtained from the patients' written medical history.
Test_Line_10970 KEY POINTS.
Test_Line_10971 For this subset of patients, therapy with multiple cycles of high-dose cytarabine is a category 1 option, and allogeneic HSCT should be reserved until relapse.
Test_Line_10972 Such an indirect alteration of key proteins known to be involved in malignant transformation could explain the leukemogenic effects of spliceosomal mutations, in particular how spliceosomal mutations may result in a phenocopy of features associated with known TSG mutations.
Test_Line_10973 However, their effects on RNA splicing have been evaluated only in a very limited context.
Test_Line_10974 We have investigated FLT3 and NRAS mutations in patients with CMML, and we also examined the incidence of mutations in the CEBPa myeloid transcription factor in patients with CMML who later had acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation.
Test_Line_10975 With respect to lenalidomide-treated patients (8 cohesin mutant and 84 WT), we did not observe a significant difference in response rate in cohesin mutant (50%) vs cohesin WT (52%) patients.
Test_Line_10976 Although the loss of TET enzyme activity would be predicted to increase DNA cytosine methylation and reduce 5-hmC levels, studies of the effects of TET2 mutations on global levels of methylation and 5-hmC in primary patient materials have yielded conflicting results.
Test_Line_10977 All patients provided written informed consent.
Test_Line_10978 Seven percent of 402 patients with ET displayed a Y- (6% of male patients) or +8, +9, 5q-, 6-, 20q-, and abnormalities of chromosome 1 and 11.
Test_Line_10979 The risks for neurotoxicity and renal insufficiency are increased with high-dose cytarabine; therefore, both renal and neurologic function should be closely monitored in patients receiving this treatment.
Test_Line_10980 Complications may occur in congenital neutropenia, essentially infectious diseases but also less frequently myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Test_Line_10981 This case, although anecdotal, provides a strong rationale for the investigation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in CNL and aCML patients.
Test_Line_10982 For the entire patient cohort, the median DFS and OS were 37 and 41 weeks, respectively; patients experiencing a CR had a median OS of 72 weeks.
Test_Line_10983 NCCN, in keeping with its commitment to public transparency, publishes these disclosures for panel members, staff, and NCCN itself.
Test_Line_10984 Across myelofibrosis subtypes (primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis), patients who received ruxolitinib had a decrease in spleen volume and improvement in the total symptom score; patients receiving placebo had increases in spleen volume (P = 0.52 for interaction) and worsening of the total symptom score (P = 0.46 for interaction) (Fig.
Test_Line_10985 Notably, the features of BCOR mutations in AML closely resembled those of the germline BCOR disruptive mutations causing the oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) X-linked syndrome that is characterized by microphtalmia, congenital cataracts, dysmorphic appearance, radiculomegaly, and digital and cardiac defects.
Test_Line_10986 [END OF ABSTRACT].
Test_Line_10987 Both translocations and mutations of ETV6 have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia, and translocations have been described in rare cases of myelodysplastic syndromes, but ETV6 mutations have not previously been reported in myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_10988 Approximately half of the laboratories performed single replicates, and half performed assays in duplicate.
Test_Line_10989 Among patients with FLT3-ITD and NK-AML, median OS from the time of diagnosis ranged from 6 to 12 months.
Test_Line_10990 In this study, ruxolitinib therapy was significantly more effective than placebo with respect to all primary and secondary efficacy end points, as well as in an updated analysis of overall survival.
Test_Line_10991 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_10992 His younger brother (patient number 7109; P4, III, 3) presented at the age of 15 with severe meningococcal infection associated with mild hematologic abnormalities and an identical GATA2 mutation.
Test_Line_10993 The strong association with ASXL1 indicates that epigenetic dysregulation may be synergistic in the mechanism of action exerted by cohesin haploinsufficiency.
Test_Line_10994 The intent of traditional induction chemotherapy is to produce a major reduction in the leukemic burden and to restore normal hematopoiesis.
Test_Line_10995 Ongoing investigations are trying to identify the molecular basis of PMF with nonmutated JAK2, CALR, or MPL, and to better define the distinctive features of these patients.
Test_Line_10996 In a recent retrospective study that evaluated the prognostic impact of monosomal karyotype in older patients (age > 60 years; N = 186) with unfavorable cytogenetics treated on a GOELAMS trial, the 2-year OS rate was significantly decreased among patients with monosomal karyotype compared with those without this abnormality (7% vs. 22%; P < .0001); similar outcomes were observed within the subgroup of patients with complex karyotype.
Test_Line_10997 All of these were found to have low JAK2 V617F allele burden when tested by quantitative assays.
Test_Line_10998 A complete review of other JAK2 inhibitors is discussed elsewhere.
Test_Line_10999 Mutational analysis was performed on bone marrow samples by direct sequencing of all reverse transcription PCR products amplified with three primer pairs that cover the entire coding sequences of RUNX1b.
Test_Line_11000 The incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities after cycle 1 was higher in the high-dose arm than in the intermediate-dose arm (61% vs. 51%: P = .005), but the incidence of 30-day mortality was the same in both arms (10%).
Test_Line_11001 Our knowledge of the mechanisms that promote malignant myeloid transformation has evolved as a result of an improved understanding of the range of genetic events that are found in patients with these disorders.
Test_Line_11002 Of patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis, 31% were found to have associated JAK2 mutations and often had a latent MPN, with the most common site of thrombosis occurring in the portal venous system.
Test_Line_11003 Table 2. Univariate analysis for OS and RFS in AML patients (n = 389) according to cohesin gene mutation status.
Test_Line_11004 Although the presence of FLT3-TKD mutations has been shown to be associated with shorter remission durations (eg, decreased DFS) and decreased OS outcomes in some studies, other studies have reported no impact of FLT3-TKD on prognosis or even a favorable outcome on OS with FLT3-TKD mutations.
Test_Line_11005 PV.
Test_Line_11006 In the current study, we found aberrant PTEN/MMAC1 RT-PCR products in 24% of AML patients, 80% of hemopoietic cell lines, and 13% of normal controls.
Test_Line_11007 More recently, a large series of patients with MDS (N = 317) showed that the SF3B1 mutation status was not associated with time to AML progression or OS, regardless if all patients or only the subgroup of patients with RS were included in the analyses.
Test_Line_11008 Cohesin defects were found in 11% of lower-risk MDS patients and 4% of MDS/MPN overlap patients (supplemental Table 4).
Test_Line_11009 Thirteen patients (nos. 10-13 and 17-25) carrying N-terminal mutants resulting in frameshift and/or truncation of RUNX1 proteins in the middle of the RHD are expected to lose the ability of the RHD to bind to DNA sequences and lack transcriptional activities.
Test_Line_11010 Erythrocytosis with a hemoglobin level >18.5 g/dL in men and >16.5 g/dL in women or a hemoglobin level >17 g/dL in men and >15 g/dL in women if representing a sustained increase of >=2 g/dL from baseline are consistent but not diagnostic for PV (Table 1).
Test_Line_11011 Aberrant expression of differentiation antigens present at diagnosis may allow tracking of residual blasts through flow cytometry in follow-up samples that may appear normal according to conventional morphology.
Test_Line_11012 We applied nextgeneration amplicon deep-sequencing using the small volume Titanium assay (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT, USA).
Test_Line_11013 These observations were confirmed in subsequent studies, although splicing factor mutations seem to be rare in pediatric myeloid neoplasms, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.
Test_Line_11014 More than 50% of patients in each arm had already experienced a CR when they received cycle 2.
Test_Line_11015 A recent study reported that in younger patients (age < 60 years) with NK-AML, presence of DNMT3A mutations was associated with significantly decreased OS compared with the wild-type gene (5-year OS rate, 23% vs. 45%; P = .02).
Test_Line_11016 The selected observations were validated by targeted deep sequencing using MiSeq.
Test_Line_11017 Among a total of 29 patients, 8 of 9 CNL (89%) and 8 of 20 aCML (40%) cases exhibited CSF3R mutations.
Test_Line_11018 A total of 70% of the patients were men (median age at the time of bone marrow aspirate collection, 70 years); 66% of the patients were in the IPSS low-risk or intermediate-1-risk groups, 58% had normal cytogenetic features, and 13% had a complex karyotype.
Test_Line_11019 ECOG, performance status of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; FAB, French-American-British classification of AML; FLT3-ITD, internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 gene; no., number; P, P value from two-sided x-squared tests for categorical variables and from 2-sided Student t or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for continuous variables.
Test_Line_11020 Assays that are not allele specific, such as melting curve analysis, offer the potential to detect rare variants, but have a significantly lower sensitivity (typically 5% to 10% mutant alleles).
Test_Line_11021 RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription.
Test_Line_11022 Association between categorical variables (2-way tables) was tested by the Fisher exact test.
Test_Line_11023 The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to compare measures of quantitative variables repeated in different phases of the disease.
Test_Line_11024 Candidate genes identified were validated using 2 external validation cohorts.
Test_Line_11025 No difference in OS was observed between patients with type 1 and those with type 2 CALR mutation (P = .235), and between patients with type 2 CALR mutation and those with JAK2 (V617F) (P = .311).
Test_Line_11026 Malcovati et al reported that regardless of disease type, SF3B1 mutations strongly predicted the presence of increased sideroblasts with 97.7 % positive predictive value, although it did not necessarily satisfy the criteria for RARS or RCMD-RS (i.e., 15 % of all erythroblasts).
Test_Line_11027 To determine the functional consequences of spliceosomal mutations on splicing, we performed whole mRNA deep sequencing.
Test_Line_11028 The factors included in the algorithm are the following: body temperature (<= 38--degrees--C, > 38--degrees--C), hemoglobin levels (<= 10.3, > 10.3 g/dL), platelet counts (<= 28K, > 28K-<= 53K, > 53K- <= 10K, > 10K counts/mcL), fibrinogen levels (<= 150, > 150 mg/dL), age at diagnosis (60-64, > 64-67, > 67-72, > 72 years), and type of leukemia (de novo, secondary).
Test_Line_11029 METHODS.
Test_Line_11030 The use of high-throughput next-generation sequencing for somatic mutational profiling has led to the identification of recurrent somatic mutations within the cohesin complex in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), glioblastoma multiforme, Ewing sarcoma, and colorectal and bladder carcinomas.
Test_Line_11031 Earlier studies have shown that chromosomal translocations or mutations in the coding region of RUNX1, especially in the Runt homology domain (RHD) (exons 3-5), disrupt the function of RUNX1.
Test_Line_11032 Based on intent-to-treat analysis, patients randomized to the ambulatory arm had a significantly higher 2-year DFS rate (28% vs. 17%; P = .04) and OS rate (from time of CR; 56% vs. 37%; P = .04) compared with the single course of intense chemotherapy consolidation.
Test_Line_11033 In the 2 cases studied (patient number 6165 and 6184), the vaccine antigen response was normal (supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_11034 With quantitative assessment, it has been reported that approximately 20% to 30% of PV patients have less than 25% JAK2 V617F alleles.
Test_Line_11035 Study Oversight.
Test_Line_11036 However, no evidence shows that dysplasia represents an independent risk factor, because it is frequently linked to poor-risk cytogenetics.
Test_Line_11037 PMF can be diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy that shows proliferation of hyperchromic megakaryocytes with large irregular nuclei, in association with either reticulin or collagen fibrosis, and in the absence of reactive fibrosis (Table 3).
Test_Line_11038 After secondary causes of polycythemia have been ruled out, JAK2 analysis (first for exon 14 V617F, and then, if findings are negative, for exon 12) is indicated to support the diagnosis of PV.
Test_Line_11039 She died from CMV pneumonia without achieving complete remission.
Test_Line_11040 The median follow-up of the cohort was 20.4 months (range, 1-282 months).
Test_Line_11041 The rate of discontinuation of the study drug because of adverse events was 11.0% in the ruxolitinib group and 10.6% in the placebo group.
Test_Line_11042 In an analysis of outcomes between 2 different strategies for matched sibling allogeneic HSCT, outcomes in younger patients (age <= 50 years; n = 35) receiving conventional myeloablative allogeneic HSCT were compared with those in older patients (age > 50 years; n = 39) receiving RIC allogeneic HSCT.
Test_Line_11043 To the best of our knowledge, this series is the largest one of CMML that has been examined for RUNX1 mutations and we showed a high frequency of RUNX1 mutations occurring preferentially at RHD with nonsense or frameshift patterns.
Test_Line_11044 The frequency of coexisting somatic mutations can yield insights into the molecular circuitry of a cancer.
Test_Line_11045 In multivariate analysis corrected for age, CALR-mutant patients had better overall survival than either JAK2-mutant or triple-negative patients.
Test_Line_11046 Such mutations probably constitute a new class of TSGs ubiquitously involved in leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_11047 Common to all eukaryotes, this mechanism allows for generating a large diversity of protein species in the face of limited set of genes by alternative splicing.
Test_Line_11048 Current Paradigms.
Test_Line_11049 Another 16 specimens yielded false-positive results.
Test_Line_11050 The prevalence of grade 3 or 4 anemia peaked after approximately 8 to 12 weeks of ruxolitinib therapy, subsequently decreasing to levels similar to those in patients who received placebo.
Test_Line_11051 In an analysis of data from pediatric and adult patients with AML (N = 1612) enrolled on the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (UK MRC) AML 10 trial, the 5-year survival rates for those with favorable, intermediaterisk, and poor-risk cytogenetics were 65%, 41%, and 14%, respectively.
Test_Line_11052 Of the 259 initial patients, 99 experienced a CR and were therefore eligible for HSCT evaluation; of these patients, only 14 ultimately underwent transplantation because of illness, lack of donor, refusal, or unspecified reasons.
Test_Line_11053 Quantitative tests for JAK2 V617F allele have been used to determine the depth of clinical remission and to guide adoptive immunotherapy, such as donor lymphocyte infusion.
Test_Line_11054 Similar results were obtained when only considering patients with de novo AML (n = 348) with the exclusion of patients with secondary AML (OS: HR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.54-1.73; P = .89; supplemental Figure 2A), (RFS: HR 0.62; 95% CI, 0.3-1.25; P = .18; supplemental Figure 2B), and (CR: mutated 82% vs wild-type 78%; P = .65).
Test_Line_11055 After adjusting for age, the risk of leukemic transformation remained higher in triple-negative patients compared with JAK2-mutant patients (P = .04), whereas the significance of the difference between triple-negative and CALR-mutant patients was borderline (P = .052).
Test_Line_11056 Whole RNA deep sequencing.
Test_Line_11057 Our data showed that the locations of RUNX1 mutations in CMML patients were similar to those observed in therapy-related MDS/AML rather than in de novo MDS/AML.
Test_Line_11058 The median OS for all patients was 17 months.
Test_Line_11059 At present, only limited information is available about the distribution of BCOR and BCORL1 mutations across the main cytogenetic/molecular AML categories.
Test_Line_11060 Several groups have found that PML-RARalpha physically interacts with PRC2 and that repression of PML-RARalpha target genes occurs in association with PRC2-mediated histone modifications (FIG. 4).
Test_Line_11061 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_11062 An interpretive comment should be included, indicating whether the observed mutation has been previously reported in MPNs or other malignancies or whether the mutation appears to be novel.
Test_Line_11063 These genotype-phenotype associations may reflect gene-specific functions of individual mutations.
Test_Line_11064 A proficiency test for JAK2 V617F is available from the College of American Pathologists (2013 Surveys and Anatomic Pathology Education Programs, http://www.cap.org/apps/docs/proficiency_testing/2013_surveys_catalog.pdf, last accessed November 28, 2012).
Test_Line_11065 He is still in hematologic and cytogenetic remission 2 years after HSCT.
Test_Line_11066 The paternal uncle (patient number 7107; P4, II, 3), although not tested, has a presentation evocating a GATA2 mutation with recurrent warts associated with mild neutropenia and monocytopenia.
Test_Line_11067 A rational bioanalytic algorithm was applied to identify candidate nonsynonymous alterations.
Test_Line_11068 In vitro studies have shown that short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing of TET2 expression leads to impaired haematopoietic differentiation.
Test_Line_11069 Because of the decreased probability of achieving remission through induction chemotherapy, transplantation without induction chemotherapy may be considered for patients with antecedent myelodysplasia or treatment-related leukemia who have an available sibling donor and who have a relatively low percentage of marrow involvement.
Test_Line_11070 JAK2V617F is the best characterized mutation in BCR-ABL1-negative neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence of more than 95% in PV, 50% in ET, and 50% in PMF.
Test_Line_11071 However, all these mutations accounted for a minor proportion of patients with CMML.
Test_Line_11072 This mutation has also been found to be associated with wild-type CEBPA and the absence of FLT3 abnormalities (eg, FLT3-ITD or FLT3-TKD mutations).
Test_Line_11073 Screening of GATA2 mutations in patients with mild chronic neutropenia associated with monocytopenia may be important.
Test_Line_11074 The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
Test_Line_11075 The hemoglobin and platelet counts were at the lower range of normal values with a median of 12.5 g/dL (25th percentile: 11.2; 75th percentile 13.4) and 152 G/L (25th percentile: 125; 75th percentile: 180), respectively.
Test_Line_11076 Figure 2. Cumulative incidence of thrombosis in PMF patients stratified according to their driver mutation. Vertical tick marks indicate right-censored patients. JAK2-mutant patients had a higher incidence of thrombosis than those with CALR mutation (P = .021). This difference remained statistically significant after adjusting for age (SHR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.15-4.18; P = .017), the estimated risk of thrombosis being about 2-fold in JAK2-mutant compared with CALR-mutant patients.
Test_Line_11077 METHODS.
Test_Line_11078 No treatment is indicated for low-risk patients.
Test_Line_11079 Study Design And treatment.
Test_Line_11080 In our analysis, the prognostic implications of mutations in the cohesin complex were not significant when considering all mutations in the complex together or individually.
Test_Line_11081 Genetic counseling should also be considered for patients with GATA2 mutations because of the high clinical penetrance and poor survival rates.
Test_Line_11082 We identified a heterozygous missense GATA2 M388V mutation (c.1162A > G, supplemental Figure 1).
Test_Line_11083 Traditional therapies for PV and ET remain effective, but the treatments and prognosis for PMF are comparatively poor.
Test_Line_11084 These include mutations in tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), which have recently been shown to have biological, clinical and potential therapeutic relevance in myeloid malignancies (TABLE 1).
Test_Line_11085 Overall survival was measured from the time of sample collection to the time of death from any cause; data were censored at the time patients were last known to be alive.
Test_Line_11086 These percentages are similar to those reported in published epidemiologic studies of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
Test_Line_11087 The PTEN/MMAC1 protein is a dual-specificity phosphatase containing a protein tyrosine phosphatases catalytic domain and a region homology with the cytoskeletal proteins tensin and auxillin.
Test_Line_11088 In contrast, SF3B1 mutations are associated with generally good prognosis, compatible with their association with RARS, which has a protracted clinical course.
Test_Line_11089 Four of the 5 cell lines (80%) displayed the aberrant transcripts; all 5 displayed the normal transcript (Fig. 1B). In addition, four of the 30 normal volunteers (13%) exhibited both a normal and an aberrant fragments (Fig. 1A).
Test_Line_11090 Results.
Test_Line_11091 A heterozygous nonsense GATA2 R330X mutation (c.988C > T, supplemental Figure 1) was identified.
Test_Line_11092 To determine the coverage of genomic intervals, the data were processed with BEDTools and analyzed in R.
Test_Line_11093 By contrast, the overexpression of wildtype EZH2 is commonly observed in various epithelial malignancies, and increased EZH2 expression has been shown to be caused, at least in part, by the loss of transcriptional repression by specific microRNAs including miR-101 (REF. 64).
Test_Line_11094 Based on the identification of IDH1 mutations, subsequent candidate-gene studies identified IDH2 mutations in AML.
Test_Line_11095 Consequently, we sequenced 120 cases for ZRSR2, LUC7L2, and PRPF8 and a total 310 for SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2.
Test_Line_11096 Mortality for splenectomy in PMF is 5%-10%.
Test_Line_11097 Twenty deaths occurred during the study or within 28 days after the last dose was administered (9 deaths in the ruxolitinib group and 11 deaths in the placebo group, including 1 death after crossover) (see the Supplementary Appendix for more detailed information).
Test_Line_11098 BER is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and remove specific inappropriate bases, forming an abasic site.
Test_Line_11099 The guidelines are intended to establish a helpful reference for laboratory professionals in the selection of methodologies, validation of procedures, and interpretation of results in JAK2 and MPL testing.
Test_Line_11100 Morbidity and mortality in PV and ET is related to thrombophilia and, along with PMF, the progression to acute leukemia.
Test_Line_11101 In 2005, several groups simultaneously described a point mutation in codon 617 of the protein tyrosine kinase gene Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) in BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN).
Test_Line_11102 INF-alpha.
Test_Line_11103 DISCUSSION.
Test_Line_11104 Currently, testing is based only on qualitative results, but the accuracy and sensitivity of quantitative assays may be assessed in future iterations.
Test_Line_11105 Indeed, DNMT3A encodes a methyltransferase enzyme catalyzing the addition of methyl groups to CpG dinucleotides.
Test_Line_11106 All patients with CMML were managed with supportive care, 45 of them received low-dose cytarabine or an oral chemotherapeutic agent (hydroxyurea, melphalan or 6-thioguanine) before transformation to AML.
Test_Line_11107 To further evaluate the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, we conducted the Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor Treatment I (COMFORT-I), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_11108 A phase I/II study that investigated TG101348 in 59 patients with PMF or post-PV/ET MF reported that 67% of patients achieved resolution of leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and constitutional symptoms, and decreased splenomegaly, whereas 44% achieved >50% reduction in JAK2V617F allelic burden.
Test_Line_11109 Jerald Z. Gong; James R. Cook; Timothy C. Greiner; Cyrus Hedvat; Charles E. Hill; Megan S. Lim; Janina A. Longtine; Daniel Sabath; Y. Lynn Wang.
Test_Line_11110 Compared with PMF patients, those with the myelodysplastic syndrome associated with bone marrow fibrosis have more profound cytopenia and lower circulating CD34-positive cell count.
Test_Line_11111 They found that DNMT3A mutations were present in 22% of adult cases of AML and were associated with an increased risk of relapse in a single-institution patient cohort (TABLE 1).
Test_Line_11112 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_11113 We identified mutations in 18 genes (Table 1).
Test_Line_11114 However, the way in which BCOR and BCORL1 mutations contribute to AML development is still not clear.
Test_Line_11115 Patients of 2 of the pedigrees described herein (P3 and P5) have a syndrome related to the WHIM syndrome, although the BM myelokathexis feature was missing.
Test_Line_11116 It will soon be possible for clinicians to detect a broad range of point mutations in peripheral blood with the use of sensitive genotyping methods, which will not only improve prognostication in myelodysplastic syndromes but also facilitate the diagnosis of these disorders, the evaluation of disease progression, and the monitoring of response to treatment.
Test_Line_11117 In younger patients, strategies for consolidation are based on the potential risk of relapse, with higher-risk patients receiving more aggressive therapy.
Test_Line_11118 We did not identify any other clinically relevant differences in the distribution of cohesin defects.
Test_Line_11119 The primary end point was reached in 41.9% of patients in the ruxolitinib group as compared with 0.7% in the placebo group (P<0.001).
Test_Line_11120 In the placebo group, patients with and those without grade 3 or 4 anemia had worsening of symptoms, which was greater in patients with anemia.
Test_Line_11121 Principal causes of death in the ruxolitinib group were muscle weakness and general deterioration, subdural hematoma, renal failure, non-small-cell lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), pneumonia (in 2 patients), and sepsis (in 2 patients).
Test_Line_11122 All cohesin mutations were heterozygous in nature except for mutations in STAG2 and SMC1A, which are located on chromosome X and thus result in the absence of expression of a wild-type (WT) allele.
Test_Line_11123 Patient number 7015 (P6, II, 2), born from healthy parents, presented with several warts in the extremities and on the forehead at the age of 4.
Test_Line_11124 Patients were randomized to treatment with an "intermediate-dose" cytarabine regimen (cycle 1: cytarabine, 200 mg/m2 x 7 days + idarubicin, 12 mg/m2 x 3 days; cycle 2: cytarabine, 1 g/m2 every 12 hours x 6 days + amsacrine, 120 mg/m2 x 3 days) [12 g/m2 cytarabine] or a "high-dose" cytarabine regimen (cycle 1: cytarabine, 1 g/m2 every 12 hours x 5 days + idarubicin, 12 mg/m2 x 3 days; cycle 2: cytarabine, 2 g/m2 every 12 hours x 4 days + amsacrine, 120 mg/m2 x 3 days) [26 g/m2 cytarabine].
Test_Line_11125 The mutated genes most strongly associated with a specific karyotype group were TET2 and TP53.
Test_Line_11126 He died suddenly at the age of 36 from aortic dissection.
Test_Line_11127 A multivariate analysis revealed that shorter survival was associated with older age (>65 years), female gender, leukocyte count >50 x 109/L, and the presence of immature circulating precursors.
Test_Line_11128 No standard of care exists for CNL or aCML.
Test_Line_11129 Detection of JAK2 and MPL mutations has been incorporated into routine diagnostic algorithms for these diseases.
Test_Line_11130 Loss of the long arm of chromosome 7 is a frequent event in MDS and AML.
Test_Line_11131 The most important results of this study of the effect of spliceosomal mutations on the transcriptome are that the associated splicing defects affect a specific subset of mRNAs (Figure 3; supplemental Figures 8-9).
Test_Line_11132 Twenty-seven patients died during follow-up, with a cumulative nonrelapse mortality at 1 year of 16%.
Test_Line_11133 Efforts are continuously being made to identify additional genetic aberrations involved in the development of CMML.
Test_Line_11134 These data suggest that somatic alterations in epigenetic regulators are a common genetic event in myeloid malignancies and contribute to haematopoietic transformation.
Test_Line_11135 We also found that C-terminal mutations of RUNX1 in CMML predicted an increased risk and shorter time to AML transformation.
Test_Line_11136 Within 140 CALR-mutant patients, 101 (72%) had the 52-bp deletion (L367fs*46, type 1 mutation), 22 (16%) had the 5-bp insertion (K385fs*47, type 2 mutation), and 17 (12%) carried other less frequent indels.
Test_Line_11137 For older patients (age > 60 years) with AML, the panel recommends using patient performance status, in addition to adverse features (eg, unfavorable cytogenetics and therapy-related AML or prior MDS) and comorbid conditions, to select treatment options rather than relying on a patient's chronologic age alone.
Test_Line_11138 Also, EZH2 and ASXL1 mutations were neither associated with CMML subtype, dysplastic/myeloproliferative characteristics, age, karyotype, white blood cell count, platelets count, hemoglobin or gender (Supplementary Information 2).
Test_Line_11139 Other investigators described that trisomy 13 and trisomy 21 were associated with RUNX1 mutations in AML.
Test_Line_11140 We identified mutated BCOR through whole-exome sequencing of a CN-AML patient who was selected for analysis because of lack of any known mutations.
Test_Line_11141 The clinical and prognostic implications of DNMT3A mutations in chronic myeloid malignancies are not yet clarified.
Test_Line_11142 This then leads to subsequent activation of downstream tyrosine kinases and activation of transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5, which in turn leads to transformation of hematopoietic cells into cytokine-independent clones, resulting in megakaryocytic hyperplasia and marrow fibrosis.
Test_Line_11143 The mammalian PRC1 complex is thought to be composed of only two core members consisting of RING1A and RING1B together with one of the following: BMI1, MEL18 (also known as PCGF2) or NSPC1 (also known as PCGF1).
Test_Line_11144 At the opposite, triple-negative patients had higher incidence of leukemic transformation compared with either CALR-mutant or JAK2-mutant patients.
Test_Line_11145 For patients with impaired cardiac function, other regimens that combine nonanthracycline agents (eg, fludarabine or topotecan) with cytarabine have been published.
Test_Line_11146 The discrepant findings from these studies may be a result of important differences between the studies in factors such as patient baseline characteristics, presence of concurrent genetic lesions (eg, NPM1, CEBPA mutations), or inclusion of the APL subtypes.
Test_Line_11147 Of the 15 cases that showed aberrant transcripts, 12 cases displayed one abnormal transcript and 3 had two abnormal transcripts (Fig. 1A).
Test_Line_11148 The disease course of therapy-related MDS/AML is generally progressive and may be more resistant to conventional cytotoxic therapies than de novo cases of MDS/AML.
Test_Line_11149 MPLW515L results from a guanine-to-thymine transversion at nucleotide 1544, with substitution of tryptophan to leucine at codon 515.
Test_Line_11150 To differentiate polymorphisms from somatic mutations, we studied T-cells purified from diagnostic samples by flow cytometry.
Test_Line_11151 Considering the CMML-1 and CMML-2 category (Supplementary Figure 1), a significant prognostic difference was detectable for CMML-2 (P = 0.009) but not more for CMML-1 (P = 0.063).
Test_Line_11152 This makes the accurate prediction of the prognosis an essential component of the care of patients.
Test_Line_11153 This result differs from our previous studies of FHIT and TSG101, in which deletions were located at the exon- intron junction region.
Test_Line_11154 If the marrow is hypoplastic (defined as cellularity < 10%-20% and residual blasts < 5%-10%), additional treatment selection may be deferred until marrow recovery, when the remission status can be assessed.
Test_Line_11155 As would be expected, allogeneic HSCT was associated with a significantly higher rate of nonrelapse mortality (36% vs. 4%; P < .001) at 3 years; the 3-year OS rate was not significantly different between the groups (37% vs. 25%; P = .08), although a trend was seen favoring allogeneic HSCT.
Test_Line_11156 The risk of transformation at the age of 10, 20, or 30 was, respectively, 6%, 54%, and 63% (Figure 2B).
Test_Line_11157 Allogeneic transplantation may result in favorable long-term outcomes in selected patients, particularly when undertaken in the chronic phase of disease.
Test_Line_11158 However, what we have learned is that mutations in epigenetic modifiers do not fit neatly into the established framework of class I and class II mutations in leukaemogenesis.
Test_Line_11159 Growth factors have no clear role in initial induction therapy; however, they may be considered as part of supportive care for postremission therapy.
Test_Line_11160 However, these mutations often occur together in the same patient, and several are associated with established prognostic markers.
Test_Line_11161 Table 1. Mutations in epigenetic modifiers in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_11162 Myelodysplastic syndromes are clinically heterogeneous disorders for which treatments are tailored to the predicted prognosis for each patient.

(B) Position and disease subtype for identified cohesin mutations SMC3 (i), STAG2 (ii), and RAD21 (iii). No correlation was found with any structural motif, and no mutational hotspots were identified. (C) Frequency of cohesin family gene mutations in each myeloid malignancy. (D) Distribution of cohesin family gene mutations identified across the patient cohort.
Test_Line_11164 Outcomes from the earlier phase III SWOG/ECOG study in younger patients (age <= 55 years) also suggested similar outcomes in those with favorable cytogenetics undergoing HSCT; based on intent-to-treat analysis, the 5-year survival rate (from time of CR) was 71% for the autologous HSCT group (n = 26; 65% underwent HSCT) and 63% for the allogeneic HSCT group (n = 19; 84% underwent HSCT).
Test_Line_11165 Clinical laboratories may choose to use either commercial detection kits or laboratory-developed tests.
Test_Line_11166 High frequency of GATA2 mutations in patients with mild chronic neutropenia evolving to MonoMac syndrome, myelodysplasia, and acute myeloid leukemia.
Test_Line_11167 Subsequently, a survival analysis based on a planned data cutoff with 4 additional months of follow-up (median follow-up, 51 weeks) revealed a significant survival advantage for patients who received ruxolitinib, with 13 deaths in the ruxolitinib group (8.4%) and 24 deaths in the placebo group (15.6%) (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.98; P = 0.04) (Fig. 3).
Test_Line_11168 Statistical analysis.
Test_Line_11169 None of the AML cases had mutations.
Test_Line_11170 Notably, deletion of core, non-enzymatic PRC2 components in vivo results in myeloid transformation and/or increased HSC self-renewal.
Test_Line_11171 When considering the otherwise favorable prognostic group of patients with mutated NPM1, but wild-type FLT3, no significant difference for OS and RFS between patients with our without mutations in the cohesin complex was identified (OS: HR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.2-2.14; P = .48; supplemental Figure 3E) and (RFS: HR 0.32; 95% CI, 0.07-1.39; P = .13; supplemental Figure 3F).
Test_Line_11172 ABSTRACT.
Test_Line_11173 This splicing abnormality of RUNX1 is also observed in cases with SRSF2 mutations but not in SF3B1 mutants.
Test_Line_11174 Disease phenotypes associated with JAK2V617F mutations include older age, higher hemoglobin levels, leukocytosis, and lower platelet count.
Test_Line_11175 Allogeneic HSCT in first CR was associated with significantly lower 3-year relapse (32% vs. 81%; P < .001) and higher 3-year leukemia-free survival rates (32% vs. 15%; P < .001) compared with the chemotherapy-only group.
Test_Line_11176 The incidence of acute GVHD all grades was 38% and chronic GVHD was 49%.
Test_Line_11177 Factors predicting the course of disease are poorly understood and rely on clinical parameters such as anemia, splenomegaly or leukocytosis.
Test_Line_11178 DNAnexus software allowed visualization of reads derived from spliced mRNA and those that completely match the genome, including both sense and antisense.
Test_Line_11179 The most relevant question, both biologically and clinically, is which other gene mutations are associated with the mutation status of individual spliceosomal genes.
Test_Line_11180 Secondary AML, either related to prior myelodysplasia or prior chemotherapy, also increases, along with a higher rate of multidrug resistance protein expression.
Test_Line_11181 The patients or their parents gave their written informed consent for genetic testing.
Test_Line_11182 All other lesions were confirmed as somatic or germline by analysis of CD3-sorted cells.
Test_Line_11183 Haematopoietic-specific conditional alleles are needed to delineate the effects of somatic Asxl1 loss in the haematopoietic compartment; preliminary studies suggest that these mice develop myeloid neoplasms that are most similar to human MDS in vivo.
Test_Line_11184 Mutations in IDH1 were first identified in glioblastoma through whole-exome sequencing; this led to the identification of IDH1 mutations in 12% of 149 glioblastoma samples.
Test_Line_11185 Taken together, the above features conform to those of loss-of-function mutations in a tumor-suppressor gene.
Test_Line_11186 Changes reported in our internal or publicly available (Database of Genomic Variants) copy number variation databases were considered nonsomatic and excluded.
Test_Line_11187 An allele burden of greater than 50% suggests homozygosity, which is most likely to occur in PV; it is uncommon in ET.
Test_Line_11188 As reported previously, mutations of genes involved in tyrosinesignaling pathways (JAK2, CBL, and NRAS-KRAS- BRAF) were largely mutually exclusive (Fig. 1).
Test_Line_11189 Binding of thrombopoietin to MPL leads to activation of JAK2, which phosphorylates MPL and initiates a cascade of downstream signaling events that regulate cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation.
Test_Line_11190 Mutational and methylation studies of a large cohort of patients with AML demonstrated that IDH mutations and TET2 mutations are mutually exclusive in AML, and patients with mutations in either TET2, or IDH1 or IDH2 share similar methylation profiles that are characterized by global promoter hypermethylation.
Test_Line_11191 Discordant results were categorized as false negative if more than 15 laboratories obtained a positive result and as false positive if more than 15 laboratories obtained negative results for a given specimen.
Test_Line_11192 Monocytosis is frequently associated with neutropenia.
Test_Line_11193 Postinduction Therapy: Similar to younger patients, older patients who receive standard cytarabine/anthracycline induction are evaluated with a bone marrow evaluation 7 to 10 days after completion of chemotherapy and categorized according to the presence of blasts or hypoplasia.
Test_Line_11194 Antithrombotic efficacy of hydroxyurea in ET is well established and is recommended for all highrisk patients.
Test_Line_11195 Treatment for PMF is dependent on both the absolute risk category and the presence of anemia, splenomegaly, or both.
Test_Line_11196 Mutation descriptors are not translated into the standard Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature, to avoid misinterpretation.
Test_Line_11197 By contrast, the use of Illumina Infinium 27k methylation arrays to examine samples from patients with MDS and other chronic myeloid malignancies with TET2 mutations suggested that there was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5-hmC levels versus healthy controls.
Test_Line_11198 The mutational status for cohesin complex genes (STAG2, STAG1, RAD21, SMC3, SMC1A, PDS5B, WAPAL, MAU2, REC8, NIPBL, SMC5, and ESCO2) were analyzed in bone marrow and blood specimens of 1060 patients with MDS (n = 386), MPNs (n = 55), MDS/MPNs (n = 169), and sAML (n = 149) that evolved from these conditions and pAML (n = 301), including 200 patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML cohort (see supplemental Table 1, available at the Blood Web site).
Test_Line_11199 To study the germline genotype, immunoselected CD3+ lymphocytes were used.
Test_Line_11200 Intellectual property restrictions may influence the choice of a JAK2 V617F assay, given that Ipsogen (Marseille, France) acquired a worldwide license on testing for this mutation in 2006.
Test_Line_11201 TREATMENT.
Test_Line_11202 Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is classified as one of the subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in the French-American-British system, whereas according to the World Health Organization classification, CMML is categorized to be an MDS/myeloproliferative disease rather than MDS per se.
Test_Line_11203 The 2-year OS rate was 50% and 16%, respectively (P = .001).
Test_Line_11204 The median age of diagnosis is 67 years, with 54% of patients diagnosed at 65 years or older (and approximately a third of these diagnosed at >= 75 years of age).
Test_Line_11205 Clinical suspicion of PV is most often raised in the context of elevated peripheral blood (PB) counts.
Test_Line_11206 No data are available using more than 60 mg/m2 of daunorubicin or 12 mg/m2 of idarubicin with high-dose cytarabine.
Test_Line_11207 All patients received intensive, response-adapted double induction and consolidation therapy.
Test_Line_11208 Six of 7 mutations in STAG1 were missense mutations, while one patient showed a frameshift mutation (Figure 1 and supplemental Table 2).
Test_Line_11209 Until these recent results were obtained, spliceosomal dysfunction was only rarely associated with malignant transformation.
Test_Line_11210 Single-fraction irradiation (100 cGy) of the lungs may be effective for pulmonary hypertension and 400 cGy for extremity pain associated with PMF.
Test_Line_11211 Standard tumor lysis prophylaxis includes hydration with diuresis, alkalinization of the urine, and allopurinol administration or rasburicase treatment.
Test_Line_11212 Abbreviations: HCT = hematopoietic stem cell transplant; IPSS = international prognostic scoring system; PMF = primary myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_11213 TET1 target genes can either be activated or repressed, depending on the presence of PRC2 or existing chromatin marks.
Test_Line_11214 The primers, M2u, M2d, and M3u, as described in Table I, were used for sequencing analysis.
Test_Line_11215 Mutations in histone-modifying enzymes EZH2 mutations and genetic loss of PRC2 function in myeloid malignancies.
Test_Line_11216 For confirmation of somatic mutations, we analyzed paired germline DNA from CD3+ lymphocytes.
Test_Line_11217 Patient-designated intermediate-1 risk but who are transfusion dependent or have an unfavorable karyotype are managed as high risk (Table 6).
Test_Line_11218 Patients.
Test_Line_11219 One laboratory found an S505N mutation that was not detected by the other laboratories.
Test_Line_11220 Patients should be monitored and assessed for nystagmus, dysmetria, slurred speech, and ataxia before each dose of high-dose cytarabine; patients exhibiting any neurologic signs should discontinue high-dose cytarabine, and all subsequent cytarabine therapy must be administered as standard dose.
Test_Line_11221 The presence of such a mutation would reclassify patients into the next highest IPSS risk group.
Test_Line_11222 A total of 38.2% of the patients had IPSS intermediate-2-risk disease, and 61.2% had high-risk disease.
Test_Line_11223 Their role in the classification and diagnosis is yet to be established.
Test_Line_11224 A retrospective study of 68 patients with ET found that the risk of thrombotic events in patients who receive aspirin (500 mg/day) was 3.6 per 100 person-years compared with 32.3 per 100 person-years in patients under observation only.
Test_Line_11225 Currently, mutations in DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2 or TET2 seem to have clinical relevance to risk stratification and/or therapeutic relevance in patients with AML.
Test_Line_11226 Interestingly, spliceosome mutations, specific in SF3B1, were reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Test_Line_11227 Genotyping STR analysis demonstrated that the chromosome 3 allele bearing the GATA2 R396Q mutation came from the maternal grandfather, although the mutation was not detected in his DNA sample (supplemental Figure 2), suggesting a de novo event in patient II-4 (patient number 6227).
Test_Line_11228 The median follow-up of the study population was 3.5 years (range, 0.1-30.8 years).
Test_Line_11229 Figure 3. Overall Survival. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival, including 4 months of additional follow-up after the primary analysis, are shown. There were 13 deaths in the ruxolitinib group (8.4%) and 24 deaths in the placebo group (15.6%) during a median follow-up period of 51 weeks. Tick marks indicate censoring times for individual patients.
Test_Line_11230 The process of haematopoietic differentiation from haematopoietic stem cells to mature granulocytes, monocytes, erythroid cells and megakaryocytes.
Test_Line_11231 The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze survival outcomes (OS) of subgroups characterized by the presence of mutant versus wild-type (WT) variants of specific spliceosome-associated gene mutations with the log-rank test (JMP9; SAS Institute).
Test_Line_11232 Figure 4. Overall Survival, According to International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) Risk Category and Mutational Status. Panel A shows the overall survival of patients within each IPSS risk group. Panel B shows the overall survival of patients with mutations in one or more of the five prognostic genes (TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1, or ASXL1) as compared with patients without such mutations. Panels C through F show the overall survival of patients according to the presence and absence of prognostic mutations and according to IPSS risk group. In Panels C, D, and E, the overall-survival curve for patients in the next-highest IPSS risk group is included for the purpose of comparison. In Panel F, the comparison curve is for patients in the next-lowest IPSS risk group. P values were calculated for the log-rank comparison of overall survival between patients with mutations and those without mutations for the given IPSS risk group. The IPSS risk classification, which is based on the percentage of blasts in bone marrow, the karyotype, and the number of cytopenias (Table 2 in the Supplementary Appendix), was recalculated for 428 of the 439 samples at the time of bone marrow sample collection (the IPSS classification could not be recalculated for 11 samples).
Test_Line_11233 Other options for consolidation strategies include one or more cycles of high-dose cytarabine followed by autologous HSCT or allogeneic HSCT from matched sibling or unrelated donors.
Test_Line_11234 Somatic deletions and inactivating mutations in TET2 were identified in MPN and MDS based on mapping of loss-of-heterozygosity and microdeletions within a minimal region of chromosome 4q24 (REFS 25,26).
Test_Line_11235 Low-risk MDS was defined as patients having < 5% myeloblasts.
Test_Line_11236 Mutations in the analyzed genes were used as categorical variables.
Test_Line_11237 Five laboratories had two or more false-negative results, suggesting that the assays of these laboratories may have been of lower sensitivity than those of most participating laboratories.
Test_Line_11238 DNMT3A is a member of the mammalian family of methyltransferases that enzymatically add a methyl group to cytosine in CpG dinucleotides in DNA.
Test_Line_11239 To account for the morphologic and cytogenetic diversity of these neoplasms, a well-annotated cohort of 1060 patients with myeloid malignancies including MDS (n = 386), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (n = 55), MDS/MPNs (n = 169), and AML (n = 450) were analyzed for cohesin gene mutational status, gene expression, and therapeutic and survival outcomes.
Test_Line_11240 Recent studies demonstrated the TET proteins (TET1-3) are Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes that catalyse the conversion of 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA24 (FIG. 1).
Test_Line_11241 We then analyzed the categorical clinical-molecular score as a covariate in a Cox survival regression model.
Test_Line_11242 There were no transformations in the placebo group.
Test_Line_11243 Category 2B: Based upon lower-level evidence, there is NCCN consensus that the intervention is appropriate.
Test_Line_11244 The patterns of the 32 mutations consisted of 9 missense mutations, 7 nonsense mutations, 15 frameshift mutations and 1 silent mutation.
Test_Line_11245 Heterozygous point mutations located in the second zinc finger of GATA2 have been identified initially in 4 families with MDS and AML.
Test_Line_11246 Alternatively, because DNMT3A functions as an oligomer, AML-associated mutations may result in dominant-negative inhibition of the wild-type enzyme.
Test_Line_11247 The only described disease phenotype associated with TET2 in MPN is older age.
Test_Line_11248 GERMLINE MUTATION ANALYSIS.
Test_Line_11249 A risk-assessment system to evaluate the prognosis of newly diagnosed patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).
Test_Line_11250 INTRODUCTION.
Test_Line_11251 In the group of NPM1-mutated AML patients (n = 137), OS and RFS were not influenced by the presence of mutations in the cohesin complex (OS: HR 1.17; 95% CI, 0.53-2.55; P = .7; supplemental Figure 3C) and (RFS: HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.34-2.12; P = .72; supplemental Figure 3D).
Test_Line_11252 5-hmC has been shown to block the binding of methyl-DNA-binding proteins that normally confer transcriptional silencing.
Test_Line_11253 Each of the prognostically significant mutations most likely alters the biologic characteristics and phenotype of myelodysplastic syndromes in unique ways, as is the case for cytogenetic abnormalities, with complex interactions among combinations of genetic and epigenetic lesions.
Test_Line_11254 Yildrim et al found that the nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase (NURD) complex member methyl-CpG binding domain protein 3 (MBD3) specifically recognizes 5-hmC in embryonic stem cells and represses the transcription of genes marked by 5-hmC.
Test_Line_11255 For instance, U2AF1 mutations were associated with defective splicing of intron 5 of TET2 at both splice sites (Figure 3A; supplemental Figure 6), whereas splicing of other TET2 introns were less affected.
Test_Line_11256 In the subgroup of patients younger than 60 years with favorable-risk AML (NPM1 mutation without FLT3-ITD) in a study of patients with NK-AML, IDH1 mutation was associated with a significantly decreased 5-year DFS rate (42% vs. 59%; P = .046) and trend for decreased OS rate (50% vs. 63%) compared with patients who had wild-type IDH.
Test_Line_11257 The second objective focuses on patient-specific factors, including assessment of comorbid conditions, which may affect an individual's ability to tolerate chemotherapy.
Test_Line_11258 ASXL1 mutations in epigenetic repatterning and myeloid transformation.
Test_Line_11259 The majority of abnormalities in PV were associated with age >=60 years.
Test_Line_11260 Mutations in other PRC2 components are less common than EZH2 mutations in patients with myeloid malignancies: 1.4% of patients with PMF or MDS/MPN overlap disorders have SUZ12 mutations and less than 1% have EED deletions or mutations.
Test_Line_11261 These nonsense mutations are likely be sensitive to nonsense-mediated decay and would be null alleles similar in effect to whole gene deletions.
Test_Line_11262 Cutoffs for low expression of STAG2 was considered the bottom 7.5% transcript levels, and high expressors were considered the top 25%.
Test_Line_11263 MPL and JAK2 mutations are not mutually exclusive, and rare cases of concurrent MPL mutation and JAK2 V617F mutation have been reported.
Test_Line_11264 The median, lower, and upper interquartile values depict the distribution of quantitative variables.
Test_Line_11265 The number of patient-years of exposure was 105 in the ruxolitinib group and 87 in the placebo group; study discontinuation and crossover to ruxolitinib accounted for lower exposure in the placebo group.
Test_Line_11266 No OS advantage was observed despite the increased response to HMAs.
Test_Line_11267 During the past decade, a number of gene mutations have been identified in MDS.
Test_Line_11268 Mutations or deletions in tumor-related genes are frequently accompanied by loss of the remaining allele or alleles (loss of heterozygosity, LOH), leading to the inactivation of these tumor suppressor genes, which is thought to be involved in a multi-step accumulation of gene alterations crucial to leukemogenesis.
Test_Line_11269 Sixteen of 30 RUNX1 mutation-positive CMML patients (53%) progressed to AML compared with 17 of 51 RUNX1 mutationnegative patients (33%) (P = 0.102).
Test_Line_11270 For these patients, the panel feels it is reasonable to offer low-intensity therapy or best supportive care.
Test_Line_11271 The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency, clinical implications, and prognostic influence of mutations in the cohesin complex in the context of other prognostic markers in a cohort of 389 uniformly treated AML patients.
Test_Line_11272 National Cancer Institute Drug Dictionary: http://www.cancer.gov/drugdictionary .
Test_Line_11273 Clinical effect of driver mutations of JAK2, CALR, or MPL in primary myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_11274 Methods.
Test_Line_11275 Expression signatures associated with cohesin defects.
Test_Line_11276 Although no propensity to malignancy has been described, these children have a markedly abbreviated lifespan, abrogating the oncogenic propensity of these defects.
Test_Line_11277 Of the 53 CMML patients who had cytogenetic examinations, 30 had normal karyotypes.
Test_Line_11278 CSF3R and SETBP1 mutations are not mutually exclusive in CNL/aCML.
Test_Line_11279 Findings from published reports on the prognostic effects of IDH1 mutations have been inconsistent.
Test_Line_11280 The role of myeloablative allogeneic HSCT is limited in older patients because of significant comorbidities; however, ongoing interest has been shown in reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic HSCT as consolidation therapy.
Test_Line_11281 The clinical utility of quantification of V617F has not yet been established.
Test_Line_11282 Although data are emerging on the prognostic relevance of mutations in the IDH and DNMT3A genes (see earlier discussions), the role of these molecular lesions on the risk stratification of patients with AML remains to be defined.
Test_Line_11283 As expected, promoters of genes that are required for specific haematopoietic cell fates are often demethylated as progenitor cells differentiate, whereas genes that are responsible for maintaining a stem or progenitor state such as meis homeobox 1 (MEIS1) and homeobox A9 (HOXA9) become increasingly methylated with differentiation.
Test_Line_11284 OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and survival curves of different subgroups (JAK2-mutant, CALR-mutant, MPL-mutant, and triple-negative patients) were compared by the log-rank test.
Test_Line_11285 LOH Analysis.
Test_Line_11286 We found that C-terminal mutations were associated with a significantly higher risk of AML transformation compared with those without mutations.
Test_Line_11287 Conceptually, mutations of spliceosomal proteins could result in defective splicing, including intron retention, altered splice site recognition, or altered alternative splicing.
Test_Line_11288 Although allogeneic stem-cell transplantation may cure myelofibrosis, few patients are eligible for this treatment.
Test_Line_11289 Online databases, such as the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC; Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic, last accessed February 19, 2013) and the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP; National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp, last accessed February 19, 2013), are particularly useful for determining whether an uncommon abnormality has been previously reported.
Test_Line_11290 Figure 1. Change in Spleen Volume. Panel A shows the results of the intention-to-treat analysis of the percentage of patients in each study group who reached the primary end point of a reduction of 35% or more in spleen volume as assessed by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Patients who discontinued the study drug before week 24 or crossed over before week 24 were counted as not having had a response. Only patients with baseline data were included in this analysis. I bars denote 95% confidence intervals. CI denotes confidence interval. Panel B shows the percent change from baseline in spleen volume at week 24 (in 139 patients in the ruxolitinib group and 106 in the placebo group) or at the last evaluation before week 24 (in 16 patients in the ruxolitinib group and 47 in the placebo group). Data for 1 patient with a missing baseline value are not included on the graph. Most patients in the ruxolitinib group (150 of 155) had a reduction in spleen volume, whereas most patients in the placebo group had either an increase in spleen volume (102 of 153 patients) or no change (15 of 153 patients). Panel C shows the median percent change in spleen volume as assessed by means of MRI or CT over time. Reductions in spleen volume were apparent at the first on-study measurement at 12 weeks and were maintained over the course of the study. The upper edge of each I bar corresponds to the 75th percentile, and the lower edge to the 25th percentile.
Test_Line_11291 Another recent study also showed that in younger patients (age < 60 years) with NK-AML, DNMT3A mutation was associated with significantly decreased DFS (3-year rate, 20% vs. 49%; P = .007) and a trend toward decreased OS.
Test_Line_11292 Patients treated in the high-dose cytarabine arm received a second high-dose cycle for consolidation, whereas patients in the standard-dose arm were randomized to receive consolidation therapy with either 2 cycles of standard-dose cytarabine or 1 cycle of high-dose cytarabine plus daunorubicin.
Test_Line_11293 RNA splicing is initiated by the recognition of 50 splice site by a U1 snRNP complex, followed by the recruitment of a complex consisting of a U2AF35/65 heterodimer, ZRSR2 and an SR protein such as SRSF1 or 2, and other factors to recognize the 30 splice site.
Test_Line_11294 The algorithm, with or without knowledge of cytogenetic or molecular risk factors, predicts the probability of achieving a CR and the risk for an early death for elderly patients with untreated AML, who are medically fit and therefore considered eligible for intensive treatments.
Test_Line_11295 Both BCOR and BCORL1 genes are located on the X-chromosome and encode for large nuclear proteins that are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues.
Test_Line_11296 To examine the potential association of cohesin complex mutations with other somatic defects, cases with mutated cohesin complex genes were compared with WT.
Test_Line_11297 Mutations in six genes - ASXL1,RUNX1, TP53, EZH2, CBL, and ETV6 - were significant predictors of poor overall survival, after adjustment for IPSS risk group, and were found in 74 of 255 samples (29.0%) with normal cytogenetic features.
Test_Line_11298 In the presence of functional spliceosomal machinery, sequencing reads are expected not to cross the intron/exon boundaries and therefore should not contain any intronic sequences.
Test_Line_11299 According to the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic criteria for CNL, the leukocytosis is >=25 x 109/L; >80% of leukocytes are segmented neutrophils/band forms; and <10% are immature granulocytes.
Test_Line_11300 Improvements in symptoms were measured with the use of the modified MFSAF, version 2.0, diary, a tool designed specifically to assess symptoms of myelofibrosis.
Test_Line_11301 Two patients in our series (P1, patient number 6227 and P6, patient number 7015) were treated with hematopoietic growth factors without benefits (lenograstim followed by sargramostim in one patient and filgrastim in the other).
Test_Line_11302 Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were filtered using COSMIC v53 and dbSNP135 databases for nonsynonymous variants with a reading call higher than 5, leading to the identification of 8 SNVs: EPHB6 T483P, ERN V458G, GATA2 R396Q, IMPG2 P1161L, KDM5C V858G, MAST4 K2422E, NEK11 D87Y, and TTN P4737R.
Test_Line_11303 In fact, 4 of 5 patients with truncation mutations also had the T618I point mutation, indicating that acquisition of both classes of mutations may be advantageous for tumor pathogenesis.
Test_Line_11304 Transplant should be considered only if the patient has entered remission or in the context of a clinical trial.
Test_Line_11305 We selected for GATA2 by screening 14 probands from a series of 544 patients included in the registry.
Test_Line_11306 A total of 66 specimens were shared among the 22 laboratories that participated (18 in the United States, 2 in Canada, and 2 in Asia).
Test_Line_11307 Herein, we discuss the potential impact of these findings for the classification and treatment of these disorders.
Test_Line_11308 In conclusion, BCOR and BCORL1 add to the growing list of genes recurrently mutated in AML.
Test_Line_11309 Considering the independent significance of driver mutations, we developed a prognostic model that includes JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutation status in addition to the IPSS variables.
Test_Line_11310 Moreover, patients with C-terminal mutations progressed to AML more rapidly.
Test_Line_11311 The C-terminal missense mutation has not been reported earlier and all of the earlier identified C-terminal mutations resulted in frameshifts.
Test_Line_11312 Demonstration of exon 12 mutation in these patients is particularly helpful for ruling out reactive erythrocytosis.

Test_Line_11340 In contrast, patients with an isolated FLT3-ITD mutation and normal karyotype have an outlook similar to those with poor-risk cytogenetics and should be considered for a clinical trial or early allogeneic HSCT.
Test_Line_11341 Other mutations, including those in LUC7L2, ZRSR2, and PRPF8, appear to be less prevalent, and, because of the small number of positive cases within the already large cohort studied, we were unable to establish whether these mutations correlated with characteristic phenotypic features and survival.
Test_Line_11342 Figure 5. Analysis of cohesin expression identifies a discrete subset of low expressors. (A) Expression of STAG2 in MDS and pAML subtypes. A discrete subset of patients exhibit low STAG2 expression defined as <2 standard deviations below the mean as compared with 17 healthy donors. This was more prevalent in patients with highrisk MDS and non-core binding factor AML without complex cytogenetics. (B) Percent of low expressors in cohesin genes. The frequency of cohesin low expressors for each cohesin complex gene (STAG2, RAD21, SMC1A, SMC3, STAG1, and PDS5B) is shown by disease subtype.

Test_Line_11365 Figure 5. Proposed updated model of myeloid malignancy pathogenesis based on mutational data from patient samples. The myeloid malignancies have previously been thought to be induced by mutations in genes that normally promote increased growth or enhance survival (so-called class I genetic alterations) in concert with co-occurring mutations in genes that are normally involved in haematopoietic differentiation (so-called class II genetic alterations). Mutations in class I genes consist of activating mutations in genes such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), NRAS, KRAS and KIT. These class I alterations are rarely co-occurring, which is consistent with their overlapping function in myeloid malignancy transformation. This is visually depicted using primary data from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in the form of a Circos diagram. Recently, a series of mutually exclusive mutations that affect DNA hydroxymethylation have been found in patients with myeloid malignancies; these include tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2 mutations, and potentially other heretofore unidentified disease alleles. Class II mutations occur in genes that are involved in regulating the chromatin state (such as mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) and additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1)) or DNA methylation (such as DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A)); again, these mutations rarely co-occur, which is consistent with redundant roles in oncogenic transformation. Moreover, functional data of several genes in this new class of epigenetic modifier mutation have been found to affect both cellular proliferation as well as cellular differentiation (for example, translocations in MLL as well as loss-of-function mutations in TET2). On this basis, a revised model of myeloid malignancy pathogenesis is depicted here, in which mutations in class I, class II and in two novel classes of epigenetic modifier genes co-occur to promote myeloid transformation. CBF, CCAAT-binding factor; CEBPA, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-alpha; NPM1, nucleophosmin; RUNX1, runt-related transcription factor 1.

Test_Line_11368 Despite the importance of BMI1 in the regulation of stem cell self-renewal, recurrent somatic mutations in PRC1 members have not been described thus far in haematopoietic malignancies.
Test_Line_11369 Recent work demonstrated that ectopic overexpression of EZH2 also results in myeloid transformation, implying that EZH2 may serve as both an oncogene and a tumour suppressor gene in the myeloid compartment.
Test_Line_11370 With the use of this targeted approach, we identified mutations in ZRSR2 (W153X) and SRSF2 (P95R; Figure 1D-E).
Test_Line_11371 Moreover, recent studies have found that several class I and class II alterations that are central to the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies have direct epigenetic functions in addition to their canonical roles in promoting haematopoietic cell proliferation.

Test_Line_11377 According to our preliminary results, U2AF1 mutations seem to be most commonly associated with ASXL1 and TET2 mutations, whereas SF3B1 can occur in the context of RUNX1 mutations (data not shown).
Test_Line_11378 We found that among the initially screened cohort of patients with myeloid malignancies, mutations were highly recurrent in U2AF1, SF3B1, and SRSF2, whereas mutations of other spliceosomal genes were each detected in 1 of 120 cases, indicating a frequency of < 1%.

Test_Line_11386 The reported DNA concentrations for the 66 specimens ranged from 0.3 to 318 ng/mL.
Test_Line_11387 Outcomes were poor for patients with monosomal karyotype at baseline (n = 83), although the high-dose regimen was associated with significantly improved rates of 5-year EFS (13% vs. 0%; P = .02) and OS (16% vs. 0%; P = .02) compared with those of the intermediate-dose in this subgroup.
Test_Line_11388 Interestingly, cohesin genes have been found to bind to CCCTC-binding factor, a sequence-specific transcription factor that is known to interact with NPM1 in addition to regulating tumor suppressor loci.
